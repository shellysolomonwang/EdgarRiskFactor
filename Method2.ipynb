Business  OVERVIEW  BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK; together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is the world’s largest publicly traded investment management firm with employees in more than 30 countries who serve clients in over 100 countries across the globe. We provide a broad range of investment and risk management services and had $4.324 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) at December 31, 2013. Our clients include retail, including high net worth, and institutional investors, comprised of pension funds, official institutions, endowments, insurance companies, corporations, financial institutions, central banks and sovereign wealth funds. The Company is highly regulated and serves its clients as a fiduciary. We do not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of our clients.  Our unique platform enables us to offer active and passive products and risk management capabilities to develop tailored solutions for clients. Our product range includes single- and multi-asset portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and/or money market instruments. We offer our products directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares® exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and other exchange-traded products (together with ETFs, “ETPs”), collective investment funds and separate accounts. We also offer our BlackRock Solutions® (“BRS”) risk management and advisory services primarily to institutional investors.  BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and over two-thirds of its Board of Directors consisting of independent directors. At December 31, 2013, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) held 20.9% of BlackRock’s voting common stock and 21.9% of BlackRock’s capital stock, which includes outstanding common stock and nonvoting preferred stock.  Management seeks to achieve attractive returns for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on the following factors:        •   the Company’s diversified active and passive product offerings, which enhance its ability to offer a variety of traditional and alternative investment products across the risk spectrum and to tailor single- and multi-asset investment solutions to address specific client needs;      •   the Company’s focus on strong performance providing alpha for active products and limited or no tracking error for passive products;        •   the Company’s longstanding commitment to risk management and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BRS products and services;        •   the Company’s positioning in the face of macro challenges driving trends in investor behavior, including the secular shift to passive investing and ETPs, a focus on income and retirement, and barbelling of risk using passive and active products, including alternatives;        •   the Company’s global presence and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 48% of employees outside the United States supporting local investment capabilities and serving clients, and approximately 44% of total AUM managed for clients domiciled outside the United States; and        •   the growing recognition of the global BlackRock brand, and the depth and breadth of the Company’s intellectual capital.  BlackRock operates in a global marketplace characterized by a high degree of market volatility and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period.  The Company’s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in BRS products and services. New business efforts are dependent on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives in a manner consistent with their risk preferences and to deliver excellent client service. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain talented professionals is critical to the Company’s long-term success.     1    Table of Contents      FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS                                        Selected GAAP Financial Results    (in millions, except per share data)   2013     2012     2011     2010     2009     2008     5-YearCAGR(4)     Total revenue   $  10,180     $  9,337     $  9,081     $  8,612     $  4,700     $  5,064       15 %    Operating income   $ 3,857     $ 3,524     $ 3,249     $ 2,998     $ 1,278     $ 1,593       19 %    Operating margin     37.9 %      37.7 %      35.8 %      34.8 %      27.2 %      31.5 %      4 %    Nonoperating income (expense)(1)   $ 97     $ (36 )    $ (116 )    $ 36     $ (28 )    $ (422 )      (175 %)    Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc.   $ 2,932     $ 2,458     $ 2,337     $ 2,063     $ 875     $ 784       30 %    Diluted earnings per common share   $ 16.87     $ 13.79     $ 12.37     $ 10.55     $ 6.11     $ 5.78       24 %                                        Selected Non-GAAP Financial Results    (in millions, except per share data)   2013     2012     2011     2010     2009     2008     5-YearCAGR(4)     As adjusted(2):                                      Operating income   $  4,024     $  3,574     $  3,392     $  3,167     $  1,570     $  1,662       19 %    Operating margin(3)     41.4 %      40.4 %      39.7 %      39.3 %      38.2 %      38.7 %      1 %    Nonoperating income (expense)(1)   $ 7     $ (42 )    $ (113 )    $ 25     $ (46 )    $ (384 )      (145 %)    Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc.   $ 2,882     $ 2,438     $ 2,239     $ 2,139     $ 1,021     $ 856       27 %    Diluted earnings per common share   $ 16.58     $ 13.68     $ 11.85     $ 10.94     $ 7.13     $ 6.30       21 %       (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) (redeemable and nonredeemable).      (2) BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP reported results include certain significant items, the after-tax impact of which management deems nonrecurring, recurring infrequently or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value and, therefore, are excluded in calculating as adjusted results.        See reconciliation to GAAP measures in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures, for further information on as adjusted items for 2013, 2012 and 2011. Operating income, as adjusted, for 2009 excluded certain expenses incurred related to the integration of the acquisition of Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”), as well as advisory fees, legal fees and consulting transaction expenses related to the acquisition of BGI from Barclays on December 1, 2009 (the “BGI Transaction”), and restructuring charges. Operating income, as adjusted, for 2008 excluded restructuring charges. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded or to be funded through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution has also been excluded because these charges do not impact BlackRock’s book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded from operating and nonoperating income, as adjusted, as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense).      (3) Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Company’s results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contacts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue the Company earns. In addition, in 2008, revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excluded reimbursable property management compensation, which represented compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (“Metric”), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (“Realty”). Prior to the transfer in 2008 to a third party, these employees were retained on Metric’s payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realty’s clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realty’s clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they did not bear an economic cost to BlackRock.        Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted exclude the after-tax impact of the items listed above and also include the effect on deferred income tax expense attributable to changes in corporate income tax rates as a result of income tax law changes and a state tax election.

(“Claymore”) in March 2012, Credit Suisse’s ETF franchise (“Credit Suisse ETF Transaction”) in July 2013, MGPA in October 2013 and other reclassifications to conform to current period combined AUM policy and presentation. Amounts also include BGI merger-related outflows due to manager concentration considerations prior to the third quarter of 2011 and outflows from scientific active equity performance prior to the second quarter of 2011. As a result of client investment manager concentration limits and the scientific active equity performance, outflows were expected to occur for a period of time subsequent to the close of the transaction.    AUM represents the broad ranges of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for billing (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of non-discretionary advice, or assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis.  Investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of AUM. We also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, we also may earn securities lending fees. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary Aladdin® investment system as well as risk   management, outsourcing and advisory services, to institutional investors under the BRS name. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives.  At December 31, 2013, total AUM was $4.324 trillion, representing a CAGR of 27% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net new business and acquisitions, including BGI, which added approximately $1.844 trillion of AUM in December 2009, Claymore and SRPEP, which added $13.7 billion of AUM in 2012 and Credit Suisse and MGPA, which added $26.9 billion of AUM in 2013. These acquisitions significantly changed our AUM mix, from predominantly active fixed income and equity in 2008 to a broadly diversified product range, as described below.     The Company considers the categorization of its AUM by client type, product type, investment style and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company’s AUM will be organized as follows:            Client Type   Product Type   Client Region   ¨ Retail   ¨ Equity   ¨ Americas   ¨ iShares    ¨ Fixed Income   ¨ Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)   ¨ Institutional    ¨ Multi-asset   ¨ Asia-Pacific      ¨ Alternatives         ¨ Cash Management        3    Table of Contents       CLIENT TYPE  We serve a diverse mix of institutional and retail investors worldwide. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors; and retail investors. iShares is presented as a separate client type below, with investments in iShares by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections below.  Our organizational structure was designed to ensure that strong investment performance is our highest priority, and that we best align with our clients’ needs to capitalize on broader industry trends. Furthermore, our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent. Specifically, the client side of our business is organized into two groups: one comprising Retail and iShares and another comprising Institutional and BlackRock Solutions. The separation of the client functions into these two teams allows us to focus on the unique needs of these client groups by bringing the full capabilities of the firm to bear in an organized, cohesive approach. Additionally, our investments functions are split into five distinct strategies: Alpha, Beta, Multi-Asset, Alternatives and Trading/Liquidity.

(2) Amounts represent AUM acquired in the MGPA acquisition in October 2013.    BlackRock serves retail investors globally through separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. Retail investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Clients invest primarily in mutual funds, which totaled $402.2 billion, or 82%, of retail long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts (“SMAs”). The majority (94%) of long-term retail AUM is invested in active products, although this is impacted by the fact that iShares is shown separately. Retail represented 12% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2013 and 34% of long-term base fees for 2013.  The client base is also diversified geographically, with 70% of long-term AUM managed for investors based in the Americas, 24% in EMEA and 6% in Asia-Pacific at year-end 2013.        •   U.S. retail long-term net inflows of $21.3 billion, or 7% organic growth, were driven by flows into income products, with investors’ continued attraction to yield in          a low rate environment, and a growing appreciation for duration risk. Multi-asset class products led flows with $10.0 billion of net inflows, driven by demand for our flagship Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income funds. Fixed income net inflows of $9.4 billion reflected growing interest in unconstrained fixed income, with our Strategic Income Opportunities fund raising $6.9 billion. Our suite of six retail alternatives mutual funds continued to gain traction, raising $4.6 billion of net inflows, largely driven by our zero-duration liquid Global Long/Short Credit fund. This range of alternatives mutual funds now stands at $5.6 billion in AUM, and we are committed to broadening the distribution of alternatives funds to bring institutional-quality alternatives products to retail investors. Net inflows across multi-asset class, fixed income and alternatives were partially offset by equity net outflows of $2.8 billion, driven by historical performance-related redemptions from U.S. large cap equities, where we have implemented management changes to better meet our high performance standards. As of December 31, 2013, we are the leading U.S. manager by AUM of SMAs,     4    Table of Contents               the second largest closed-end fund manager and a top-ten manager by AUM and 2013 net flows of long-term open-end mutual funds1. In 2013, we were also the leading manager by net flows for long-dated fixed income mutual funds1.        •   We have fully integrated our legacy retail and iShares retail distribution teams to create a unified client-facing presence. As retail clients increasingly use BlackRock’s capabilities in combination — active, alternative and passive — it is a strategic priority for BlackRock to coherently deliver these capabilities through one integrated team.      •   International retail long-term net inflows of $17.5 billion, representing 15% organic growth, were positive across major regions and diversified across asset classes. Equity net inflows of $6.4 billion were driven by strong demand for our top-performing European Equities franchise as investor risk appetite for the sector improved. Multi-asset class and fixed income products each generated net inflows of $4.8 billion, as investors looked to manage duration and volatility in their portfolios. In 2013, we were ranked as the third largest cross border fund provider2. In the United Kingdom, we ranked among the five largest fund managers2.     iShares                                Component Changes in AUM — iShares    (in millions)   12/31/2012     Net NewBusiness     Acquisition(1)     Market / FX     12/31/2013     Equity   $ 534,648     $ 74,119     $ 13,021     $ 96,347     $ 718,135     Fixed income     192,852       (7,450 )      1,294       (7,861 )      178,835     Multi-asset class     869       355       —       86       1,310     Alternatives(2)     24,337       (3,053 )      1,645       (6,837 )      16,092     Total iShares   $  752,706     $  63,971     $  15,960     $  81,735     $  914,372        (1) Amounts represent $16.0 billion of AUM acquired in the Credit Suisse ETF acquisition in July 2013.      (2) Amounts include commodity iShares.    iShares is the leading ETF provider in the world, with $914.4 billion of AUM at December 31, 2013, and was the top asset gatherer globally in 20133 with $64.0 billion of net inflows for an organic growth rate of 8%. Equity net inflows of $74.1 billion were driven by flows into funds with broad developed market exposures, partially offset by outflows from emerging markets products. iShares fixed income experienced net outflows of $7.5 billion, as the continued low interest rate environment led many liquidity-oriented investors to sell long-duration assets, which made up the majority of the iShares fixed income suite. In 2013, we launched several funds to meet demand from clients seeking protection in a rising interest rate environment by offering an expanded product set that includes four new U.S. funds, including short-duration versions of our flagship high yield and investment grade credit products, and short maturity and liquidity income funds. iShares alternatives had $3.1 billion of net outflows predominantly out of commodities. iShares represented 23% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2013 and 35% of long-term base fees for 2013.  iShares offers the most diverse product set in the industry with 703 ETFs at year-end 2013, and serves the broadest client base, covering more than 25 countries on five continents. During 2013, iShares continued its dual commitment to innovation and responsible product structuring by introducing 42 new ETFs, acquiring Credit Suisse’s 58 ETFs in Europe and entering into a critical new strategic alliance with Fidelity Investments to deliver Fidelity’s more than 10 million clients increased access to   iShares products, tools and support. Our alliance with Fidelity Investments and a successful full first year for the Core Series have deeply expanded our presence and offerings among buy-and-hold investors. Our broad product range offers investors a precise, transparent and low-cost way to tap market returns and gain access to a full range of asset classes and global markets that have been difficult or expensive for many investors to access until now, as well as the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and cost-efficiently.        •   U.S. iShares AUM ended at $655.6 billion with $41.4 billion of net inflows driven by strong demand for developed markets equities and short-duration fixed income. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we debuted the Core Series in the United States, designed to provide the essential building blocks for buy-and-hold investors to use in constructing the core of their portfolio. The Core Series demonstrated solid results in its first full year, raising $20.0 billion in net inflows, primarily in U.S. equities. In the United States, iShares maintained its position as the largest ETF provider, with 39% share of AUM3.        •   International iShares AUM ended at $258.8 billion with robust net new business of $22.6 billion led by demand for European and Japanese equities, as well as a diverse range of fixed income products. At year-end 2013, iShares was the largest European ETF provider with 48% of AUM3.         1 Simfund      2 Lipper FERI      3 BlackRock; Bloomberg    5    Table of Contents      Institutional Investors                                    Component Changes in AUM – Institutional    (in millions)   12/31/2012     Net NewBusiness     Adjustments(1)     Acquisition(2)     Market / FX     12/31/2013     Active:                                 Equity   $ 129,024     $  (16,504 )    $ —     $ —     $ 26,206     $ 138,726     Fixed income     518,102       (3,560 )      —       —       (9,433 )      505,109     Multi-asset class     166,708       28,955       3,335       —       16,278       215,276     Alternatives     70,861       (9,819 )      —       10,836       1,421       73,299     Active subtotal     884,695       (928 )      3,335       10,836       34,472       932,410     Non-ETF Index:                                 Equity     1,017,081       8,001       (18,238 )      —       250,955       1,257,799     Fixed income     409,943       8,321       (4,723 )      —       (6,774 )      406,767     Multi-asset class     9,545       (1,833 )      —       —       (138 )      7,574     Alternatives     4,912       777       —       —       (179 )      5,510     Non-ETF Index subtotal     1,441,481       15,266       (22,961 )      —       243,864       1,677,650     Long-term institutional   $  2,326,176     $ 14,338     $  (19,626 )    $  10,836     $  278,336     $  2,610,060        (1) Amounts include $19.6 billion of AUM related to fund ranges reclassed from institutional to retail and $6.0 billion of AUM reclassed from non-ETF index equity and fixed income to multi-asset.      (2) Amounts represent AUM acquired in the MGPA acquisition in October 2013.    BlackRock’s institutional AUM is well diversified by both product and region, and we serve institutional investors on six continents in sub-categories including: pensions, endowments and foundations, official institutions, and financial institutions, as described below.  Institutional active AUM ended the quarter at $932.4 billion, up $47.7 billion, or 5%, since year-end 2012. Institutional active represented 23% of long-term AUM and 21% of long-term base fees. Growth in AUM reflected continued strength in multi-asset class products with net inflows of $29.0 billion largely from defined contribution plans into target date offerings. Multi-asset class net inflows were offset by equity net outflows of $16.5 billion, with 70% of outflows coming from fundamental strategies, and fixed income net outflows of $3.6 billion, largely from U.S. intermediate duration mandates. Alternatives net outflows of $9.8 billion were primarily due to active currency redemptions of $6.5 billion and return of capital on opportunistic funds of $2.5 billion.  Institutional non-ETF index AUM totaled $1.678 trillion at December 31, 2013, reflecting net inflows of $15.3 billion. Flows were led by fixed income with net inflows of $8.3 billion, primarily into local currency, U.S. targeted duration and global bond mandates as clients rebalanced portfolios and captured gains in equity markets. Equities saw net inflows of $8.0 billion, primarily into global mandates, as clients increasingly looked to use passive vehicles for broad macro exposure. Institutional non-ETF index represented 42% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2013 and accounted for 10% of long-term base fees for 2013.  The Company’s institutional clients consist of the following:        •   Pensions, Foundations and Endowments. BlackRock is among the largest managers of pension plan assets in the world with $1.718 trillion, or 66%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2013.          Retirement is a key theme as longevity, aging populations and changing demographics worldwide are driving investment decisions. The market landscape is shifting from defined benefit to defined contribution, driving strong flows in our defined contribution channel, which had $30.0 billion of long-term net inflows for the year, or 7% organic growth. Defined contribution net inflows were led by $20.5 billion into multi-asset class products, with our LifePath® target-date suite serving as a key component of our retirement solutions. In 2013, our LifePath franchise raised $23.9 billion in net inflows, a 38% organic growth rate. We ended 2013 with $526.4 billion in defined contribution AUM, and remain well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $59.9 billion, or 3% of long-term institutional AUM, was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments.        •   Official Institutions. We also managed $221.5 billion, or 8%, of long-term institutional AUM, for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2013. This specialty client group grew with long-term net new business of $22.7 billion for the year, primarily into passive equity mandates. These clients often require specialized investment policy advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.        •   Financial and Other Institutions. BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $237.3 billion, or 9%, of institutional long-term AUM at year-end 2013, and contributed $5.7 billion of long-term net inflows. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which we provide sub-advisory services, totaled $373.3 billion, or 14%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.     6    Table of Contents      PRODUCT TYPE  Component changes in AUM by product type and investment style for 2013 are presented below.

(2) Amounts represent $16.0 billion of AUM acquired in the Credit Suisse ETF acquisition in July 2013 and $11.0 billion of AUM acquired in the MGPA acquisition in October 2013.    Long-term product offerings include active and passive strategies. Our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile. We offer two types of active strategies: those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, passive strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Passive strategies include both our institutional non-ETF index products and iShares ETFs.  Although many clients use both active and passive strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. This has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.  Equity  Year-end 2013 equity AUM of $2.318 trillion increased by $472.2 billion, or 26%, from the end of 2012, largely due to flows into U.S. and a range of international equity mandates reflecting investors’ increased risk appetite and the effect of higher market valuations. Equity AUM growth included $69.3 billion in net new business and $13.0 billion in new   assets related to the Credit Suisse ETF acquisition in July 2013. Net new business of $69.3 billion was driven by net inflows of $74.1 billion and $10.5 billion into iShares and non-ETF index accounts, respectively. Passive inflows were offset by active net outflows of $15.4 billion, with net outflows of $9.9 billion and $5.5 billion from fundamental and scientific active equity products, respectively.  BlackRock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock’s equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than similar U.S. equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which do not consistently move in tandem with U.S. markets, may have a greater impact on BlackRock’s effective equity fee rates and revenues.  Fixed Income  Fixed income AUM ended 2013 at $1.242 trillion, declining $17.1 billion, or 1%, relative to December 31, 2012. The decline in AUM reflected $29.1 billion in market and foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $11.5 billion in net new business and $1.3 billion in new assets related to the Credit Suisse ETF acquisition. In 2013, net new business was led by strong flows into unconstrained fixed income offerings, such as our Strategic Income Opportunities fund, which had net inflows of $6.9 billion during the year, despite overall industry outflows from U.S. bond funds. Fixed income net inflows of $14.8 billion and $8.5 billion into fundamental and non-ETF index products, respectively, were partially offset by net outflows of $7.5 billion and $4.3 billion from iShares and model based strategies, respectively.     7    Table of Contents      Multi-Asset Class                                Component Changes in Multi-Asset Class AUM    (in millions)   12/31/2012     Net NewBusiness     Adjustments(1)     Market / FX     12/31/2013     Asset allocation and balanced   $ 140,160     $ 15,904     $ —     $ 13,540     $ 169,604     Target date/risk     69,884       26,073       5,998       9,453       111,408     Fiduciary     57,704       321       —       2,177       60,202     Multi-asset   $  267,748     $  42,298     $  5,998     $  25,170     $  341,214        (1) Amounts include $6.0 billion of AUM reclassed from non-ETF index equity and fixed income to multi-asset.    BlackRock’s multi-asset class team manages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, currencies, bonds and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.  Flows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $27.1 billion, or 64%, of net inflows coming from institutional clients. Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows, and contributed $20.5 billion to institutional multi-asset class net new business in 2013, primarily into target date and target risk product offerings. Retail net inflows of $14.8 billion were driven by particular demand for our Global Allocation suite, which saw $6.3 billion of net inflows, and our Multi-Asset Income fund which raised $4.1 billion in 2013.  The Company’s multi-asset strategies include the following:        •   Asset allocation and balanced products represented 50% of multi-asset class AUM at year-end, with growth in AUM driven by net new business of $15.9 billion. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to        minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flagship products in this category include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income suites.        •   Target date and target risk products grew 37% organically in 2013. Institutional investors represented 90% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans accounting for over 80% of AUM. The remaining 10% of target date and target risk AUM consisted of retail client investments. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our LifePath and LifePath Retirement Income® offerings, and included $10.4 billion of assets related to two large LifePath open-architecture assignments where we provide customized asset allocation glidepaths, direct asset management and model the use of third-party managers. LifePath products utilize a proprietary asset allocation model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s expected retirement timing.        •   Fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of plan management. These customized services require strong partnership with the clients’ investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives.

The BlackRock Alternative Investors (“BAI”) group coordinates our alternative investment efforts, including product management, business development and client service. Our alternatives products fall into two main categories — core and currency and commodities. Core includes hedge funds, funds of funds (hedge funds and private equity), real estate and hard asset offerings. The products offered under the BAI umbrella are described below.  We continued to make significant investments in our alternatives platform as demonstrated by our acquisition of MGPA, which doubled the size of our real estate investment advisory platform in addition to extending our real estate debt and equity investment capabilities to Asia-Pacific and Europe, and the build out of our alternatives retail platform, which now stands at $16.2 billion in AUM. We believe that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt     8    Table of Contents        their asset allocation strategies to best meet their investment objectives, they will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings, and as a top 10 alternative provider4 our highly diversified $111.1 billion alternatives franchise is well positioned to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors.  Core.        •   Hedge Funds net inflows of $4.4 billion were led by net inflows of $5.9 billion into single-strategy hedge funds. Single-strategy net inflows were driven by net inflows of $4.6 billion into retail alternative mutual funds, paced by our zero-duration liquid Global Long/Short Credit fund. Single-strategy net inflows were offset by return of capital of $2.5 billion on opportunistic funds, largely due to a partial liquidation of an opportunistic 2007 vintage closed-end mortgage fund. Hedge fund AUM includes a variety of single-strategy, multi-strategy, and global macro, as well as portable alpha, distressed and opportunistic offerings. Products include both open-end hedge funds and similar products, and closed-end funds created to take advantage of specific opportunities over a defined, often longer-term investment horizon.        •   Funds of Funds AUM included $16.9 billion in funds of hedge funds and hybrid vehicles and $11.9 billion in private equity funds of funds. Net outflows of $1.4 billion were predominantly from funds of hedge funds.        •   Real Estate and Hard Assets AUM grew 90% compared to year-end 2012, primarily due to $11.0 billion in new assets from the acquisition of MGPA. Offerings include high yield debt and core, value-added and opportunistic equity portfolios and renewable power funds. We continued to grow our real estate platform and product offerings with the acquisition of MGPA.    During 2013, we secured $6 billion of alternatives commitments in offerings including infrastructure, strategic credit and funds of funds. The majority of these commitments are unfunded and are expected to be deployed in future quarters.  Currency and Commodities. AUM in currency and commodities declined 37% compared to year-end 2012, reflecting net outflows of $8.7 billion, primarily from low fee active currency mandates. Currency and commodities products include a range of active and passive products. Our iShares commodities products represented $16.1 billion of AUM, including $1.6 billion acquired from Credit Suisse, and are not eligible for performance fees.  Cash Management  Cash management AUM totaled $275.6 billion at December 31, 2013, of which $114.7 billion was in prime strategies, up $11.8 billion, or 4%, from year-end 2012. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios are denominated in U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Euro or British pound. We generated net inflows of $10.1 billion during 2013, and continue to face headwinds around the uncertainty of future regulatory changes and a near zero interest rate environment. We provided new solutions and choices for our clients by launching ultra-short duration products in the United States, which address the immediate challenge of a continuing low interest rate environment as well as provide valuable investment alternatives in the wake of money market fund regulatory change. In Europe, we launched a non-rated Euro liquidity fund. Further, some existing products were re-structured with features to address negative yields, should they occur.

Americas. Net new business in long-term products of $72.1 billion was driven by equity and multi-asset class net inflows of $53.3 billion and $36.1 billion, respectively, which were partially offset by fixed income and alternatives net outflows of $13.0 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. During the year, we served clients through offices in 33 states in the United States as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Spain.  EMEA. During the year, clients awarded us long-term net new business of $41.3 billion, including inflows from investors in 22 countries across the region. EMEA net new business was led by equity net inflows of $20.1 billion as clients began to re-risk in the face of improving confidence in European markets. Our offerings include fund families in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Dublin and iShares listed on stock exchanges throughout Europe as well as separate accounts and pooled investment products.  Asia-Pacific. Clients in the Asia-Pacific region are served through offices in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea, and joint ventures in China and India. Long-term net new business of $3.8 billion was led by fixed income and multi-asset class net inflows of $8.7 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, partially offset by equity and alternatives net outflows of $4.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.

BLACKROCK SOLUTIONS  BlackRock Solutions offers investment management technology systems, risk management services and advisory services on a fee basis. Aladdin is our proprietary technology platform, which serves as the risk management system for both BlackRock and a growing number of sophisticated institutional investors around the world. BRS also offers comprehensive risk reporting capabilities via the Green Package® and risk management advisory services; interactive fixed income analytics through our web-based calculator, AnSer®; middle and back office outsourcing services; and investment accounting. BRS’ Financial Markets Advisory (“FMA”) group provides services such as valuation and risk assessment of illiquid assets, portfolio restructuring, workouts and dispositions of distressed assets and financial and balance sheet strategies, for a wide range of global clients.  BlackRock Solutions record revenues of $577 million were up 11% year over year. Our Aladdin business, which represented 73% of BRS revenue for the year, signed more than 15 new clients in 2013, and continues to benefit from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. Aladdin business assignments are typically long-term contracts that provide significant recurring revenue.  Our FMA group signed more than 50 new assignments during the year and continued to post strong revenues, even as the business transitions from a “crisis management” emphasis to a more institutionalized advisory business model, with a strong focus on helping clients navigate and implement requirements for the new regulatory environment. Advisory AUM decreased 20% to $36.3 billion, driven by $7.4 billion of planned client distributions reflecting our continued success in disposing of assets for clients at, or above, targeted levels.  At year-end, BRS served clients, including banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers and other institutional investors across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.     10    Table of Contents       SECURITIES LENDING  Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. The cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending can be structured as a share of earnings and/or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned is captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.  Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $156 billion, up from $134 billion at year-end 2012. Liability spreads declined from elevated 2012 levels, as the proportion of “special collateral,” securities commanding premium lending fees, declined due to low idiosyncratic risk, low single stock volatility and lack of M&A activity.  BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation/reporting of the profile of the portfolios identifies that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived, such temporary waivers are infrequent.  RISK & QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS  Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk & Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and operational risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics.  COMPETITION  BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must   be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, investment style and discipline, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service. These factors may place BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the Company’s strategies and efforts to maintain its existing AUM and to attract new business will be successful.  GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION  At December 31, 2013, BlackRock served clients in more than 100 countries across the globe, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan.

EMPLOYEES  At December 31, 2013, BlackRock had a total of approximately 11,400 employees, including approximately 5,400 located in offices outside the United States. Consistent with our commitment to continually expand and enhance our talent base to support our clients, we added approximately 900 employees during the year, including in strategic focus areas.  REGULATION  Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations both in and outside the United     11    Table of Contents        States, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, trust customers of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”), PNC and its bank subsidiaries and their customers, and the financial system. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and bank holding companies and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines both for individuals and the Company. The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.  REGULATORY REFORM  In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “DFA”) was signed into law in the United States. The DFA is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be fully implemented. The continued adoption of these regulations and decisions will in large measure determine the impact of the DFA on BlackRock and other financial services firms. The DFA may significantly change BlackRock’s operating environment and the financial markets in general in unpredictable ways. It is not possible to predict the ultimate effects that the DFA, or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions, will have upon BlackRock’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Among the potential impacts, provisions of the DFA referred to as the Volcker Rule will affect the extent to which BlackRock invests in and transacts with certain of its investment funds, including private equity funds, hedge funds and funds of funds. The impact of the Volcker Rule on liquidity and pricing in the broader financial markets is unknown at this time. For a further discussion of the Volcker Rule, see “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Legal and Regulatory Risks.” In addition, BlackRock could be designated a systemically important financial institution (“SIFI”) and become subject to direct supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). If BlackRock were designated a SIFI, it could be subject to enhanced prudential, supervisory and other requirements, such as risk-based capital requirements; leverage limits; liquidity requirements; resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements; concentration limits; a contingent capital requirement; enhanced public disclosures; short-term debt limits; and overall risk management requirements. Further, new regulations under the DFA relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives will impact the manner by which BlackRock-advised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives, and may significantly increase the costs of derivatives trading. Similarly, BlackRock’s management of funds and accounts that use and trade swaps and derivatives could be adversely impacted by recently adopted changes to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (the “CFTC”) regulations. These rule changes   include those concerning, among other things, the registration and regulation of commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors (and the accompanying registration and regulation of such entities by the National Futures Association (the “NFA”)), the registration status of dealer counterparties and other counterparties who are major participants in the swap markets, and requirements concerning mandatory clearing of certain swap transactions. Jurisdictions outside the United States in which BlackRock operates are also in the process of devising or considering more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could have a similar impact on BlackRock and the broader markets.  The DFA and its regulations, and other new laws or regulations, or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities; require BlackRock to change certain business practices; divert management’s time and attention from BlackRock’s business activities to compliance activities; and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and tax costs) and liabilities, as well as reputational harm. For example, in addition to regulatory changes mandated by the DFA, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) continues to review the role of and risks related to, money market funds and has indicated that it may adopt additional regulations. Some of the proposed changes, if adopted, could significantly alter money market fund products and the entire money market fund industry. In 2012, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States (the “OCC”) amended the regulations governing bank-maintained short-term investment funds (“STIFs”) to include new disclosure requirements regarding portfolio holdings and to more closely align portfolio limitations, such as maximum weighted average maturity and weighted average life, with those applicable to SEC registered money market funds. Similarly, the SEC continues to review the distribution fees paid to mutual fund distributors under Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”), which are important to a number of the mutual funds BlackRock manages. Any changes to 12b-1 fees would alter the way BlackRock’s distribution partners distribute BlackRock products. Additionally, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the CFTC each continue to review the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds, and such reviews could result in regulations that further limit the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds. If adopted, these limitations could require BlackRock to change certain mutual fund business practices or to register additional entities with the CFTC, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions. In addition, BlackRock has begun reporting certain information about a number of its private funds to the SEC and certain information about a number of its commodity pools to the CFTC, pursuant to systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by both agencies, which have required, and will continue to require, investments in people and systems to assure timely and accurate reporting. Still another example of changes in the regulatory landscape was the IRS’ implementation of Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”). FATCA was enacted in 2010 and is intended to address tax compliance issues associated with U.S. taxpayers with foreign accounts. FATCA requires foreign financial institutions to report to the IRS information about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers and imposes withholding, documentation and reporting requirements on foreign financial institutions. Final     12    Table of Contents        regulations were issued by the IRS on January 17, 2013, with the earliest effective dates beginning on July 1, 2014. In many instances, however, the precise nature of what needs to be implemented will be governed by bilateral Intergovernmental Agreements (“IGAs”) between the United States and the countries in which BlackRock does business. While many of these IGAs have been put into place, others have yet to be concluded. FATCA could cause the Company to incur significant administrative and compliance costs and subject clients to U.S. tax withholding.  An example of changes in the regulatory landscape in Europe is the European Union (“EU”) Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), which became effective on July 21, 2011 and was required to be implemented by EU member states by July 22, 2013. The AIFMD regulates managers of, and service providers to, a broad range of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) domiciled within and (depending on the precise circumstances) outside the EU. The AIFMD also regulates the marketing of all AIFs inside the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). In general, the AIFMD will have a staged implementation between mid-2013 and 2018. Compliance with the AIFMD’s requirements will restrict AIF marketing and will place additional compliance and disclosure obligations regarding remuneration, capital requirements, leverage, valuation, stakes in EU companies, depositaries, the domicile of custodians and liquidity management.  Globally, regulators are examining the potential risks in ETFs and may impose additional regulations on ETFs, including requirements to promote increased transparency and to limit the ability of ETFs to utilize derivatives. The International Organization of Securities Commissions published principles for regulatory oversight of financial benchmarks in 2013, with standards applying to methodologies for benchmark calculation, and transparency and governance issues in the benchmarking process; some national and regional regulators are currently reviewing how to apply these principles, with a draft European Regulation published in September 2013. Any of these regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions, could materially and adversely impact the value of assets in which BlackRock has invested directly and/or on behalf of clients, and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms, could make it more difficult for BlackRock to conduct certain businesses or distinguish itself from competitors.  Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by regulators and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of BlackRock. BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce. See the “— Non-U.S. Regulation” section below for a further discussion of regulatory reforms being considered and/or adopted outside of the United States.  U.S. REGULATION  BlackRock and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries are subject to regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the Department of Labor (the “DOL”), the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”),   the NFA, the CFTC and other government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain of BlackRock’s U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering regulations and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies.  The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.  BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as well as the rules of various U.S. and non-U.S. securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations, reporting obligations) and market regulation policies in the United States and globally. Depending on the scope of the rules to be adopted by the SEC, provisions added to the Exchange Act by the DFA may require certain BlackRock subsidiaries to register as municipal advisors in relation to their services for state and local governments, pension plans and other investment programs, such as college savings plans. In addition, BlackRock manages a variety of investment funds listed on U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges, which are subject to the rules of such exchanges. Violation of these laws and regulations could result in restrictions on the Company’s activities and damage its reputation.  BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, CDOs, real estate funds, collective investment trusts, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators.  Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are     13    Table of Contents        fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require BlackRock to carry bonds ensuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to non-benefit plan clients.  BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. Additional BlackRock entities may need to register as a CPO or commodity trading advisor as a result of recently enacted regulatory changes by the CFTC. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of the DFA, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Two of BlackRock’s other subsidiaries, BlackRock Investments, LLC (“BRIL”) and BlackRock Execution Services, are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. BRIL is also an approved person with the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and a member of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) subject to MSRB rules.  U.S. BANKING REGULATION  PNC is a bank holding company and regulated as a “financial holding company” by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”). As described in “Item 1-Business”, PNC owns approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock. Based on the Federal Reserve’s current interpretation of the BHC Act, this ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a non-bank subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act and therefore subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve and to most banking laws, regulations and orders that apply to PNC, including the Volcker Rule. The supervision and regulation of PNC and its subsidiaries under applicable banking laws is intended primarily for the protection of its banking subsidiaries, its depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the financial system as a whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders, creditors or clients of PNC or BlackRock. PNC’s relationships and good standing with its regulators are important to the conduct of BlackRock’s business. BlackRock may also be subject to foreign banking laws and supervision that could affect its business.  BTC is a limited purpose national trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as capital adequacy, regulations governing fiduciaries, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. BTC is also subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC’s customers and not BTC, BlackRock and its affiliates, or BlackRock’s stockholders.  BlackRock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a financial holding company under the BHC Act. Investment management is an authorized activity, but must be conducted within applicable regulatory requirements, which in some cases are more restrictive than those BlackRock faces under applicable securities laws. BlackRock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory, administrative or other services, only to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations. The Federal Reserve has broad powers to approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for BlackRock to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations. There are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of PNC to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with BlackRock or its funds. PNC and its subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of BlackRock’s businesses.  The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit BlackRock from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting BlackRock’s business. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws, regulations and orders. The DFA strengthened the Federal Reserve’s supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding company’s non-bank affiliates, such as BlackRock.  Any failure of PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. Such a change of status could be caused by any failure of PNC or one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed,” by any examination downgrade of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act.  NON-U.S. REGULATION  BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and bodies and, in certain cases, are affected by U.S. laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application. As BlackRock continues to expand its international presence, a number of its subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory frameworks comparable to those affecting its operations in the United States.  The Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, and branches of its U.K. regulated entities in the EU, and the Prudential Regulation Authority (the “PRA”) also regulates one BlackRock subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FCA and/or the PRA is required to conduct any financial services related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FCA’s rules made under that Act govern a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements,     14    Table of Contents        conduct of business, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements imposed on firms. The FCA supervises the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic based reviews — in order to monitor the Company’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees.  In addition to the above, the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches, must comply with the pan-European regulatory regime established by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”), which became effective on November 1, 2007 and regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the EEA, as well as the Capital Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital requirements. Revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms apply as of January 1, 2014. These include requirements not only on capital, but address matters of governance and remuneration as well. These will have a direct effect on some of BlackRock’s European operations. MiFID sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements.  The United Kingdom has adopted the MiFID rules into national legislation and FCA regulations, as have those other European jurisdictions in which BlackRock has a presence (excluding Switzerland which is not part of the EU or EEA). A review of MiFID by the European Commission has led to the publication of a draft amended Directive and a draft new Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation. The proposals, which are currently being finalized, are likely to result in changes to pre- and post-trade reporting obligations and an expansion of the types of instruments subject to these requirements. They may affect the buying and selling of derivatives by moving most derivative trading onto regulated trading venues and may control the activities of algorithmic trading. The proposals may also result in changes to conduct of business requirements including selling practices, intermediary inducements and client categorization. The proposals also envisage giving the European Commission power to ban certain products and services. A further EU regulation, Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, was adopted in August 2012, and requires (i) the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts from February 2014.  In addition, the FCA will introduce rules in April 2014 that ban payments by product providers to distribution platforms for both advised and non-advised business. These rules follow on from the retail distribution review that came into effect in December 2012 and changed how retail clients pay for investment advice. The FCA also has proposed a prohibition on the use of dealing commissions to pay for corporate access. Final rules are expected to be issued in mid-2014 along with a discussion paper on the broader use of dealing commissions.  In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European Commission set out a detailed plan for EU financial reform, outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives, regulations and recommendations of which the MiFID review (mentioned above) was a part. These, together with the changes contemplated by the AIFMD (mentioned above), will have direct and indirect effects on BlackRock’s operations in the EEA.  The European Commission has also published proposals to replace the Market Abuse Directive with a regulation on insider dealing and market manipulation and with an accompanying directive on criminal sanctions. The Regulation has now been largely agreed, but an implementation date remains outstanding as it will be linked to the commencement of the revised MiFID rules.  The next iteration of the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (“UCITS IV”), was required to be adopted in the national law of each EU member state by July 1, 2011. The United Kingdom has adopted UCITS IV requirements into national legislation and FCA regulation. Luxembourg and Ireland have also adopted UCITS IV into their national legislation. However, several other EU member states are still in various stages of the adoption process. UCITS IV introduced new requirements including a requirement on UCITS funds to provide a key investor information document. Recent European Commission consultations have addressed retail investor protection issues, including UCITS V, which considers, among other items, custodial liability, and UCITS VI, which includes proposals on depositaries and product management. A separate proposed regulation on money market funds has also been published and would, if adopted, have a significant impact on BlackRock’s European money market fund offerings.  Proposals on packaged retail investment products (“PRIPs”) are to be implemented through the strengthening of MiFID standards (for non-insurance PRIPs), revisions to the Insurance Mediation Directive’s selling standard (for all insurance-based PRIPs) and new investor disclosure requirements for all PRIPs though a separate EU legislative process.  The European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) has published guidelines on ETFs and other UCITS issues in February 2013, which introduce new collateral management requirements for UCITS concerning collateral received in the context of derivatives using Efficient Portfolio Management techniques and OTC derivative transactions. These rules will require significant changes and implementation is due by February 2014.  Certain individual EU Member States, such as France and Italy, have enacted national financial transaction taxes (“FTTs”), and a group of Member States also could adopt a FTT under an EU Enhanced Cooperation procedure that would apply in those Member States. In general, any tax on securities and derivatives transactions would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity of the securities and derivatives markets, could diminish the attractiveness of certain types of products that we manage in those countries and could cause clients to shift assets away from such products. A FTT could significantly increase the operational costs of our entering into, on behalf of our clients, securities and derivatives transactions that would be subjected to a FTT, which would adversely impact our revenues.  For the insurance sector, the Solvency II process will increase the amount of capital that insurers will have to set     15    Table of Contents        aside and will have an indirect effect on fund managers with insurance clients. The Solvency II process has been delayed from an original compliance date of January 1, 2014 but agreement has now been confirmed for implementation on January 1, 2016.  In addition to the FCA, the activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are overseen by financial services regulators in Germany, The Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Isle of Man, Jersey, France, Belgium, Italy, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. Regulators in these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements. Other BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are regulated in Japan, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Dubai, Cayman Islands, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Canada.  In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the “FIEL”) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL.  In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”). ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. Failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the regulated subsidiaries licenses in Australia.  The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the “SFO”) which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the “SFC”). The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time. Failure to comply with the applicable laws, regulations, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC could result in the suspension or revocations of the licenses granted by the SFC.  There are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries are authorized to conduct business. Among the various international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company.

Item 1A. Risk Factors  As a leading investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock’s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating and compliance risks, BlackRock’s business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.  MARKET AND EXTERNAL RISKS  Changes in the value levels of the capital, commodities or currency markets or other asset classes could adversely impact revenues and earnings.  BlackRock’s investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of assets under management (“AUM”) and, in some cases, performance fees normally expressed as a percentage of the returns in excess of a benchmark. Numerous factors, including movements in equity, debt, commodity, real estate and alternative investment asset prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates could cause:        •   the value of AUM to decrease;        •   the returns realized on AUM to decrease;        •   clients to withdraw funds in favor of products that they perceive offer greater opportunity than BlackRock’s products;     16    Table of Contents           •   clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that it may not manage;        •   clients to rebalance assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees; and        •   an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill.  The occurrence of any of these events could result in lower investment advisory, management, administration and performance fees and cause the Company’s revenues and earnings to decline.  Competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins.  The investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. To the extent that BlackRock is forced to compete on the basis of price, fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause revenues and profit margins to decline.  Failure of other financial institutions could adversely affect BlackRock’s earnings.  The products and accounts that BlackRock manages have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and BlackRock routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose BlackRock’s products and accounts to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty. While BlackRock regularly assesses risks posed by these counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform. Such a failure could negatively impact the performance of BlackRock’s products and accounts, which could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.  The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to reduced AUM in similar products of BlackRock without regard to the performance of BlackRock’s products.  The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products of BlackRock without regard to the performance of BlackRock’s products. Such a negative perception could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on the Company’s AUM, revenues and earnings.  BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.  Separate account and commingled trust clients may terminate their investment management contracts with BlackRock or withdraw funds on short notice. The Company experiences routine turnover in commingled trust funds and separate accounts and could, in the future, lose significant AUM in funds and accounts due to various circumstances such as adverse market conditions, fee competition or poor performance.  Additionally, BlackRock manages its U.S. mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds’ boards of directors annually and may be terminated by them without cause on short notice. Certain additional services, such as securities lending, also require approval by the funds’ boards of directors annually. A majority of the directors of each such fund are independent from BlackRock. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund managed by the Company will not terminate BlackRock or will approve the fund’s management contract each year or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to the Company.  Further, the governing agreements of many of the Company’s private investment funds generally provide that, subject to certain conditions, investors in those funds, and in some cases independent directors of those funds, may remove BlackRock as the investment adviser, general partner or the equivalent of the fund or liquidate the fund without cause by a simple majority vote, resulting in a reduction in the management or performance fees as well as the total carried interest BlackRock could earn.  Operating in international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, regulatory and other risks.  As a result of BlackRock’s extensive international business activities, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational and foreign exchange rate risks. The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support such international activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which could cause the Company’s earnings to decline.  RISKS RELATED TO BLACKROCK’S BUSINESS AND INTERNAL OPERATIONS  Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues and earnings.  The Company’s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors could reduce revenues and cause earnings to decline as a result of:        •   existing clients withdrawing funds in favor of better performing products, which could result in lower investment advisory and administration fees;        •   the diminishing ability to attract funds from existing and new clients;        •   the Company earning minimal or no performance fees; and        •   an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill.  Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.  A portion of BlackRock’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments. Performance fees represented     17    Table of Contents        $561 million, or 6%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013. In most cases, performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns, although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards. Generally, the Company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, performance fees for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods.  Changes in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns could affect BlackRock’s nonoperating income or earnings and could increase the volatility of its earnings.  At December 31, 2013, BlackRock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately $1.6 billion in its investments (see “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments”) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. A decline in the prices of equity or debt securities, or the value of real estate or other alternative investments could lower the value of these investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock’s earnings and, if such prices decline or BlackRock realizes losses, could result in a decline in earnings.  Additionally, the Company may generate realized and unrealized capital losses on such seed investments and co-investments. U.S. Federal realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes. The Company has unrealized capital losses for which a deferred tax asset has been established. In the event such unrealized losses are realized, the Company may not be able to offset such losses within the carryback or carryforward period or from future realized capital gains, in which case the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The failure to utilize the deferred tax asset could materially increase BlackRock’s income tax expense.  Failure to maintain adequate infrastructure and a technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.  The Company’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers, and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. The failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of its business, including any expansion, or the outage or failure of existing infrastructure, could materially impact operations and impede the Company’s productivity and growth, which could cause the Company’s earnings to decline or could impact the Company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to regulatory fines and sanctions.  A key element to BlackRock’s continued success is the ability to maintain a technological advantage in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into BlackRock’s Aladdin technology platform that support investment advisory and BRS clients. Moreover, the Company’s technological and software advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide various types of data and software. The failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties   and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and BRS clients. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes.  Failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in BlackRock’s earnings.  BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of its information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information and could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, could cause a decline in the Company’s earnings.  Failure to maintain adequate business continuity plans could have a material adverse impact on BlackRock and its products.  A significant portion of BlackRock’s critical business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas, including San Francisco, California, New York, New York and London, England. A major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act or other catastrophic event in any of these locations could result in disruption to the business. The failure of the Company to maintain updated adequate business continuity plans, including secure backup facilities, systems and personnel could impede the Company’s ability to operate during, or could effect, a disruption, which could cause the Company’s earnings to decline.  Failure to maintain adequate liquidity for general business operations could adversely impact BlackRock’s financial condition and growth prospects.  BlackRock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its ability to maintain and grow AUM, its creditworthiness and operating cash flows. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock’s access to capital markets and its ability to issue public or private debt on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings as well as changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing could adversely impact BlackRock’s financial condition and prospects for growth.  Failure to comply with client contractual requirements and/or guidelines could result in damage awards against BlackRock and loss of revenues due to client terminations.  When clients retain BlackRock to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf, they typically specify guidelines or contractual requirements that the Company is required to observe in the provision of its services. A failure     18    Table of Contents        to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to BlackRock’s reputation or in its clients seeking to recover losses, withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts, any of which could cause the Company’s AUM, revenues and earnings to decline.  Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely impact product performance and client relationships.  BlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment decisions and allocations, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on BlackRock’s business and reputation.  The determination to provide support to particular products from time to time may reduce earnings or other investments in the business.  BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time support investment products through capital or credit support or indemnifications. Such support and indemnifications utilize capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses or prohibitions on such support and indemnifications, or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products, could have an adverse impact on revenues and earnings.  Failure to manage risks in operating BlackRock’s securities lending program for clients could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues and liquidity.  On behalf of certain clients, BlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage risks associated with (i) ensuring that the value of the collateral held against the securities on loan does not decline in value or become illiquid and that its nature and value complies with regulatory requirements and investment requirements; (ii) the potential that a borrower defaults or does not return a loaned security on a timely basis; and (iii) errors in the settlement of securities, daily mark-to-market valuations and collateral collection. The failure of the Company’s controls to mitigate these risks could result in financial losses for the Company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs as well as for the Company.  The determination to provide securities lending indemnifications may reduce earnings or other investments in the business.  BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of a potential default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligations under the securities lending agreement. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall, and do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2013 and subject to   indemnification was $118.3 billion. BlackRock held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $124.6 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2013. BlackRock expects indemnified balances to continue to increase over time. The failure of the Company to mitigate these risks could result in financial losses for the Company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs as well as for the Company.  Failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies, or fraud, or the circumvention of controls and policies, could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation and financial position.  Although BlackRock has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks, it cannot assure that such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to its businesses. BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud or act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company’s controls, policies and procedures. Persistent or repeated attempts involving fraud, conflicts of interests or circumvention of policies and controls could have a materially adverse impact on BlackRock’s reputation and could lead to costly regulatory inquiries.  Additional acquisitions may decrease earnings and harm the Company’s competitive position if not successful.  BlackRock employs a variety of strategies intended to enhance earnings and expand product offerings in order to improve profit margins. These strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, acquisitions of investment management businesses, such as MGPA and Credit Suisse’s ETF franchise, and other small and medium-sized strategic acquisitions to expand geographical reach, access new clients or pursue other business and financial opportunities. These strategies may not be effective, and failure to successfully develop and implement these strategies may decrease earnings and harm certain aspects of the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry. These strategic transactions also involve a number of financial accounting, tax, regulatory and operational challenges and uncertainties, including the assumption of pre-existing liabilities, and failure to identify and mitigate associated risks through due diligence and indemnification provisions could adversely impact BlackRock’s earnings and reputation. In the event BlackRock pursues additional acquisitions, it may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices, and it may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from such acquisitions.  The development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to additional costs or operational risk.   BlackRock’s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to develop, market and manage new investment products and services. The development and introduction of new products and services may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the     19    Table of Contents        introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. Failure to successfully manage these risks may cause BlackRock’s revenues and costs to fluctuate and could have an adverse impact on its business and reputation.  Loss of employees could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues.  The ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to BlackRock’s growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining clients. The market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, financial advisers and other professionals is competitive. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain required personnel. Loss of personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  RISKS RELATED TO KEY RELATIONSHIPS  The failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock and its products.  BlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, risk analytics, market data, market indices and transfer agent roles and other operational needs. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendors to fulfill their obligations could lead to operational and regulatory issues for the Company and in certain of its products, which could result in reputational harm and financial losses for the Company.  Bank of America/Merrill Lynch is an important distributor of BlackRock’s products, and the Company is, therefore, subject to risks associated with the business of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.  Under a global distribution agreement entered into with Merrill Lynch in 2006, Merrill Lynch, which merged with Bank of America on January 1, 2009, provides distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through its various distribution channels. The Company may not be successful in distributing products through Merrill Lynch or in distributing its products and services through other third-party distributors. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it experiences an increase in distribution-related costs, BlackRock’s business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.  Loss of market share within Merrill Lynch’s Global Wealth & Investment Management business could harm operating results.  A significant portion of BlackRock’s revenue has historically come from AUM generated by Merrill Lynch’s Global Wealth & Investment Management (“GWIM”) business. BlackRock’s ability to maintain a strong relationship within GWIM is material to the Company’s future performance. If one of the Company’s competitors gains significant additional market share within the GWIM retail channel at the expense of BlackRock, then BlackRock’s business, results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted.  PNC has agreed to vote as a stockholder in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of PNC.  As discussed in our proxy statement, PNC has agreed to vote all of its voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of its stockholder agreement with BlackRock. As a consequence, if the shares held by PNC constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determination of the BlackRock Board of Directors. This arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over BlackRock in its Board of Directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the Board. At December 31, 2013, PNC owned approximately 20.9% of BlackRock’s voting common stock.  As discussed in our proxy statement, pursuant to our stockholder agreement with PNC, the following may not be done without prior approval of all of the independent directors, or at least two-thirds of the directors, then in office:        •   appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock;        •   any merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction in which beneficial ownership of a majority of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock would be held by persons different than those currently holding such majority of the total voting power, or any sale of all or substantially all assets of BlackRock;        •   any acquisition of any person or business which has a consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year that equals or exceeds 20% of BlackRock’s consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year if such acquisition involves the current or potential issuance of BlackRock capital stock constituting more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock issued and outstanding immediately after completion of such acquisition;        •   any acquisition of any person or business constituting a line of business that is materially different from the lines of business BlackRock and its controlled affiliates are engaged in at that time if such acquisition involves consideration in excess of 10% of the total assets of BlackRock on a consolidated basis;        •   except for repurchases otherwise permitted under the stockholder agreement, any repurchase by BlackRock or any subsidiary of shares of BlackRock capital stock such that after giving effect to such repurchase BlackRock and its subsidiaries shall have repurchased more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock within the 12-month period ending on the date of such repurchase;        •   any amendment to BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or        •   any matter requiring stockholder approval pursuant to the rules of the NYSE.     20    Table of Contents       Additionally, BlackRock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of PNC:        •   any sale of any subsidiary of BlackRock, the annualized revenues of which, together with the annualized revenues of any other subsidiaries disposed of within the same year, are more than 20% of the annualized revenues of BlackRock for the preceding fiscal year on a consolidated basis;        •   for so long as BlackRock is a subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act, entering into any business or activity that is prohibited for any such subsidiary under the BHC Act;        •   any amendment of any provision of a stockholder agreement between BlackRock and any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to PNC or materially more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock than to PNC;        •   any amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to the rights of PNC or more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock, or any settlement or consent in a regulatory enforcement matter that would be reasonably likely to cause PNC or any of its affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or license or other material adverse regulatory consequences; or        •   a voluntary bankruptcy or similar filing by BlackRock.  PNC owns a large portion of BlackRock’s capital stock. Future sales of our common stock in the public market by the Company or PNC could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  As of December 31, 2013, PNC owned 21.9% of the Company’s capital stock. The Company has entered into a registration rights agreement with PNC. The registration rights agreement provides PNC with the right to cause us to file one or more registration statements for the resale of its shares of capital stock and cooperate in certain underwritten offerings. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market pursuant to registration rights or otherwise, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.  LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS  BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and internationally.  BlackRock’s business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and around the world. See the discussion under “Item 1 – Business – Regulation.” New laws or regulations, or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations in the United States or internationally, could adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities. Violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, temporary or permanent prohibition of the engagement in certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations,   suspensions of personnel or revocation of their licenses or bank charter, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition and cause the Company’s earnings to decline.  BlackRock may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other U.S. regulatory reform initiatives.  As previously mentioned, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “DFA”) was signed into law. The DFA is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be implemented. The adoption of these regulations and decisions will in large measure determine the impact of the DFA on BlackRock. BlackRock is continuing to review what impact the legislation and related rule-making will have on its business, financial condition and results of operations.  The DFA charges the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”). Should BlackRock be designated a systemically important financial institution (a “SIFI”), it could be subject to these enhanced prudential, capital, supervisory and other requirements, which, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely impact BlackRock’s business and operations.  The DFA and its regulations could adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities, could require BlackRock to change certain business practices and could expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and tax costs).  Provisions of the DFA referred to as the “Volcker Rule” created a new section of the BHC Act that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively “covered funds”). Final regulations implementing the Volcker Rule were issued on December 10, 2013; entities subject to the Volcker Rule must conform their activities to the requirements of the final implementing regulations no later than July 21, 2015, subject to the granting of extensions that are available in limited circumstances. Because BlackRock is treated as a non-bank subsidiary of PNC under the Federal Reserve’s current interpretation of the BHC Act, BlackRock will be required to comply with the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule will limit BlackRock’s ability to invest in covered funds, require BlackRock to remove its name from the name of its covered funds, and limit investments in covered funds by BlackRock employees, among other restrictions. Depending on the availability of statutory extensions, BlackRock could be required to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds, including at a discount, depending on market conditions. These limitations and restrictions could disadvantage BlackRock against competitors that are not subject to the Volcker Rule in our ability to attract clients into BlackRock covered funds and to retain employees. Finally, the restrictions on proprietary     21    Table of Contents        trading in the Volcker Rule could impact the ability of our trading counterparties to make markets and provide liquidity in certain securities, which could have a negative impact on our ability to manage funds and client accounts that transact in those securities.  Further, the full implementation of regulations under the DFA relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives could impact the manner by which BlackRock-advised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives, and could significantly increase the costs of derivatives trading conducted by BlackRock on behalf of its clients. BlackRock will also need to build new compliance mechanisms to monitor compliance with SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) rules concerning, among other things, the registration and regulation of commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors (and the accompanying registration and regulation of such entities by the National Futures Association), the applicability of CFTC rules and regulations to offshore funds, accounts and counterparties, and requirements to centrally clear certain swap transactions and to execute certain swap transaction only on or through CFTC-registered trading venues. BlackRock, on behalf of its clients, is also preparing for the implementation of trade reporting, documentation, and mandated central clearing of swaps requirements in the EU and other jurisdictions globally. Inconsistencies and potential contradictions in the rules adopted by various global regulators will increase the operational and legal risks associated with trading in derivatives.  In addition, BlackRock has begun reporting certain information about a number of its private funds to the SEC and certain information about a number of its commodity pools to the CFTC, pursuant to systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by both agencies, which have required, and will continue to require, investments in people and systems to assure timely and accurate reporting.  The SEC, the Internal Revenue Service and the CFTC each continue to review the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds, which could result in regulations that further limit the use of such instruments by mutual funds. If adopted, these limitations could require BlackRock to change certain mutual fund business practices or to register additional entities with the CFTC, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions.  The SEC has recently promulgated new rules that give effect to a section of the DFA that requires municipal advisors (as that term is defined in the statute) to register with the SEC. The new rules require entities that provide certain types of advice to, or on behalf of, or solicit municipal entities or certain other persons, to register with the SEC and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) as municipal advisors, thereby subjecting those entities to new or additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB. BlackRock is reviewing what impact the new rules will have on its business, financial condition and results of operation.  The foregoing regulatory changes, and other reforms globally, could also lead to business disruptions, could adversely impact the value of assets in which BlackRock has invested on behalf of clients and/or via seed or co-investments, and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms, could make it more difficult for BlackRock to conduct certain business activities or distinguish itself from competitors. See “Item 1   – Business” above for additional information regarding certain laws and regulations that affect BlackRock’s business.  BlackRock may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes related to money market mutual funds.  Regulatory authorities, including the SEC, the FSOC and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, continue to focus on the need for additional regulations for money market mutual funds. In June 2013, the SEC issued for public comment a proposal to reform the regulatory structure governing money market funds and address the perceived systemic risks that money market funds present. The SEC’s proposal also proposes many other changes to disclosure and portfolio construction requirements for money market funds. If adopted by the SEC, these reform proposals could significantly affect money market fund products and the entire money market fund industry. In light of the uncertainty regarding what changes may ultimately be adopted in a final SEC rule, the Company cannot predict what investor appetite will be for money market mutual fund products following the adoption of any such reforms or the impact of such reforms on BlackRock.  Failure to comply with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) or the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) and related regulations could result in substantial harm to BlackRock’s reputation and results of operations.  Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act and BlackRock’s U.S. mutual funds, closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations and fiduciary duties on registered investment advisers, including record-keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on self-dealing. The Investment Company Act imposes similar obligations, as well as additional detailed operational and compliance requirements on investment advisers to registered investment companies. The failure of any of BlackRock’s relevant subsidiaries to comply with the Advisers Act or the Investment Company Act could cause the SEC to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts, including censure, termination of an investment adviser’s registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to SEC-registered funds, and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to the Company’s reputation, any of which could cause its earnings to decline.  Failure to comply with ERISA regulations could result in penalties and cause the Company’s earnings to decline.  Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit specified transactions involving ERISA plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The failure of any of BlackRock’s relevant subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties that could reduce the Company’s earnings to decline.     22    Table of Contents       BlackRock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities.  As described in “Item 1-Business”, PNC owns approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock. Based on the Federal Reserve’s current interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”), this ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a non-bank subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act. As a non-bank subsidiary of PNC, BlackRock is subject to banking regulation, including the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve. Such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that BlackRock may conduct. The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit BlackRock from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice, and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. PNC is regulated as a “financial holding company” under the BHC Act, which allows PNC and BlackRock to engage in a much broader set of activities than would otherwise be permitted under the BHC Act; any failure of PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. Furthermore, the Volcker Rule, which is a part of the BHC Act, will affect the method by which BlackRock invests in and operates its private investment funds, including private equity funds, hedge funds and funds of funds. BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary is also subject to regulation by the OCC, and is subject to capital requirements established by the OCC. The OCC has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary. Being subject to banking regulation, including the Volcker Rule, may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations.  Failure to comply with laws and regulations in the European Union in which BlackRock operates could result in substantial harm to BlackRock’s reputation and results of operations.  In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European Commission set out a detailed plan for EU financial reform, outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives, regulations and recommendations of which the review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) was a part. These, together with the changes introduced by the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), will have direct and indirect effects on BlackRock’s operations in the European Economic Area, including increased compliance, disclosure and other obligations, which could adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to expand in these markets.  The Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) regulates BlackRock’s subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and branches in the European Union and the Prudential Regulation Authority the (“PRA”) also regulates one BlackRock subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FCA and/or the PRA is required to conduct any financial services related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. BlackRock’s U.K. subsidiaries require authorization by the FCA under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 in order to conduct their financial services-related business in the United Kingdom. The FCA’s rules govern the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries’ capital resources requirements,   senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients and systems and controls, while the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements imposed on firms. Breaches of these rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries or employees.  In addition, these subsidiaries, and other European subsidiaries, branches or representative offices, must comply with the pan-European regime established by MiFID, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the EEA, as well as the Capital Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital requirements. As discussed under “Item 1 - Business - Regulation,” in the aftermath of the financial crisis the European Commission adopted a detailed plan to complete the EU’s financial reform, outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives, regulations and recommendations. The AIFMD has been implemented in some EU countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, but several other EU member states are still in various stages of the adoption process. Compliance with the AIFMD’s requirements is likely to restrict marketing by funds subject to the AIFMD and place additional compliance and disclosure obligations regarding remuneration, capital requirements, leverage, valuation, stakes in EU companies, depositaries, the domicile of custodians and liquidity management. In addition, UCITS IV was adopted into national law of each EU member state (except Portugal).  There are also European Commission consultations in process that are intended to improve retail investor protection including: (i) UCITS V, which addresses, among other items, custodial liability and remuneration of UCITS managers, which are intended to be consistent with the equivalent provisions of the AIFMD; (ii) UCITS VI, which will address, among other items, the eligible assets which a UCITS fund can invest in, efficient portfolio management techniques and extraordinary liquidity management tools; and (iii) Regulation on Money Market Funds (“MMFs”), which will introduce new regulatory measures that will apply to European MMFs. The European Commission’s proposals on packaged retail investment products (“PRIPs”) are to be implemented through the strengthening of MiFID standards (for non-insurance PRIPs), revisions to the Insurance Mediation Directive’s selling standard (for all insurance-based PRIPs) and new investor disclosure requirements for all PRIPs through a separate EU legislative process, which is expected to be adopted in 2014 and come into effect in 2016. In the United Kingdom, the Bribery Act 2010 came into force in July 2011 and has required the implementation of additional procedures on the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries.  In addition, rules introduced in the United Kingdom following a retail distribution review initiated by the FCA’s predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, changed how investment advice is paid for in the United Kingdom for all retail investment products. Regulation (EU) no 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (“EMIR”), was adopted in August 2012, and requires (i) the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts from February 2014. Finally, the CRD IV package of reforms on prudential requirements for credit institutions and     23    Table of Contents        investment firms, which became effective on January 1, 2014, will have direct and indirect impacts on the Company’s EU-regulated subsidiaries.  Failure to comply with laws and regulations in the Asia-Pacific region and other non-U.S. jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates could result in substantial harm to BlackRock’s reputation and results of operations.  In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the “FIEL”) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL. In addition, the BlackRock subsidiary has recently obtained a license for real estate broker business from the Tokyo governor and, therefore, must comply with various regulations set forth in the Real Estate Brokerage Business Act.  In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”). ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. Failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the relevant subsidiaries’ licenses in Australia.  The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the “SFO”), which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the “SFC”). The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time. Failure to comply with the SFO and other applicable laws, regulations, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC could result in penalties, sanctions and the suspension or revocations of the licenses granted by the SFC.  There are similar legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business or where the funds and products it manages are organized. Failure to comply with laws and regulations in any of these jurisdictions could result in substantial harm to BlackRock’s reputation and results of operation and result in fines or sanctions for BlackRock or its employees.  Failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock’s reputation and results of operations.  Of note among the various international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and increasingly   stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and personnel to enhance its monitoring and reporting functions and improve the timeliness and accuracy of its disclosures. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading pose a risk that errors or omissions will occasionally occur, which could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation and results of operation.  Changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations or challenges to BlackRock’s tax positions with respect to historical transactions may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.  BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws and regulations by U.S. or non-U.S. authorities. The Company manages significant assets in products and accounts that have specific tax and after-tax related objectives, which could be adversely impacted by changes in tax policy, particularly with respect to U.S. municipal income, the U.S. individual income tax rate on qualified dividends and, globally, alternative products.  Additionally, any new legislation, modification or interpretation of tax laws could also impact BlackRock’s corporate tax position. The application of complex tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition.  Legal proceedings could adversely affect operating results, financial condition and cash flows for a particular period.  Many aspects of BlackRock’s business involve substantial risks of legal liability. The Company, certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings’ by regulatory authorities, including the SEC, OCC, DOL, CFTC and FCA. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings could if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the SEC to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations, including censure, termination of an investment adviser’s registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to SEC-registered funds, and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to the Company’s reputation, any of which could cause its earnings to decline. From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations or proceedings. Additionally, certain of the     24    Table of Contents        investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which could potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages.  Item 1B. Unresolved Staff  Comments  The Company has no unresolved comments from the SEC staff relating to BlackRock’s periodic or current reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.  Item 2. Properties  BlackRock’s principal office, which is leased, is located at 55 East 52nd Street, New York, New York. BlackRock leases additional office space in New York City at 40 East 52nd Street and throughout the world, including Boston, Chicago, Edinburgh, Gurgaon (India), Hong Kong, London, Melbourne, Munich, Princeton (New Jersey), San Francisco, Seattle, Singapore, Sydney, Taipei and Tokyo. The Company also owns an 84,500 square foot office building in Wilmington (Delaware).  Item 3. Legal Proceedings  From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. federal, state governmental and domestic and international regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide or other investigations or proceedings. It is BlackRock’s policy to cooperate fully with such inquiries. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Additionally, certain BlackRock-sponsored investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which potentially could harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages.  Italian Securities Regulator Proceeding  The Italian securities regulator, Commissione Nazionale per le Societa e la Borsa (“Consob”), initiated a civil proceeding on January 3, 2014 against Nigel Bolton, a portfolio manager and head of BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited’s European Equity Team (“EET”), in connection with   the sale of shares in the Italian oil and gas services company Saipem, SpA in January 2013.  Consob alleges that Mr. Bolton, on behalf of certain BlackRock clients, sold, or influenced the sale of, approximately 10.7 million shares of Saipem using material, non-public information thereby avoiding client losses of over €114.5 million. The EET’s sale of Saipem shares occurred between January 25 and January 29, 2013, and Saipem announced negative news following the market close on January 29, 2013. While BlackRock is not charged in the proceeding, it may be liable for the actions of its employee.  BlackRock conducted a thorough investigation and found no evidence to support the allegations. As a result of the investigation, BlackRock believes that the sale of Saipem shares was made as a fiduciary based on publicly available information that was widely disseminated in the marketplace, including negative publicity and a third-party analyst research report reducing earnings estimates, which was issued to the market before trading on January 25, 2013.  Consob also alleges that BlackRock declined to provide Consob with information and was an obstacle to Consob’s investigation. BlackRock believes it has fully cooperated with Consob, and it will continue to do so.  While under Italian law the potential penalty could be greater than the loss actually avoided, BlackRock believes that Mr. Bolton will not be found liable and, as a result, neither Mr. Bolton nor BlackRock will incur any penalty.  All Legal Proceedings  Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability, if any, arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material effect on BlackRock’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, there is no assurance as to whether any such pending or threatened matters will have a material effect on BlackRock’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows in any future reporting period. Due to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of these matters, management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters.  Item 4.

(3) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. In addition, unvested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are not included for 2012 and 2011 as they were deemed to be participating securities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Upon vesting of the participating RSUs, the shares were added to the weighted-average shares outstanding that resulted in an increase to the percentage of net income attributable to common shares. The Company’s remaining participating securities vested in January 2013.      (4) Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity, excluding appropriated retained earnings, divided by total common and preferred shares outstanding at December 31 of the respective year-end.    2013 COMPARED WITH 2012  GAAP. Operating income of $3,857 million increased $333 million from 2012. In the second quarter of 2013, as a result of an initial public offering of PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (the “PennyMac IPO”), the Company recorded a noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $39 million related to the carrying value of its equity method investment. Subsequent to the PennyMac IPO, the Company made a   charitable contribution of 6.1 million units of its equity method investment with a fair value of $124 million to a new donor advised fund (the “Charitable Contribution”). In connection with the Charitable Contribution, the Company also recorded a noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the contributed investment. For further information, see Note 11, Other Assets, to the consolidated financial statements.     30    Table of Contents       Operating income reflects growth in base fees and strong performance fees and higher BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue, partially offset by higher expenses, primarily due to the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution and higher revenue-related expenses. The results for 2013 also included $43 million of organizational alignment costs, reflecting compensation and severance costs associated with the alignment of staffing with the Company’s strategic priorities and growth opportunities. Operating income in 2012 included a $30 million charge related to a contribution to certain of the Company’s bank-managed short-term investment funds (“STIFs”). Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI increased $133 million due to the $39 million pre-tax gain related to the PennyMac IPO and the $80 million gain related to the Charitable Contribution and higher net positive marks on investments during 2013 compared with 2012. Income tax expense included a $69 million net noncash benefit for 2013 and a $30 million net noncash benefit for 2012. The net noncash benefits for both periods primarily related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and domestic state and local income tax changes. In addition, 2013 income tax expense included an approximately $48 million tax benefit recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution, a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards and benefits from certain nonrecurring items. Earnings per diluted common share rose $3.08, or 22%, compared with 2012 due to higher net income and the benefit of share repurchases.  As Adjusted. Operating income of $4,024 million and operating margin of 41.4% increased $450 million and 100 basis points, respectively, from 2012. The current year results included the previously mentioned organizational alignment costs of $43 million and the $39 million pre-tax gain related to the PennyMac IPO. Income tax expense on an as adjusted basis included a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items and excluded the $69 million net noncash benefit in 2013 and the $30 million net noncash benefit in 2012 described above. Earnings per diluted common share rose $2.90, or 21%, from 2012. The financial impact related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from as adjusted results for 2013.  2012 COMPARED WITH 2011  GAAP. Operating income of $3,524 million and operating margin of 37.7% increased $275 million and 190 basis points, respectively, from 2011 reflecting growth in base fees and higher performance fees. Operating income in 2012 included a $30 million charge related to the contribution to the Company’s STIFs. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, increased $80 million due to higher net positive marks on investments in 2012 compared with 2011, partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from long-term debt issuances in May 2012 and May 2011. In 2012, income tax expense included a $21 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and a $50 million net noncash benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state   and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. In 2011, income tax expenses included a $24 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and $198 million of net noncash tax benefits due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. Earnings per diluted common share rose $1.42 from 2011 due to higher net income and the benefit of share repurchases. During 2012, the Company repurchased 9.1 million shares.  As Adjusted. Operating income of $3,574 million and operating margin of 40.4% increased $182 million and 70 basis points, respectively, from 2011 reflecting higher revenues. Operating income on an as adjusted basis excluded non-GAAP expense adjustments totaling $50 million in 2012 and $143 million in 2011. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, increased $71 million. Income tax expense on an as adjusted basis excluded the $50 million and $198 million noncash benefits for 2012 and 2011, respectively, described above. Earnings per diluted common share rose $1.83 from 2011 reflecting the improvement in net income and the benefit of share repurchases.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK  BlackRock’s highly diversified multi-product platform was created to meet the needs of its clients in all market environments. BlackRock is positioned to provide active and passive investment solutions across asset classes and geographies and leverage BlackRock Solutions’ world-class risk management, analytics and advisory capabilities on behalf of clients.  BlackRock’s key client themes — Income, Alternatives, Outcome Investing, Strategic Beta, Emerging Markets and Retirement Solutions — are expected to drive the Company’s organic growth across its businesses.  BlackRock’s Retail strategy is focused on an outcome-oriented approach to creating client solutions, including active, passive and alternative products, and enhanced distribution. In the United States, BlackRock is leveraging its integrated wholesaler force to further penetrate wire house distribution platforms and gain share amongst Registered Investment Advisors. Internationally, BlackRock continues to diversify the range of investment solutions available to clients, penetrate new distribution segments and capitalize on regulatory change impacting retrocession arrangements.  iShares will be driven by the continued shift from active to passive investment strategies and adoption of ETFs. iShares is positioned to benefit from global market expansion, growth in fixed income ETFs and continued product innovation, while focusing on increasing U.S. market share, especially in the “buy-and-hold” segment.  BlackRock believes Institutional results will be driven by strength in specialty areas, including Defined Contribution, Financial Institutions and Official Institutions, more effective cross-selling efforts and leveraging BlackRock Solutions’ analytical and risk management expertise.     31    Table of Contents       Assuming a stable market environment, BlackRock anticipates that organic growth, coupled with the benefits of scale, should result in increasing operating margins over time.  BlackRock believes that earnings growth and shareholder returns should also be positively impacted by the Company’s commitment to a consistent and predictable capital management strategy.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators,   for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows:  (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted:  Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items management deems nonrecurring, recurring infrequently or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value, as indicated in the table below. Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors.                     (in millions)   2013     2012     2011     Operating income, GAAP basis   $ 3,857     $ 3,524     $ 3,249     Non-GAAP expense adjustments:                  PNC LTIP funding obligation     33       22       44     Charitable Contribution     124       —       —     U.K. lease exit costs     —       (8 )      63     Contribution to STIFs     —       30       —     Merrill Lynch compensation contribution     —       —       7     Restructuring charges     —       —       32     Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans     10       6       (3 )    Operating income, as adjusted     4,024       3,574       3,392     Closed-end fund launch costs     16       22       26     Closed-end fund launch commissions     2       3       3     Operating income used for operating margin measurement   $ 4,042     $ 3,599     $ 3,421     Revenue, GAAP basis   $  10,180     $  9,337     $  9,081     Non-GAAP adjustments:                  Distribution and servicing costs     (353 )      (364 )      (386 )    Amortization of deferred sales commissions     (52 )      (55 )      (81 )    Revenue used for operating margin measurement   $ 9,775     $ 8,918     $ 8,614     Operating margin, GAAP basis     37.9 %      37.7 %      35.8 %    Operating margin, as adjusted     41.4 %      40.4 %      39.7 %         •   Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded or to be funded through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (“Merrill Lynch”) cash compensation contribution has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. The expense related to the Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution ceased at the end of third quarter 2011. In 2013, the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature and because the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million directly related to the contributed PennyMac investment is reported in nonoperating income (expense). The U.K. lease exit costs represent costs to exit two locations in London in 2011. The amount in 2012 represents an adjustment related to the estimated lease exit costs initially recorded in 2011.          The contribution to STIFs represents a contribution to certain of the Company’s bank-managed STIFs. Restructuring charges consist of compensation costs and professional fees. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense).  Management believes operating income exclusive of these items is a useful measure in evaluating BlackRock’s operating performance and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented.        •    Operating margin, as adjusted, allows BlackRock to compare performance from period to period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may have an economic offset in     32    Table of Contents             nonoperating income (expense). BlackRock also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. The non-GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of BlackRock’s revenues and expenses.  Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.  Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue the Company earns. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues.  (b) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, as adjusted, is presented below. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis.  Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides comparability of information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to results. As compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, substantially offsets the gain (loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s nonoperating results that impact book value. During 2013, the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the contributed PennyMac investment   has been excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted due to its nonrecurring nature and because the more than offsetting associated Charitable Contribution expense of $124 million is reported in operating income.                    (in millions)   2013     2012     2011     Nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis   $  116     $  (54 )    $  (114 )    Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI     19       (18 )      2     Nonoperating income (expense)     97       (36 )      (116 )    Gain related to Charitable Contribution     (80 )      —       —     Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans     (10 )      (6 )      3     Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted   $ 7     $ (42 )    $ (113 )   (c) Net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.  See note (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation, Merrill Lynch compensation contribution, Charitable Contribution, U.K. lease exit costs, contribution to STIFs and restructuring charges.  The 2013 results included a tax benefit of approximately $48 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. The tax benefit has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted due to the nonrecurring nature of the Charitable Contribution. During 2013, income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and domestic state and local income tax changes. During 2012, income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. During 2011, income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.     33    Table of Contents                      (in millions, except per share data)   2013     2012     2011     Net income attributable to BlackRock, GAAP basis   $  2,932     $  2,458     $  2,337     Non-GAAP adjustments, net of tax:(d)                  PNC LTIP funding obligation     23       14       30     Amount related to the Charitable Contribution     (4 )      —       —     U.K. lease exit costs     —       (5 )      43     Contribution to STIFs     —       21       —     Merrill Lynch compensation contribution     —       —       5     Restructuring charges     —       —       22     Income tax changes     (69 )      (50 )      (198 )    Net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted   $ 2,882     $ 2,438     $ 2,239     Allocation of net income, as adjusted, to common shares(e)   $ 2,882     $ 2,435     $ 2,218     Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding(f)     173.8       178.0       187.1     Diluted earnings per common share, GAAP basis(f)   $ 16.87     $ 13.79     $ 12.37     Diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted(f)   $ 16.58     $ 13.68     $ 11.85        (d) For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustments, including the PNC LTIP funding obligation, Merrill Lynch compensation contribution, U.K. lease exit costs, contribution to STIFs and restructuring charges were tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amounts for 2013 also included the tax benefit of approximately $48 million related to the Charitable Contribution.      (e) Amounts for 2012 and 2011 exclude net income attributable to participating securities (see below).      (f) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.        Prior to 2013, certain unvested restricted stock units were not included in diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding as they were deemed participating securities in accordance with required provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 260-10, Earnings per Share. In 2012 and 2011, average outstanding participating securities were 0.2 million and 1.8 million, respectively.

AUM increased $532.5 billion, or 14%, to $4.324 trillion at December 31, 2013 from $3.792 trillion at December 31, 2012. The increase in AUM was driven by net market appreciation of $398.7 billion, net inflows of $119.7 billion and acquired AUM related to the MGPA acquisition and the Credit Suisse ETF Transaction, partially offset by foreign exchange net losses.  Net market appreciation of $398.7 billion included $404.3 billion from equity products, primarily due to positive movements in U.S. and global equity markets.  The $12.9 billion decrease in AUM from foreign exchange movements was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling and the euro.     37    Table of Contents      The following table presents the component changes in AUM by client type and product for 2012.

(5) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Redemptions include planned client distributions.    AUM increased $278.9 billion, or 8%, to $3.792 trillion at December 31, 2012 from $3.513 trillion at December 31, 2011. The increase in AUM was driven largely by market gains and positive net new business, excluding the effect of two single client low-fee, institutional index fixed income outflows of $36.0 billion and $74.2 billion in the first quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2012, respectively. Total flows included $74.5 billion of planned advisory distributions and acquired AUM related to the SRPEP and the Claymore Transactions of $13.7 billion.  Net market appreciation of $321.4 billion reflected growth in U.S. and global equity markets and $67.8 billion appreciation in fixed income products across the majority of strategies.  The $15.7 billion net increase in AUM from converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling and the euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.  DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESULTS  Introduction  BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of AUM or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in AUM, including market   appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.  BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand.  Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the     39    Table of Contents        timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. Historically, the magnitude of performance fees in the third and fourth quarters generally exceeds that of the first two calendar quarters in a year due to the greater number of products with performance measurement periods that end on either September 30 or December 31.  BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. The Company’s Aladdin® operating platform serves as the investment/risk solutions system for BlackRock and other institutional investors. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met.  BlackRock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions. Through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability-driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies and target date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors. BlackRock is also able to service these clients via its Aladdin platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures.  The Company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions from acting as a broker-dealer in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur.  The Company also earns revenue related to certain strategic investments accounted for as equity method investments.  Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets.        •   Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs.      •   Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities under a global distribution agreement, to PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain BlackRock products.        •   Direct fund expenses primarily consist of third-party nonadvisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expenses, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business.        •   General and administration expenses include marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expenses related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, closed-end fund launch costs and other general and administration expenses, including the impact of foreign currency remeasurement.  Nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. Other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. BlackRock primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, distressed credit/mortgage debt securities, hedge funds and real estate. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.  In addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”).

Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $8,739 million for 2013 increased $667 million from $8,072 million in 2012 due to growth in long-term average AUM. Securities lending fees decreased $63 million from 2012 to $447 million in 2013 driven by lower spreads consistent with industry trends, partially offset by an increase in average balances of securities on loan.  Investment advisory performance fees were $561 million in 2013 compared with $463 million in 2012, primarily reflecting higher fees from alternative products, including fund of funds and single-strategy hedge funds. Both years reflected significant fees from the liquidation of opportunistic funds.  BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue in 2013 totaled $577 million compared with $518 million in 2012. The current year reflected a $47 million increase in Aladdin business revenues to $421 million and higher advisory assignments revenue.  Other revenue increased $17 million, largely reflecting higher transition management service fees and higher earnings from certain strategic investments.  2012 Compared with 2011  Revenues increased $256 million, or 3%, from 2011 reflecting market growth, positive flows, improvements in securities lending revenue and strength in performance fees.    Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue totaled $8,072 million in 2012 compared with $7,896 million in 2011, reflecting an improvement in securities lending revenue and higher advisory fees reflecting higher long-term average AUM. Securities lending fees were $510 million in 2012 compared with $397 million in 2011, reflecting higher lending rates and an increase in average balances of securities on loan.  Investment advisory performance fees were $463 million in 2012 compared with $371 million in 2011, primarily reflecting higher performance fees from alternative products, including fees from a disposition-related opportunistic fund, which were partially offset by lower fees from equity products.  BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue in 2012 increased $8 million, or 2%, from 2011, primarily due to a $51 million increase in Aladdin business revenue to $374 million, partially offset by the run off of revenues associated with a lower level of advisory assets and lower one-time revenue from advisory assignments.  Distribution fees of $71 million in 2012 decreased $29 million, or 29%, from $100 million in 2011, primarily due to lower AUM in certain share classes of BlackRock funds.  Other revenue increased $9 million, largely reflecting higher earnings from certain strategic investments, partially offset by lower sales commissions and marketing fees earned for services to distribute iPath® products.     42    Table of Contents      Expenses                    (in millions)   2013     2012     2011     Expenses, GAAP:                  Employee compensation and benefits   $ 3,560     $ 3,287     $ 3,199     Distribution and servicing costs     353       364       386     Amortization of deferred sales commissions     52       55       81     Direct fund expenses     657       591       563     General and administration:                  Marketing and promotional     409       384       315     Occupancy and office related     277       248       373     Portfolio services     203       196       189     Technology     160       150       146     Professional services     128       114       139     Communications     37       39       40     Regulatory, filing and license fees     31       17       16     Charitable Contribution     124       —       —     Closed-end fund launch costs     16       22       26     Other general and administration     155       189       171     Total general and administration expenses     1,540       1,359       1,415     Restructuring charges     —       —       32     Amortization of intangible assets     161       157       156     Total expenses, GAAP   $ 6,323     $ 5,813     $ 5,832     Less non-GAAP expense adjustments:                  Employee compensation and benefits:                  PNC LTIP funding obligation     33       22       44     Merrill Lynch compensation contribution     —       —       7     Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans     10       6       (3 )    Subtotal     43       28       48     General and administration:                  Charitable Contribution     124       —       —     U.K. lease exit costs     —       (8 )      63     Contribution to STIFs     —       30       —     Subtotal     124       22       63     Restructuring charges     —       —       32     Total non-GAAP expense adjustments     167       50       143     Expenses, as adjusted:                  Employee compensation and benefits     3,517       3,259       3,151     Distribution and servicing costs     353       364       386     Amortization of deferred sales commissions     52       55       81     Direct fund expenses     657       591       563     General and administration     1,416       1,337       1,352     Amortization of intangible assets     161       157       156     Total expenses, as adjusted   $  6,156     $  5,763     $  5,689      2013 Compared with 2012  GAAP. Expenses increased $510 million, or 9%, from 2012, primarily reflecting higher revenue-related expenses and the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution.  Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $273 million, or 8%, to $3,560 million in 2013 from $3,287 million in 2012, reflecting increased headcount and higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income, including higher performance fees. Employees at December 31, 2013 totaled approximately 11,400 compared with approximately 10,500 at December 31, 2012.  Distribution and servicing costs totaled $353 million in 2013 compared with $364 million in 2012. These costs included payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global   distribution agreement and PNC, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs for 2013 and 2012 included $184 million and $195 million, respectively, of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.  Direct fund expenses increased $66 million, reflecting higher average AUM, primarily related to iShares, where BlackRock pays certain nonadvisory expenses of the funds.  General and administration expenses increased $181 million, largely driven by the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution, higher marketing and promotional costs and various lease exit costs. The full year 2012 included a one-time $30 million contribution to STIFs.     43    Table of Contents       As Adjusted. Expenses, as adjusted, increased $393 million, or 7%, to $6,156 million in 2013 from $5,763 million in 2012. The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, direct fund expenses and general and administration expenses.  2012 Compared with 2011  GAAP. Expenses decreased $19 million to $5,813 million from 2011, primarily reflecting a reduction in general and administration expenses, amortization of deferred sales commissions and distribution and servicing costs, partially offset by higher employee compensation and benefits and direct fund expenses. General and administration expenses in 2012 included a $30 million charge related to a contribution to STIFs. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $88 million, or 3%, to $3,287 million in 2012 from $3,199 million in 2011, reflecting an increase in incentive compensation driven by higher operating income, including higher performance fees. Employees at December 31, 2012 totaled approximately 10,500 compared with approximately 10,100 at December 31, 2011.  Distribution and servicing costs decreased $22 million, or 6%, to $364 million in 2012 from $386 million in 2011. The $22 million decrease related to lower service fees from variable annuities and lower cash management-related distribution costs. Distribution and servicing costs for 2012 and 2011 included $195 million and $207 million, respectively, of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.  Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $26 million, or 32%, to $55 million in 2012 from $81 million in 2011, primarily related to lower sales in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds.  Direct fund expenses increased $28 million from 2011 million, primarily reflecting growth in average AUM for the funds (predominantly iShares) where BlackRock pays certain nonadvisory expenses of the funds.  General and administration expenses decreased $56 million, or 4%, to $1,359 million in 2012 from $1,415 million in 2011. Lower occupancy and office-related expenses, primarily due to $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs incurred in 2011, and   lower professional services costs contributed to the overall net decrease in general and administration expenses. The decrease in general and administration expenses was partially offset by higher marketing and promotional expenses in connection with the brand campaign and a one-time contribution to STIFs.  Restructuring charges of $32 million recorded in 2011, primarily related to severance, accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards, and legal and outplacement costs associated with a reduction in work force and reengineering efforts.  As Adjusted. Expenses, as adjusted, increased $74 million, or 1%, to $5,763 million in 2012 from $5,689 million in 2011. The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits and direct fund expenses, partially offset by a reduction in amortization of deferred sales commissions, distribution and servicing costs and general and administration expenses.

Net interest expense increased $10 million from 2012 primarily due to lower dividend income.  For further information on the Company’s long-term debt, see Liquidity and Capital Resources herein.  2012 Compared with 2011  Net gains on investments increased $117 million from 2011 due to higher net positive marks in 2012 compared with 2011.

The Company’s tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions, which have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, include the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Canada and the Netherlands. U.S. income taxes were not provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States.  2013. The GAAP effective tax rate of 25.8% for 2013 included a $69 million net noncash benefit primarily related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and domestic state and local income tax changes. In addition, 2013 included the approximately $48 million tax benefit recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution, a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items.     45    Table of Contents       The as adjusted effective tax rate of 28.5% for 2013 included a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items and excluded the $69 million net noncash benefit and the $48 million tax benefit related to the Charitable Contribution mentioned above.  2012. The GAAP effective tax rate of 29.5% for 2012 included a $21 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and a $50 million net noncash benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure.  The as adjusted effective tax rate of 31.0% for 2012 excluded the $50 million net noncash tax benefit mentioned above.  2011. The GAAP effective tax rate of 25.4% for 2011 included a $24 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and $198 million of net noncash tax benefits due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation.  The 2011 as adjusted effective tax rate of 31.7% included the $24 million benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities and excluded the $198 million net noncash benefit.  BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW  As Adjusted Balance Sheet  The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements, consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and consolidated sponsored investment funds.  The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity (excluding appropriated retained earnings related to consolidated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”)) or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure,   as an economic presentation of its total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements  Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients.  In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral.  Consolidated VIEs  At December 31, 2013, BlackRock’s consolidated VIEs included multiple CLOs and one private investment fund. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company and the Company has no obligation to settle the liabilities of the VIEs. While BlackRock has no material economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee, as well as a potential performance fee, for the service of managing these assets on behalf of clients.  Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds  The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds primarily because it is deemed to control such funds. The Company may not be readily able to access cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company may not be readily able to sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.     46    Table of Contents                                  December 31, 2013               Segregated client assets generating advisory fees in which BlackRock has no economic interest or liability          (in millions)   GAAPBasis     SeparateAccountAssets/Collateral     ConsolidatedVIEs     ConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds     AsAdjusted     Assets                            Cash and cash equivalents   $ 4,390     $ —     $ —     $ 114     $ 4,276     Accounts receivable     2,247       —       —       —       2,247     Investments     2,151       —       —       94       2,057     Assets of consolidated VIEs     2,486       —       2,486       —       —     Separate account assets and collateral held under securities lending agreements     176,901       176,901       —       —       —     Other assets(1)     1,217       —       —       20       1,197     Subtotal     189,392       176,901       2,486       228       9,777     Goodwill and intangible assets, net     30,481       —       —       —       30,481     Total assets   $ 219,873     $ 176,901     $ 2,486     $ 228     $ 40,258     Liabilities                            Accrued compensation and benefits   $ 1,747     $ —     $ —     $ —     $ 1,747     Accounts payable and accrued liabilities     1,084       —       —       —       1,084     Borrowings     4,939       —       —       —       4,939     Liabilities of consolidated VIEs     2,443       —       2,443       —       —     Separate account liabilities and collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements     176,901       176,901       —       —       —     Deferred income tax liabilities     5,085       —       —       —       5,085     Other liabilities     1,004       —       —       39       965     Total liabilities     193,203       176,901       2,443       39       13,820     Equity                            Total stockholders’ equity(2)     26,460       —       22       —       26,438     Noncontrolling interests     210       —       21       189       —     Total equity     26,670       —       43       189       26,438     Total liabilities and equity   $  219,873     $  176,901     $  2,486     $  228     $  40,258        (1) Amounts include property and equipment and other assets.      (2) GAAP amount includes $22 million of appropriated retained earnings related solely to consolidated CLOs in which the Company has no equity exposure.    The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.  Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013 and 2012 included $114 million and $133 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2013).  Investments increased $401 million from December 31, 2012 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets increased $169 million from December 31, 2012, primarily due to the MGPA acquisition and Credit Suisse ETF Transaction, partially offset by $161 million of intangible assets amortization expense. Other assets (including property, plant and equipment) increased $34 million from December 31, 2012, primarily related to an increase in strategic investments and other receivables, partially offset by a decrease in property and equipment due to depreciation and a decrease in current taxes receivable.  Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2013 increased $200 million from December 31, 2012, primarily due to 2013 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2013 increased $29 million from December 31, 2012 due to an increase in current income taxes payable and increased accruals, including direct fund expenses, partially offset by lower unit trust payables (substantially offset by a decrease in unit trust receivables recorded within accounts receivable). Borrowings decreased $848 million from December 31, 2012 resulting from the repayments of $750 million and $100 million of long-term and short-term borrowings, respectively.  Net deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2013 decreased $208 million, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with stock compensation and investment income. The change also reflects the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to legislation enacted in the United Kingdom, domestic state and local income tax changes, and realization of tax loss carryforwards. Other liabilities at December 31, 2013 increased $146 million from December 31, 2012, primarily resulting from an increase in liability of unrecognized tax benefits, a contingent liability related to the Credit Suisse ETF Transaction and other operating liabilities.     47    Table of Contents       Investments  Investments totaled $2,151 million at December 31, 2013 and $1,750 million at December 31, 2012. Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The Company presents total investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of its investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating gain (loss) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.  The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors as the economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is substantially offset by a change in compensation expense and the impact of hedged investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

The following table represents the carrying value of the Company’s economic investment exposure, by asset type, at December 31, 2013 and 2012:                (in millions)   December 31,2013     December 31,2012     Private equity   $ 328     $ 298     Real estate     125       122     Distressed credit/mortgage funds     148       214     Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds     348       159     Other investments(1)     634       418     Total “economic” investment exposure   $  1,583     $  1,211        (1) Other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income and equity funds/strategies as well as U.K. government securities held for regulatory purposes.

Certain equity method investees do not account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities under fair value measures, therefore, the Company’s investment in such equity method investees may not represent fair value.      (2) Amounts include cash and cash equivalents, other assets and liabilities that are consolidated from non-VIE sponsored investment funds. See Note 5, Fair Value Disclosures, to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing, for total GAAP investments.    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and VIEs  BlackRock consolidates certain of its sponsored investment funds and CLOs, notwithstanding the fact BlackRock may only have a minority interest, if any, in these funds or CLOs. As a result, the consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of   consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.     The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated VIEs:                        (in millions)   GAAPBasis     Impact onCash Flowsof ConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds     Impact onCash FlowsofConsolidatedVIEs     Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds and VIEs     Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2011   $  3,506     $ 196     $ —     $ 3,310     Cash flows from operating activities     2,240        (256 )      (227 )      2,723     Cash flows from investing activities     (266 )      (211 )      —       (55 )    Cash flows from financing activities     (944 )      404       227       (1,575 )    Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents     70       —       —       70     Net change in cash and cash equivalents     1,100       (63 )      —       1,163     Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2012     4,606       133       —       4,473     Cash flows from operating activities     3,642       (137 )      286       3,493     Cash flows from investing activities     (483 )      39       —       (522 )    Cash flows from financing activities     (3,392 )      79        (286 )       (3,185 )    Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents     17       —       —       17     Net change in cash and cash equivalents     (216 )      (19 )      —       (197 )    Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2013   $ 4,390     $ 114     $ —     $ 4,276      Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenue from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on the Company’s borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.  Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.  Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for 2013 were $522 million and primarily reflected $555 million     49    Table of Contents        of investment purchases and $298 million related to the Credit Suisse ETF Transaction and the MGPA acquisition, partially offset by $342 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments.  Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for 2013 were $3.2 billion, primarily resulting from $1.2 billion of share repurchases, including $1.0 billion in open market transactions and $243 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $1.2 billion of cash dividend payments, a $750 million long-term debt repayment and a $100 million short-term debt repayment. Cash outflows from financing activities were partially offset by cash inflows related to $41 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.  The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:                (in millions)   December 31,2013     December 31,2012     Cash and cash equivalents   $ 4,390     $ 4,606     Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds(1)     (114 )      (133 )    Subtotal     4,276       4,473     Credit facility — undrawn     3,990       3,685     Total liquidity   $  8,266     $  8,158        (1) The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities.  Total liquidity increased $108 million during 2013, primarily reflecting positive operating cash flow and the increased aggregate commitment of the 2013 credit facility to $3.990 billion, partially offset by the $750 million repayment of long-term borrowings, cash payments of 2012 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases, including $1.0 billion in open market transactions, and cash dividend payments.  A significant portion of the Company’s $2,057 million of total investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash.  Share Repurchase Approvals. In January 2013, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an increase in the availability under the Company’s existing share repurchase program to allow for the repurchase of up to 10.2 million shares of BlackRock common stock. The Company repurchased 3.7 million common shares in open market-transactions under the share repurchase program for $1.0 billion during 2013. At December 31, 2013, there were 6.5 million shares still authorized to be repurchased.  Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.  BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  At December 31, 2013, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.1 billion compared with $1.2 billion at December 31, 2012 in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements. The decrease in required net capital was primarily due to a reduction in the BTC minimum Tier 1 capital requirement from $500 million to $385 million in August 2013.  Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2013, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $3.1 billion of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The Company’s current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds.  Short-Term Borrowings  2013 Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2011, the Company entered into a five-year $3.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2011 credit facility”). In March 2012, the 2011 credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date by one year to March 2017 and in April 2012 the amount of the aggregate commitment was increased to $3.785 billion (the “2012 credit facility”). In March 2013, the Company’s credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date by one year to March 2018 and the amount of the aggregate commitment was increased to $3.990 billion (the “2013 credit facility”). The 2013 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2013 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.990 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2013 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2013. The 2013 credit facility provides back-up liquidity, funds ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and funds various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2013, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2013 credit facility.  Commercial Paper Program. On October 14, 2009, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the “CP Program”) under which the Company could issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion. On May 13, 2011, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount that may be borrowed under the CP Program to $3.5 billion. On     50    Table of Contents        May 17, 2012, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount to $3.785 billion. In April 2013, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount for which the Company could issue unsecured CP Notes on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.990 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2013 credit facility. At December 31, 2013, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.  Long-term Borrowings.  At December 31, 2013, the principal amount of long-term borrowings, including the current portion, was $4.95 billion.  2015 and 2022 Notes. In May 2012, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities, including $750 million of 1.375% notes maturing in June 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) and $750 million of 3.375% notes maturing in June 2022 (the “2022 Notes”). Net proceeds were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRock’s common stock and Series B Preferred from Barclays and affiliates and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 2015 Notes and 2022 Notes of approximately $10 million and $25 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, which commenced December 1, 2012. The 2015 Notes and 2022 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. The “make-whole” redemption price represents a price, subject to the specific terms of the 2015 and 2022 Notes and related indenture, that is the greater of (a) par value and (b) the present value of future payments that will not be paid because of an early redemption, which is discounted at a fixed spread over a comparable Treasury security.  2013 and 2021 Notes. In May 2011, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities, including $750 million of 4.25% notes maturing in May 2021 and $750 million of floating rate notes (“2013 Floating Rate Notes”), which were repaid in May 2013. Net proceeds of this   offering were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRock’s Series B Preferred from affiliates of Merrill Lynch. Interest on the 4.25% notes due in 2021 (“2021 Notes”) is payable semi-annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year, which commenced November 24, 2011, and is approximately $32 million per year. The 2021 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price.  In May 2011, in conjunction with the issuance of the 2013 Floating Rate Notes, the Company entered into a $750 million notional interest rate swap maturing in 2013 to hedge the future cash flows of its obligation at a fixed rate of 1.03%. During the second quarter of 2013, the interest rate swap matured and the 2013 Floating Rate Notes were fully repaid.  2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes. In December 2009, the Company issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities, including $0.5 billion of 2.25% notes, which were repaid in December 2012, $1.0 billion of 3.50% notes and $1.0 billion of 5.0% notes maturing in December 2014 and 2019, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to repay borrowings under the CP program, which was used to finance a portion of the BGI Transaction, and for general corporate purposes. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. Interest on the 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes of approximately $35 million and $50 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 10 and December 10 of each year.  2017 Notes. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the “2017 Notes”). A portion of the net proceeds of the 2017 Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC in October 2007 (the “Quellos Transaction”) and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, or approximately $44 million per year. The 2017 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price.     Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies  The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December 31, 2013:                                    (in millions)   2014     2015     2016     2017     2018     Thereafter     Total     Contractual obligations and commitments:                                      Long-term borrowings(1):                                      Principal   $  1,000     $  750     $ —     $  700     $ —     $  2,500     $  4,950     Interest     196       156        151       151        107       218       979     Operating leases      135        127        110        109        106        699        1,286     Purchase obligations     83       77       31       8       —       —       199     Investment commitments     216       —       —       —       —       —       216     Total contractual obligations and commitments     1,630        1,110        292        968        213        3,417        7,630     Contingent obligations:                                      Contingent distribution obligations     172       172       172       —       —       —       516     Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(2)     4       5       11       8       23       24       75     Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations(3)   $  1,806     $ 1,287     $ 475     $ 976     $ 236     $ 3,441     $ 8,221      51    Table of Contents         (1) Long-term borrowings exclude the borrowings of consolidated CLOs. The Company has no obligation to settle the liabilities of these CLOs.      (2) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the expected payment amounts, using foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2013, under the terms of the business acquisition’s agreement. The maximum potential payment amount related to Credit Suisse ETF Transaction is approximately $24 million for any year during a seven year period. There is no maximum amount for payments related to the MGPA Transaction. The fair value of the contingent obligations is not significant to the consolidated statement of financial condition and is recorded within other liabilities.      (3) At December 31, 2013, the Company had $372 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above.  Operating Leases. The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2035. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.  Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2013, the Company’s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Company’s financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2013.  Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2013, the Company had $216 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, infrastructure funds, opportunistic funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company, but which are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.  Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the   limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments, or cash to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable.  Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with the Credit Suisse ETF Transaction, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments annually to Credit Suisse, subject to achieving specified thresholds during a seven year period, subsequent to the acquisition date. In addition, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments related to the MGPA Transaction during a five year period, subject to achieving specified thresholds, subsequent to the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent payments at December 31, 2013 is not significant to the consolidated statement of financial condition and is included in other liabilities. Indemnifications. In many of the Company’s contracts, including the BGI, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (“MLIM”) and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and, therefore, has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2013. See further discussion in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.  On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential losses resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligations under the securities lending agreement. At December 31, 2013, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $118.3 billion. The Company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $124.6 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2013. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at December 31, 2013. The Company currently expects indemnified balances to continue to increase over time.  While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations     52    Table of Contents        to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.  Contingent Distribution Obligations. In November 2010, BlackRock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of AUM maintained in certain BlackRock products. The initial term of the agreement remained in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement renewed for one automatic three-year extension.  The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table:  Compensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the contractual obligations and commitments table above. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Note 14, Stock-Based Compensation, and Note 15, Employee Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2013 totaled $1,747 million and included incentive compensation of $1,335 million, deferred compensation of $164 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $248 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2014, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years.  Separate Account Liabilities. At December 31, 2013, the Company had $155.1 billion of separate account assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The timing of payments of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.  Consolidation of Sponsored Investment Funds and Securitization Products. Consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products (collectively “investment products”) is determined pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation. The accounting method used by the Company depends upon the influence the Company has over its investee, the investment product. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investment product, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investment product.  For investment products in which BlackRock’s voting interest is less than 50%, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a VIE or a voting rights entity.  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns, to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock continuously evaluates such factors as facts and circumstances change. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary (“PB”).  Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2010-10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds (“ASU 2010-10”) defers the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), for certain investment funds, including money market funds. The PB of a VIE that is an investment fund that meets the conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests, including those of related parties) that absorbs the majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual  returns, or both. The PB of a VIE that does not meet the conditions for deferral in ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE.  Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. If the Company is determined to be the PB of a VIE, BlackRock will consolidate the entity. In order to determine whether the Company is the PB of a VIE for entities that meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of projected future cash flows. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, prepayments, realization of gains, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes.  In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) or CLOs that do not meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10 and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs.     53    Table of Contents      At December 31, 2013, the following balances related to VIEs were included on the consolidated statements of financial condition:                    (in millions)   CLOs     SponsoredPrivateEquity Fund     TotalConsolidatedVIEs     Assets of consolidated VIEs:                  Cash and cash equivalents   $ 156     $ 5     $ 161     Bank loans, bonds, other investments and other assets      2,309        16        2,325     Liabilities of consolidated VIEs:                  Borrowings     (2,369 )      —       (2,369 )    Other liabilities     (74 )      —       (74 )    Appropriated retained earnings     (22 )      —       (22 )    Noncontrolling interests of consolidated VIEs     —       (21 )      (21 )    Total BlackRock net interests in consolidated VIEs   $ —     $ —     $ —      CLOs. At December 31, 2013, BlackRock was the manager of over 20 CLOs/CDOs and other securitization entities. BlackRock was determined to be the PB for certain of these CLOs, which required BlackRock to consolidate these VIEs. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities of the CLOs that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference between the assets and liabilities of the CLOs recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition as the CLO noteholders ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLOs’ assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of these CLOs have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock or its cash flows. Excluding outstanding management receivables, the Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with these VIEs.  Sponsored Private Equity Fund of Funds. At December 31, 2013, BlackRock was determined to be the PB of one investment fund of funds and was deemed to absorb the majority of the variability due to its de-facto related-party relationships with other partners in the fund, which limited the ability of the partners to transfer or sell their interests without BlackRock’s consent as the general partner of the fund. Changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this VIE recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of loss related to its involvement with this VIE.  Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investee.  The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (“ASC 810-20”), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining whether other nonaffiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the   substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, BlackRock will consolidate the investment vehicle.  At December 31, 2013 and 2012, as a result of consolidation of various investment products deemed to be voting rights entities, including products where BlackRock owns 50% or greater of the voting rights of the product, under the consolidation policies described above, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition:                (in millions)   December 31,2013     December 31,2012     Cash and cash equivalents   $ 114     $ 133     Investments:             Trading investments      385        123     Other investments     441       401     Other assets     20       25     Other liabilities     (39 )      (65 )    Noncontrolling interests     (189 )      (187 )    BlackRock’s net interests in consolidated investment funds   $ 732     $ 430    The Company retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to ASC 810. VIEs, including a consolidated sponsored investment fund and CLOs, were excluded from the balances above as the balances of these VIEs are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition.  Investments  Equity Method Investments. For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the     54    Table of Contents        terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity.  BlackRock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for certain strategic investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of BlackRock’s core business.  At December 31, 2013, the Company had $736 million and $163 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2012, the Company had $604 million and $124 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively.  Impairment of Investments. The Company’s management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Company’s carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income.  When the fair value of available-for-sale securities is lower than cost, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered “other-than-temporary”. In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s market value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statement of income. In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) it has the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery or (3) it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Evaluation of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income.  Fair Value Measurements.  Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs. The provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and require companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, for further description of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value.  Significance of Inputs. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.  Valuation Techniques. The fair values of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities were determined using various methodologies as appropriate, including NAVs of underlying investments, third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes and market and income approaches. Such quotes and modeled prices are evaluated for reasonableness through various procedures, including due diligence reviews of third-party pricing vendors, variance analyses, consideration of the current market environment and other analytical procedures. BlackRock’s $574 million of Level 3 investments, or 27% of total GAAP investments at December 31, 2013, primarily included co-investments in private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as alternative hedge funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities and real estate equity products.  As a practical expedient, the Company relies on NAV as the fair value for certain investments. The inputs to value these investments may include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. The various partnerships are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricing/valuation information from third-party sources, including independent appraisals. However, in some instances, current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third-party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third-party sources are not reliable. In these instances, fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used as an input to value these investments.  A significant amount of inputs used to value equity, debt securities and bank loans is sourced from well-recognized third-party pricing vendors. Generally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as Level 2     55    Table of Contents        for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price. Annually, BlackRock’s internal valuation committee or other designated groups review both the valuation methodologies, including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes, and operational processes with these vendors. In addition, on a quarterly basis, meetings are held with key vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors’ processes.  In addition, quotes obtained from brokers generally are non-binding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input.  Changes in Valuation. Changes in value on $1,622 million of investments will impact the Company’s nonoperating income (expense), $183 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $243 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $103 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). At December 31, 2013, changes in fair value of approximately $785 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact BlackRock’s net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was $691 million.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets  The value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2013, ranged from 1 to 11 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 4.3 years.  Goodwill. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment assessment performed as of July 31, 2013 indicated that no impairment charge was required. The Company continuously monitors its book value per share as compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2013, the Company’s common stock closed at $316.47 which exceeded its book value per share of approximately $156.69 after excluding appropriated retained earnings.  Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than its carrying value, BlackRock assesses various significant factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considers other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity’s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs.  If potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.  In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $161 million, $157 million and $156 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments in 2013. The Company determined that no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment.  Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  Significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable     56    Table of Contents        outcomes. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2013, BlackRock had $467 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $304 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.  In accordance with ASC 740, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2013, the Company had deferred tax assets of $4 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $5,085 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company.  ASC 740 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.  At December 31, 2013, the Company had recorded a deferred tax asset of $99 million for unrealized investment losses; however, no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to hold certain investments which invest in fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further details.  The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $89 million and current income taxes payables of $168 million at December 31, 2013.  Revenue Recognition. Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign   exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers.  The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the Company manages. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the Company bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition — Principle Agent Considerations (“ASC 605-45”), and records its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $785 million, $793 million and $928 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income.  The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For 2013, 2012 and 2011, securities lending revenue totaled $447 million, $510 million and $397 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee.  The Company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations, including carried interest allocations, from certain actively managed investment funds and certain SMAs. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. For the years ended 2013, 2012 and 2011, performance fee revenue totaled $561 million, $463 million and $371 million, respectively. In addition, the Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investments upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these funds. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had $108 million and $97 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate recognition of performance fee revenue, if any, for these products is unknown.     57    Table of Contents       Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed or when completed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For 2013, 2012 and 2011, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $577 million, $518 million and $510 million, respectively.  Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  Accounting Developments  For accounting pronouncements that the Company adopted during 2013 and for recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements.  Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  AUM Market Price Risk. BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2013, the majority of the Company’s investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees.  Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval.  In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments.  BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including   real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into swaps to hedge market and interest rate exposure to certain investments. At December 31, 2013, the Company had outstanding total return swaps and interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of approximately $117 million and $71 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2013, approximately $826 million of BlackRock’s total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Company’s economic exposure to its investment portfolio is $1,583 million. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis-Balance Sheet Overview-Investments for further information on the Company’s investments.  The “economic” investment exposure of the portfolio is presented below:  Equity Market Price Risk. At December 31, 2013, the Company’s net exposure to equity market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $828 million of the Company’s total economic investment exposure. Investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments, hedge funds and funds of funds as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $82.8 million in the carrying value of such investments.  Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk. At December 31, 2013, the Company was exposed to interest-rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $755 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $12.7 million in the carrying value of such investments.  Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the pound sterling and euro, was $222 million at December 31, 2013. A 10% adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $22.2 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.  Other Market Risks. The Company executes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange risk movements. At December 31, 2013, the Company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately $792 million.     58    Table of Contents       Item 8. Financial Statements  and Supplemental Data  The report of the independent registered public accounting firm and financial statements listed in the accompanying index are included in Item 15 of this report. See Index to the consolidated financial statements on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.  Item 9. Changes in and  Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure  There have been no disagreements on accounting and financial disclosure matters. BlackRock has not changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years.  Item 9a. Controls and Procedures  Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Under the direction of BlackRock’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, BlackRock evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, BlackRock’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that BlackRock’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the latest fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect such internal control over financial reporting.     59    Table of Contents      Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  Management of BlackRock, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and affected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:        •   pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;        •   provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and        •   provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 based on the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.  The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  February 28, 2014    60    Table of Contents      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BlackRock, Inc.:  We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of BlackRock, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2013 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP  New York, New York  February 28, 2014    61    Table of Contents       Item 9b.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BlackRock, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP  New York, New York  February 28, 2014    F-2    Table of Contents      BlackRock, Inc.

F-9    Table of Contents       BlackRock, Inc.  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation  Business. BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) provides diversified investment management services to institutional clients, intermediary and individual investors through various investment vehicles. Investment management services primarily consist of the management of equity, fixed income, multi-asset, alternative investment and cash management products. BlackRock offers its investment products in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares® exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), collective investment trusts and separate accounts. In addition, BlackRock provides market risk management, financial markets advisory and enterprise investment system services to a broad base of clients. Financial markets advisory services include valuation services relating to illiquid securities, dispositions and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), risk management and strategic planning and execution.  At December 31, 2013, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) held 20.9% of the Company’s voting common stock and 21.9% of the Company’s capital stock, which includes outstanding common and nonvoting preferred stock.  See Note 19, Capital Stock, for more information on the equity ownership of BlackRock.  Basis of Presentation. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition include the portion of consolidated sponsored investment funds in which the Company does not have direct equity ownership. Significant accounts and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Certain items previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  2. Significant Accounting Policies  Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents primarily consists of cash, money market funds and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less in which the Company is exposed to market and credit risk. Cash and cash equivalent balances that are legally restricted from use by the Company are recorded in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Cash balances maintained by consolidated sponsored investment funds are not considered legally restricted and are   included in cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Cash balances maintained by consolidated VIEs are included in assets of consolidated variable interest entities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.  Investments. Investments in Debt and Marketable Equity Securities. BlackRock holds debt and marketable equity investments, which pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320-10, Investments – Debt and Equity Securities, are classified as trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity based on the Company’s intent to sell the security or, for a debt security, the Company’s intent and ability to hold the debt security to maturity.  Trading securities are those investments that are purchased principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change.  Held-to-maturity debt securities are purchased with the positive intent and ability to be held to maturity and are recorded at amortized cost on the consolidated statements of financial condition.  Available-for-sale securities are those securities that are not classified as trading or held-to-maturity. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders’ equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available-for-sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income.  Equity Method. For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC 323, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is recorded as net gain (loss) on investments within nonoperating income (expense) and as other revenue for certain strategic investments since such companies are considered to be an extension of BlackRock’s core business. BlackRock’s share of net income of the investee is recorded based upon the most current information available at the time, which may precede the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition. Distributions received from the investment reduce the Company’s carrying value of the investee and the cost basis if deemed to be a return of capital.  Cost Method. For nonmarketable equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received from the investment are recorded as dividend income within nonoperating income (expense).  Impairments of Investments. The Company’s management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for impairment. If     F-10    Table of Contents        circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Company’s carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income.  When the fair value of available-for-sale securities is lower than cost, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered “other-than-temporary.”  In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s market value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income.  In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) it has the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery or (3) it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Consolidation. For investment products in which BlackRock’s voting interest is less than 50%, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a VIE or a voting rights entity.  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns, to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock continuously evaluates such factors as facts and circumstances change. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the PB.  Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2010-10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds (“ASU 2010-10”), defers the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), for certain investment funds, including money market funds.  The PB of a VIE that does not meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE.  The PB of a VIE that meets the conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests, including those of related parties) that   absorbs the majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both.  Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investee.  The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (“ASC 810-20”), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining whether other nonaffiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or to otherwise remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on an unaffiliated simple majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, BlackRock will consolidate the investment vehicle.  Retention of Specialized Accounting Principles. Upon consolidation of certain sponsored investment funds, the Company retains the specialized accounting principles of the underlying funds pursuant to ASC 810. All of the underlying investments held by such consolidated sponsored investment funds are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the investments’ fair values reflected in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. When the Company no longer controls these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method if the Company still maintains an investment.  Separate Account Assets and Liabilities. Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The life insurance company does not underwrite any insurance contracts that involve any insurance risk transfer from the insured to the life insurance company. The separate account assets primarily include equity securities, debt securities, money market funds and derivatives. The separate account assets are not subject to general claims of the creditors of BlackRock. These separate account assets and the related equal and offsetting liabilities are recorded as separate account assets and separate account liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition in accordance with ASC 944-80, Financial Services – Separate Accounts.   The net investment income attributable to separate account assets supporting individual and group pension contracts accrues directly to the contract owner and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these separate account assets and liabilities, BlackRock earns policy administration and management fees associated with these products, which are included in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income.     F-11    Table of Contents       Separate Account Collateral Assets Held and Liabilities Under Securities Lending Agreements. The Company facilitates securities lending arrangements whereby securities held by separate account assets maintained by BlackRock Life Limited are lent to third parties under global master securities lending agreements. In exchange, the Company receives collateral with minimum values generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the securities lent in order to reduce counterparty risk. The required collateral value is calculated on a daily basis. The global master securities lending agreements provide the Company the right to request additional collateral or, in the event of borrower default, the right to liquidate collateral. Under the Company’s securities lending arrangements, the Company can resell or repledge the collateral and the borrower can resell or repledge the loaned securities. The securities lending transactions entered into by the Company are accompanied by an agreement that entitles the Company to request the borrower to return the securities at any time; therefore, these transactions are not reported as sales under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing.   As a result of the Company’s ability to resell or repledge the collateral, the Company records on the consolidated statements of financial condition the cash and noncash collateral received under these arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. During 2013 and 2012, the Company had not resold or repledged any of the collateral received under these arrangements. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of loaned securities held by separate account assets was approximately $19.7 billion and $21.0 billion, respectively, and the fair value of the collateral held under these securities lending agreements was approximately $21.8 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively.  Deferred Sales Commissions. The Company holds the rights to receive certain cash flows from sponsored mutual funds sold without a front-end sales charge (“back-end load shares”). The carrying value of these deferred mutual fund commissions is recorded within other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition and is being amortized over periods between one and six years. The Company receives distribution fees from these funds and contingent deferred sales commissions (“CDSCs”) upon shareholder redemption of certain back-end load shares that are recorded within distribution fees on the consolidated statements of income. Upon receipt of CDSCs, the Company records revenue and the remaining unamortized deferred sales commission is expensed.  The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of deferred commission assets to determine whether a significant decline in the AUM of these funds or other events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. If indicators of a potential impairment exist, the Company compares the carrying value of the asset to the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows related to the asset. If such assessments indicate that the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows will not be sufficient to recover the remaining carrying value, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value. No such impairments were recorded for 2013, 2012 and 2011.  Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally determined by cost less any   estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term.  BlackRock develops a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services for internal use, utilizing proprietary software that is hosted and maintained by BlackRock. In accordance with ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software (“ASC 350-40”), the Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included within property and equipment on the consolidated statements of financial condition and are amortized, beginning when the software project is put into production, over the estimated useful life of the software of approximately three years.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. In its assessment of goodwill for impairment, the Company considers such factors as the book value and market capitalization of the Company. On a quarterly basis, the Company considers if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a potential goodwill impairment. If a triggering event has occurred, the Company performs assessments, which may include reviews of significant valuation assumptions, to determine if goodwill may be impaired. The Company performs an impairment assessment of its goodwill at least annually, as of July 31st.  Intangible assets are comprised of indefinite-lived intangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets acquired in a business acquisition. The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open-end funds and collective trust funds and certain other commingled products without a specified termination date is generally classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such contracts primarily is based upon the following: (i) the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these products; (ii) the Company expects to, and has the ability to, continue to operate these products indefinitely; (iii) the products have multiple investors and are not reliant on a single investor or small group of investors for their continued operation; (iv) current competitive factors and economic conditions do not indicate a finite life; and (v) there is a high likelihood of continued renewal based on historical experience. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets when they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.  In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. The value of contracts for separately managed accounts (“SMAs”) and certain funds that have finite lives are amortized over the expected lives of the management contracts.  The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. The carrying value of finite-lived management contracts and their remaining useful lives are reviewed at least annually to determine if circumstances exist which may indicate a potential impairment. The Company performs such impairment assessments of its intangible assets     F-12    Table of Contents        including indefinite-lived management contracts and trade names/trademarks, at least annually, as of July 31st. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than its carrying value, BlackRock assesses various significant qualitative factors, including assets under management (“AUM”), revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considers other factors, including (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity’s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs.  If potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.  Noncontrolling Interests. The Company reports noncontrolling interests as equity, separate from the parent’s equity, on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, the Company’s consolidated net income on the consolidated statements of income includes the income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest holders of the Company’s consolidated sponsored investment funds and collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). Income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is not adjusted for income taxes for consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs that are treated as pass-through entities for tax purposes.  Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities. The Company includes redeemable noncontrolling interests related to certain consolidated sponsored investment funds in temporary equity on the consolidated statements of financial condition.  Appropriated Retained Earnings. Upon the initial consolidation of CLOs, BlackRock records an adjustment to appropriated retained earnings on the consolidated statements of financial condition equal to the difference between the fair value of the CLOs’ assets and the fair value of their liabilities. Such amounts are recorded as appropriated retained earnings as the CLO noteholders ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLOs’ assets and liabilities. The net change in the fair value of the CLOs’ assets and liabilities is recorded as net income (loss) attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests and as a change to appropriated retained earnings.  Treasury Stock. The Company records common stock purchased for treasury at cost. At the date of subsequent reissuance, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock using the average cost method.  Revenue Recognition  Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue. Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or committed capital. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers.  The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various mutual fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the Company manages. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund (primarily international funds) takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the Company bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition – Principal Agent Considerations, and records its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $785 million, $793 million and $928 million, respectively, and were reflected net in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income.  The Company also earns revenue by lending securities as an agent on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed.  Investment Advisory Performance Fees. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees or an incentive allocation from certain actively managed investment funds and certain SMAs. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account.  The Company may receive carried interest from certain alternative investments upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments, or cash on the consolidated statements of financial condition to the extent that it is distributed. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had $108 million and $97 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.     F-13    Table of Contents       BlackRock Solutions and Advisory. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, enterprise investment system and financial markets advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions® and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation of illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin® platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. The fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are recorded in BlackRock Solutions and advisory on the consolidated statements of income.  Other Revenue. The Company earns fees for transition management services comprised of commissions from acting as an introducing broker-dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of the Company’s customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur and are reflected in other revenue on the consolidated statements of income.  The Company earns commissions revenue upon the sale of unit trusts and Class A mutual funds. Revenue is recorded at the time of the sale of the product.  Other revenue also includes equity method investment earnings related to certain strategic investments and marketing fees earned for services to distribute iPath® products, which are exchange-traded notes issued by Barclays.  Stock-based Compensation. The Company applies ASC 718-10, Compensation – Stock Compensation (“ASC 718-10”), which establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. Entities are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The compensation cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period) in exchange for the stock-based award.  The Company measures the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) using the Company’s share price on the date of grant. For employee share options and instruments with market conditions, the Company uses pricing models. If an equity award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation cost is recognized for an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. Awards under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans vest over various periods. Compensation cost is recorded by the Company on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award is, in-substance, multiple awards. Compensation cost is reduced by the number of awards expected to be forfeited prior to   vesting. Forfeiture estimates generally are derived using historical forfeiture information, where available, and are reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.  The Company amortizes the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation awards made to retirement-eligible employees over the requisite service period. Upon notification of retirement, the Company accelerates the unamortized portion of the award over the contractually required retirement notification period, if applicable.  Distribution and Servicing Costs. Distribution and servicing costs include payments to third parties, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs are expensed when incurred.  Direct Fund Expenses. Direct fund expenses, which are expensed as incurred, primarily consist of third-party nonadvisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of certain index trademarks, reference data for certain indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund.  Leases. The Company accounts for its operating leases, which may include escalation clauses, in accordance with ASC 840-10, Leases. The Company expenses the lease payments associated with operating leases evenly during the lease term (including rent-free periods) commencing when the Company obtains control over the leased property.  Foreign Exchange. Monetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at exchange rates at the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders’ equity, on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in general and administration expense on the consolidated statements of income. For 2013, 2012 and 2011, the gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions were immaterial.  Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740-10, Income Taxes (“ASC 740-10”). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in consolidated statements of income in the period that includes the enactment date.  Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred income tax assets based upon expected future earnings, taxable income in prior carryback years, future     F-14    Table of Contents        deductibility of the asset, changes in applicable tax laws and other factors. If management determines that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance will be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in additional income tax expense. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax position.  Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation are recognized as additional paid-in capital and are reflected as financing cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows. If the Company does not have additional paid-in capital credits (cumulative tax benefits recorded to additional paid-in capital), the Company will record an expense for any deficit, or shortfall, between the recorded tax benefit and tax return benefit. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, BlackRock had excess additional paid-in capital credits to absorb potential future deficits between recorded tax benefits and tax return benefits.  Earnings per Share (“EPS”). Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed using the treasury stock method.  Due to the similarities in terms between BlackRock’s nonvoting participating preferred stock and the Company’s common stock, the Company considers its nonvoting participating preferred stock to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of EPS calculations. As such, the Company has included the outstanding nonvoting participating preferred stock in the calculation of average basic and diluted shares outstanding.  Prior to 2013, the Company calculated EPS pursuant to the two-class method as defined in ASC 260-10, Earnings per Share (“ASC 260-10”), which specifies that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities and should be included in the computation of EPS. The Company’s participating securities consisted of its unvested share-based payment awards that contained rights to nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents. The dilutive effect of participating securities was calculated under the more dilutive of either the treasury stock method or the two-class method. The Company’s remaining participating securities vested in January 2013.  Business Segments. The Company’s management directs BlackRock’s operations as one business, the asset management business. As such, the Company operates in one business segment as defined in ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280-10”).  Business Combinations. The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with the requirements of ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The fundamental requirement of ASC 805 is that the acquisition method of accounting (the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. The provisions of ASC 805 define the acquirer, establish the acquisition date and define transactions that qualify as business combinations.  Additionally, the requirements of ASC 805 provide guidance for measuring the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, provide guidance for the measurement of fair value in a step acquisition, provide guidance for recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed subject to contingencies, provide guidance on recognition and measurement of contingent consideration and require that acquisition-related costs of the acquirer generally be expensed as incurred. Reversal of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions assumed in business combinations subsequent to the adoption of the requirements of ASC 805, will affect the income tax provision in the period of reversal or change.  Fair Value Measurements.  Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs. The provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and require companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.  Assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:  Level 1 Inputs:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date.        •   Level 1 assets may include listed mutual funds (including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting as these mutual funds are investment companies that have publicly available net asset values (“NAVs”), which in accordance with GAAP, are calculated under fair value measures and the changes in fair values are equal to the earnings of such funds), ETFs, listed equities and certain exchange-traded derivatives.  Level 2 Inputs:  Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from pricing services or brokers for which the Company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price are observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. As a practical expedient, the Company relies on the NAV (or its equivalent) of certain investments as their fair value.        •   Level 2 assets may include debt securities, bank loans, short-term floating-rate notes and asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain equity method limited partnership interests in hedge funds valued based on NAV (or its equivalent) where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term without redemption restrictions, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as over-the-counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts that have inputs to the valuations that generally can be corroborated by observable market data.     F-15    Table of Contents       Level 3 Inputs:  Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include nonbinding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Certain investments that are valued using a NAV (or its equivalent) and are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in Level 3.        •   Level 3 assets may include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds and funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds, bank loans and bonds.        •   Level 3 liabilities include borrowings of consolidated collateralized loan obligations valued based upon nonbinding single-broker quotes.        •   Level 3 inputs include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices.  Significance of Inputs. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.  Valuation Techniques. The fair values of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities were determined using various methodologies as appropriate, including NAVs of underlying investments, third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes and market and income approaches. Such quotes and modeled prices are evaluated for reasonableness through various procedures, including due diligence reviews of third-party pricing vendors, variance analyses, consideration of the current market environment and other analytical procedures.  As a practical expedient, the Company relies on NAV as the fair value for certain investments. The inputs to value these investments may include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. The various partnerships generally are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricing/valuation information from third-party sources, including independent appraisals. However, in some instances, current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third-party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third-party sources are not reliable. In these instances, fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used as an input to value these investments.  A significant amount of inputs used to value equity, debt securities and bank loans is sourced from well-recognized third-party pricing vendors. Generally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for identical   securities traded in active markets and as Level 2 for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price. Annually, BlackRock’s internal valuation committee or other designated groups review both the valuation methodologies, including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes, and operational processes with these vendors. On a quarterly basis, meetings are held with key vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors’ processes.  In addition, quotes obtained from brokers generally are nonbinding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input.  Fair Value Option. ASC 825-10, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825-10”), provides a fair value option election that allows companies an irrevocable election to use fair value as the initial and subsequent accounting measurement attribute for certain financial assets and liabilities. ASC 825-10 permits entities to elect to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an ongoing basis. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. The decision to elect the fair value option is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis, which must be applied to an entire instrument, and not only specified risks, specific cash flows, or portions of that instrument, and is irrevocable once elected. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value pursuant to ASC 825-10 are required to be reported separately from those instruments measured using another accounting method.  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. ASC 815-10, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815-10”), establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. ASC 815-10 generally requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition and to measure those investments at fair value.  The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company may use derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging: (i) exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of certain assets and liabilities, (ii) market exposures for certain seed investments and (iii) future cash flows on floating-rate notes. The Company may also use derivatives within its separate account assets, which are segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. In addition, certain consolidated sponsored investment funds may also invest in derivatives as a part of their investment strategy.  Changes in the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments are generally recognized in earnings and, where applicable, are offset by the corresponding gain or loss on the related foreign-denominated assets or liabilities or hedged investments, on the consolidated statements of income.     F-16    Table of Contents       Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2013  Amendments to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Disclosures. On February 5, 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“ASU 2013-02”), which added new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). See Note 18, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. On December 16, 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (“ASU 2011-11”), which created new disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity’s rights of setoff and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. On January 31, 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (“ASU 2013-01”), that provides clarification about which instruments and transactions are subject to ASU 2011-11. The adoption of ASU 2011-11 and ASU 2013-01 on January 1, 2013 was not material to the consolidated financial statements.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted  Cumulative Translation Adjustment. In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, Parent’s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity (“ASU 2013-05”). ASU 2013-05 addresses the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. ASU 2013-05 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2014. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2013-05 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.  Investment Company Guidance. In June 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-08, Financial Services — Investment Companies: Amendments to the Scope, Measurement, and Disclosure Requirements (“ASU 2013-08”). ASU 2013-08 amends the current criteria for an entity to qualify as an investment company, creates new disclosure requirements and amends the measurement criteria for certain interests in other investment companies. ASU 2013-08 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2014. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2013-08 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.  Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (“ASU 2013-11”). ASU 2013-11 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2014. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2013-11 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.  3.

Equity method investments primarily include BlackRock’s direct investment in certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds. See Note 11, Other Assets, for information on the Company’s investment in PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (“PennyMac”), which is included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition.  Cost method investments include nonmarketable securities, including Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) stock, which is held for regulatory purposes and is restricted from sale. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no indicators of impairment on these investments.  Carried interest represents allocations to BlackRock’s general partner capital accounts from certain funds. These balances are subject to change upon cash distributions, additional allocations or reallocations back to limited partners within the respective funds.     F-18    Table of Contents       4. Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds  The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds primarily because it is deemed to control such funds. The investments owned by these consolidated sponsored investment funds are classified as trading or other investments. The following table presents the balances related to these consolidated funds that were included on the consolidated statements of financial condition as well as BlackRock’s net interest in these funds:                (in millions)   December 31,2013     December 31,2012     Cash and cash equivalents   $ 114     $ 133     Investments:             Trading investments     385       123     Other investments     441       401     Other assets     20       25     Other liabilities     (39 )      (65 )    Noncontrolling interests     (189 )      (187 )    BlackRock’s net interests in consolidated investment funds   $ 732     $ 430      BlackRock’s total exposure to consolidated sponsored investment funds represents the value of its economic ownership interest in these sponsored investment funds. Valuation changes associated with investments held at fair value by these consolidated investment funds are reflected in nonoperating income (expense) and partially offset in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the portion not attributable to BlackRock.  In addition, at December 31, 2013 and 2012, several consolidated CLOs and one sponsored investment fund, which were deemed to be VIEs, were excluded from the balances in the table above as the balances for these investment products are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition. See Note 6, Variable Interest Entities, for further discussion on these consolidated investment products.  The Company may not be readily able to access cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company may not be readily able to sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

In accordance with GAAP, certain equity method investees do not account for both their financial assets and liabilities under fair value measures; therefore, the Company’s investment in such equity method investees may not represent fair value.      (2) Level 3 amounts include $212 million and $54 million of underlying third-party private equity funds and direct investments in private equity companies held by private equity funds, respectively.      (3) Amount includes company-owned and split-dollar life insurance policies.      (4) Level 3 amounts include $20 million and $2 million of underlying third-party private equity funds and direct investments in private equity companies held by a private equity fund.      (5) Amounts include a credit default swap (see Note 7, Derivatives and Hedging, for more information) and securities sold short within consolidated sponsored investment funds.    Level 3 Assets. Level 3 investments of $574 million and $679 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily related to equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds. Level 3 assets within investments, except for direct investments in private equity companies held by private equity funds described below, were primarily valued based upon NAVs received from internal and third-party fund managers.  Direct investments in private equity companies held by private equity funds totaled $28 million and $56 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Direct investments in private equity companies may be valued using the market approach or the income approach, or a combination thereof, and were valued based on an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating evaluation of additional significant third-party financing, changes in valuations of comparable peer companies, the business environment of the companies, market indices, assumptions relating to appropriate risk adjustments for nonperformance and legal restrictions on disposition, among other factors. The fair value derived from the methods used are evaluated and weighted, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range of values indicated. Under the market approach, fair value may be determined by reference to multiples of market-comparable companies or transactions, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) multiples. Under the income approach, fair value may be determined by discounting the expected cash flows to a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. Unobservable inputs used in a  discounted cash flow model may include projections of   operating performance generally covering a five-year period and a terminal value of the private equity direct investment. For securities utilizing the discounted cash flow valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate, risk premium or discount for lack of marketability in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. For securities utilizing the market comparable companies valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease) in the EBITDA multiple in isolation could result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.  Level 3 assets recorded within separate account assets include single-broker nonbinding quotes for fixed income securities and equity securities that have unobservable inputs due to certain corporate actions.  Level 3 assets of consolidated VIEs include bank loans and bonds valued based on single-broker nonbinding quotes and direct private equity investments and private equity funds valued based upon internal as well as third-party fund manager valuations, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices.  Level 3 Liabilities. Level 3 borrowings of consolidated VIEs include CLO borrowings valued based upon single-broker nonbinding quotes.  Level 3 other liabilities include contingent liabilities related to the acquisitions of Credit Suisse’s ETF franchise and MGPA, which were valued based upon discounted cash flow analyses using unobservable market data inputs.

Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) recorded for Level 3 assets and liabilities are reported in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. A portion of net income (loss) for consolidated investments and all of the net income (loss) for consolidated VIEs are allocated to noncontrolling interests to reflect net income (loss) not attributable to the Company.  Transfers in and/or out of Levels. Transfers in and/or out of levels are reflected when significant inputs, including market inputs or performance attributes, used for the fair value measurement become observable/unobservable, or when the Company determines it has the ability, or no longer has the ability, to redeem, in the near term, certain   investments that the Company values using a NAV (or a capital account), or when the carrying value of certain equity method investments no longer represents fair value as determined under valuation methodologies.  Separate Account Assets. In 2012, there were $48 million of transfers of equity securities into Level 3 from Level 1, primarily due to market inputs no longer being considered observable.  In 2012, there were $10 million of transfers out of Level 3 to Level 1 primarily related to equity securities held within separate accounts. The transfers were primarily due to availability of observable market inputs.     F-25    Table of Contents       Assets of Consolidated VIEs. In 2013, there were $159 million of transfers out of Level 3 to Level 2 related to bank loans. In addition, in 2013, there were $117 million of transfers into Level 3 from Level 2 related to bank loans. These transfers in and out of levels were primarily due to availability/unavailability of observable market inputs, including inputs from pricing vendors and brokers.  In 2012, there were $113 million of transfers out of Level 3 to Level 2 related to bank loans. In addition, in 2012, there were $101 million of transfers into Level 3 from Level 2 related to bank loans. The transfers in and out of levels were primarily due to availability/ unavailability of observable market inputs, including inputs from pricing vendors and brokers.  Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds. In 2013, there were $12 million of transfers out of Level 1 to Level 2 related to consolidated private equity funds. These transfers were due to a direct investment in a public company valued at a discount due to restrictions on sale.  Significant Other Settlements. In 2013 and 2012, there were $105 million and $89 million, respectively, of distributions from equity method investees categorized in Level 3.  In 2013, other settlements included $134 million related to a deconsolidation of a consolidated fund of hedge funds, which was previously classified as a VIE. This fund was deconsolidated during the second quarter of 2013 due to the granting of additional substantive rights to unaffiliated investors of the fund.  In 2013, other settlements included $363 million of borrowings of consolidated VIEs related to a consolidation of one additional CLO.  In 2013, there was a $28 million reclassification of a Level 3 investment from a consolidated sponsored investment fund to an equity method investment due to a change in BlackRock’s ownership percentage.  In 2013, issuances and other settlements included $29 million of acquired Level 3 deferred compensation plan equity method investments.  During 2012, other settlements included $1,011 million of proceeds from borrowings of consolidated CLOs.     Disclosures of Fair Value for Financial Instruments Not Held at Fair Value. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments not held at fair value are categorized in the table below:                                December 31, 2013     December 31, 2012          (in millions)   CarryingAmount     EstimatedFair Value     CarryingAmount      Estimated Fair Value     Fair ValueHierarchy     Financial Assets:                            Cash and cash equivalents   $  4,390     $  4,390     $  4,606     $  4,606       Level 1 (1)    Accounts receivable     2,247       2,247       2,250       2,250       Level 1 (2)    Cash and cash equivalents of consolidated VIEs     161       161       297       297       Level 1 (1)           Financial Liabilities:                            Accounts payable and accrued liabilities     1,084       1,084       1,055       1,055       Level 1 (2)    Short-term borrowings     —       —       100       100       Level 1 (2)    Long-term borrowings     4,939       5,284       5,687       6,275       Level 2 (3)       (1) Cash and cash equivalents are carried at either cost or amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, approximately $64 million and $98 million, respectively, of money market funds were recorded within cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Money market funds are valued based on quoted market prices, or $1.00 per share, which generally is the NAV of the fund. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, approximately $114 million and $133 million, respectively, related to cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds.      (2) The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and short-term borrowings approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.      (3) Long-term borrowings are recorded at amortized cost. The fair value of the long-term borrowings, including the current portion of long-term borrowings, is estimated using market prices at the end of December 2013 and 2012, respectively. See Note 12, Borrowings, for the fair value of each of the Company’s long-term borrowings.    F-26    Table of Contents      Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value Per Share  As a practical expedient to value certain investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and have attributes of an investment company, the Company relies on NAV as the fair value. The following table lists information regarding all investments that use a fair value measurement to account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities in their calculation of a NAV per share (or equivalent).

(a) This category includes the underlying third-party private equity funds within consolidated BlackRock sponsored private equity funds of funds. The fair values of the investments in the third-party funds have been estimated using capital accounts representing the Company’s ownership interest in each fund in the portfolio as well as other performance inputs. These investments are not subject to redemption; however, for certain funds, the Company may sell or transfer its interest, which may need approval by the general partner of the underlying funds. Due to the nature of the investments in this category, the Company reduces its investment by distributions that are received through the realization of the underlying assets of the funds. It is estimated that the underlying assets of these funds will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately seven years at both December 31, 2013 and 2012. The total remaining unfunded commitments to other third-party funds were $23 million and $32 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company was contractually obligated to fund $30 million at both December 31, 2013 and 2012 to the consolidated funds.    F-27    Table of Contents        (b) This category includes consolidated funds of hedge funds that invest in multiple strategies to diversify risks. The fair values of the investments have been estimated using the NAV of the fund’s ownership interest in partners’ capital of each fund in the portfolio. Certain of the underlying funds can be redeemed as long as there are no restrictions in place. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the underlying funds that are currently restricted from redemptions within one year will become redeemable in approximately 12 to 24 months. This category also includes a consolidated offshore feeder fund that invests in a master fund with multiple alternative investment strategies. The fair value of this investment has been estimated using the NAV of the master offshore fund held by the feeder fund. The investment is currently subject to restrictions in place by the underlying master fund.      (c) This category includes hedge funds and funds of hedge funds that invest primarily in equities, fixed income securities, distressed credit and mortgage instruments and other third-party hedge funds. The fair values of the investments have been estimated using the NAV of the Company’s ownership interest in partners’ capital. It was estimated that the investments in the funds that are not subject to redemption will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately three and five years at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.      (d) This category includes several private equity funds that initially invest in nonmarketable securities of private companies, which ultimately may become public in the future. The fair values of these investments have been estimated using capital accounts representing the Company’s ownership interest in the funds as well as other performance inputs. The Company’s investment in each fund is not subject to redemption and is normally returned through distributions as a result of the liquidation of the underlying assets of the private equity funds. It was estimated that the investments in these funds will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately five years at both December 31, 2013 and 2012.      (e) This category includes several real estate funds that invest directly in real estate and real estate related assets. The fair values of the investments have been estimated using capital accounts representing the Company’s ownership interest in the funds. A majority of the Company’s investments are not subject to redemption or are not currently redeemable and is normally returned through distributions as a result of the liquidation of the underlying assets of the real estate funds. It is estimated that the investments in these funds not subject to redemptions will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately seven years at December 31, 2013 and eight years at December 31, 2012.      (f) This category includes investments in several real estate funds and certain hedge funds that invest in energy and health science related equity securities. The fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using capital accounts representing the Company’s ownership interest in partners’ capital as well as performance inputs. The investments in hedge funds will be redeemed upon settlement of certain deferred compensation liabilities. The real estate investments are not subject to redemption; however, distributions as a result of the liquidation of the underlying assets will be used to settle certain deferred compensation liabilities over time.      (g) This category includes the underlying third-party private equity funds within one consolidated BlackRock sponsored private equity fund of funds. The fair values of the investments in the third-party funds have been estimated using capital accounts representing the Company’s ownership interest in each fund in the portfolio as well as other performance inputs. These investments are not subject to redemption; however, for certain funds the Company may sell or transfer its interest, which may need approval by the general partner of the underlying third-party funds. Due to the nature of the investments in this category, the Company reduces its investment by distributions that are received through the realization of the underlying assets of the funds. It is estimated that the underlying assets of these funds will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately two years at December 31, 2013 and three years at December 31, 2012. Total remaining unfunded commitments to other third-party funds were not material at both December 31, 2013 and 2012, which commitments are required to be funded by capital contributions from noncontrolling interest holders.      (h) This category includes consolidated offshore feeder funds that invest in master funds with multiple equity strategies to diversify risks. The fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using the NAV of master offshore funds held by the feeder funds. Investments in this category generally can be redeemed at any time, as long as there are no restrictions in place by the underlying master funds.    Fair Value Option. Upon the initial consolidation of certain CLOs, the Company elected to adopt the fair value option provisions for eligible assets and liabilities, including bank loans and borrowings of the CLOs to mitigate accounting mismatches between the carrying value of the assets and liabilities and to achieve operational simplification. To the extent there is a difference between the change in fair value of the assets and liabilities, the difference will be reflected as net income (loss) attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income and offset by a change in appropriated retained earnings on the consolidated statements of financial condition.  The following table summarizes information related to those assets and liabilities selected for fair value accounting at December 31, 2013 and 2012:              (in millions)   December 31,2013     December 31,2012     CLO Bank Loans:             Aggregate principal amounts outstanding   $ 2,181     $ 2,124     Fair value     2,176       2,110     Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value   $ 5     $ 14     Unpaid principal balance of loans more than 90 days past due   $ 14     $ 4     Aggregate fair value of loans more than 90 days past due     9       —     Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for loans more than 90 days past due   $ 5     $ 4     CLO Borrowings:             Aggregate principal amounts outstanding   $ 2,455     $ 2,535     Fair value   $  2,369     $  2,402    At December 31, 2013, the principal amounts outstanding of the borrowings issued by the CLOs mature between 2016 and 2025.  During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the change in fair value of the bank loans and bonds held by the CLOs resulted in a $153 million, a $154 million and a $57 million gain, respectively, which were offset by a $117 million, a $166 million and a $68 million loss, respectively, from the change in fair value of the CLO borrowings.     F-28    Table of Contents       The net gains (losses) were recorded in net gain (loss) on consolidated VIEs on the consolidated statements of income.  The change in fair value of the assets and liabilities included interest income and expense, respectively.  6. Variable Interest Entities  In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”)/CLOs and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs. The Company receives advisory fees and/or other incentive-related fees for its services and may from time to time own equity or debt securities or enter into derivatives with the vehicles, each of which are considered variable interests. The Company enters into these variable interests principally to address client needs through the launch of such investment vehicles. The VIEs are primarily financed via capital contributed by equity and debt holders. The Company’s involvement in financing the operations of the VIEs is generally limited to its equity interests.  In order to determine whether the Company is the PB of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows of the VIEs. Assumptions made in such analyses may include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, prepayments, realization of gains, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, for more information.  Consolidated VIEs. Consolidated VIEs included CLOs in which BlackRock did not have an investment; however, BlackRock, as the collateral manager, was deemed to have both the power to control the activities of the CLOs and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the CLOs. In addition, BlackRock was the PB of one investment fund because it absorbed the majority of the variability due to its de-facto related-party relationships with other   partners in the fund. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company. In addition, the investors in these VIEs have no recourse to the credit of the Company. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the following balances related to VIEs were consolidated on the consolidated statements of financial condition:                (in millions)   December 31,2013     December 31,2012     Assets of consolidated VIEs:             Cash and cash equivalents   $ 161     $ 297     Bank loans      2,176        2,110     Bonds     106       124     Other investments and other assets     43       30     Total bank loans, bonds, other investments and other assets     2,325       2,264     Liabilities of consolidated VIEs:             Borrowings     (2,369 )      (2,402 )    Other liabilities     (74 )      (103 )    Appropriated retained earnings     (22 )      (29 )    Noncontrolling interests of consolidated VIEs     (21 )      (27 )    Total BlackRock net interests in consolidated VIEs   $ —     $ —    During 2013, the Company did not record any nonoperating net income (loss) on consolidated VIEs on the consolidated statements of income. During 2012, the Company recorded a $38 million nonoperating net loss on consolidated VIEs offset by a $38 million net loss attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income. During 2011, the Company recorded an $18 million nonoperating net loss on consolidated VIEs offset by an $18 million net loss attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income.  At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the weighted-average maturity of the bank loans and bonds was approximately 4.7 years and 4.5 years, respectively.     Non-Consolidated VIEs. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company’s carrying value of assets and liabilities and its maximum risk of loss related to VIEs for which it was the sponsor or in which it held a variable interest, but for which it was not the PB, was as follows:                        (in millions)   Variable Interests on the ConsolidatedStatement of Financial Condition          At December 31, 2013   Investments     AdvisoryFeeReceivables     Other NetAssets(Liabilities)     MaximumRisk of Loss(1)     CDOs/CLOs   $ —     $ 1     $ (4 )    $ 18     Other sponsored investment funds:                       Collective trusts     —       184        —       184     Other     37       137       (6 )      174     Total   $  37     $  322     $ (10 )    $  376                         (in millions)   Variable Interests on the ConsolidatedStatement of Financial Condition          At December 31, 2012   Investments     AdvisoryFeeReceivables     Other NetAssets(Liabilities)     MaximumRisk of Loss(1)     CDOs/CLOs   $ 1     $ 1     $ (5 )    $ 19     Other sponsored investment funds:                       Collective trusts     —       248       —       248     Other     17       61       (3 )      77     Total   $  18     $  310     $ (8 )    $  344        (1) At both December 31, 2013 and 2012, BlackRock’s maximum risk of loss associated with these VIEs primarily related to: (i) advisory fee receivables; (ii) BlackRock’s investments; and (iii) $17 million of credit protection sold by BlackRock to a third party in a synthetic CDO transaction.    F-29    Table of Contents       The net assets related to the above CDOs/CLOs and other sponsored investment funds, including collective trusts, that the Company does not consolidate were as follows:  CDOs/CLOs                (in billions)   December 31,2013     December 31,2012     Assets at fair value   $  1     $  4     Liabilities(1)     2       5     Net assets   $ (1 )    $ (1 )       (1) Amounts primarily comprised of unpaid principal debt obligations to CDO/CLO debt holders.  The net assets of other sponsored investment funds that are nonconsolidated VIEs approximated $1.6 trillion to $1.7 trillion at December 31, 2013 and $1.5 trillion to $1.6 trillion at December 31, 2012. Net assets included $1.4 trillion of collective trusts at December 31, 2013 and $1.3 trillion of collective trusts at December 31, 2012. Each collective trust has been aggregated separately and may include collective trusts that invest in other collective trusts. The net assets of these VIEs primarily are comprised of cash and cash equivalents and investments offset by liabilities primarily comprised of various accruals for the sponsored investment vehicles.  7. Derivatives and Hedging  The Company maintains a program to enter into swaps to hedge against market price and interest rate exposures with respect to certain seed investments in sponsored investment products. At December 31, 2013, the Company had outstanding total return swaps and interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of approximately $117 million and $71 million, respectively. At December 31, 2012, the Company had outstanding total return swaps with an aggregate notional value of approximately $206 million.  The Company has entered into a credit default swap, providing credit protection to a counterparty of approximately $17 million, representing the Company’s maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. The Company carries the credit default swap at fair value based on the expected future cash flows under the arrangement.  The fair values of the outstanding total return swaps, interest rate swaps and the credit default swap were not material to the consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2013 and 2012.  The Company executes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange risk movements. At December 31, 2013, the Company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately $792 million and a fair value of approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2012, the aggregate notional value of outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts was approximately $79 million and the fair value was immaterial.  Gains (losses) on total return swaps are recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income and were $(15) million, $(23) million and $4 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Gains (losses) on forward foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded in other general and administration expense on the consolidated statement of income and were $(26) million for 2013. Gains (losses) on forward foreign currency exchange contracts were not material to the consolidated statements of income for 2012 and 2011.  Gains (losses) on the interest rate swaps and the credit default swap were not material to the consolidated statements of income for 2013, 2012 and 2011.  The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds, which may utilize derivative instruments as a part of the funds’ investment strategies. The fair value of such derivatives at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was not material. The change in fair value of such derivatives, which is recorded in nonoperating income (expense), was not material for 2013, 2012 and 2011.  In May 2011, the Company entered into a designated cash flow hedge consisting of a $750 million interest rate swap to hedge future cash flows on the Company’s floating rate notes due in 2013. Interest on this swap was at a fixed rate of 1.03%, payable semi-annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year. During 2013, the interest rate swap matured and the floating rate notes were fully repaid. Gains (losses) on the interest rate swap were not material to the consolidated statements of income for 2013, 2012 and 2011.  8. Property and Equipment  Property and equipment consists of the following:                    (in millions)    Estimated useful life-in years     December 31,        2013     2012     Property and equipment:                  Land     N/A     $ 4     $ 4     Building     39       17       17     Building improvements     15       14       13     Leasehold improvements     1-15       501       482     Equipment and computer software     3       451       465     Other transportation equipment     10       56       56     Furniture and fixtures     7       93       92     Total          1,136       1,129     Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization             611       572     Property and equipment, net           $ 525     $ 557        N/A – Not Applicable  Qualifying software costs of approximately $35 million, $36 million and $37 million have been capitalized within equipment and computer software during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are being amortized over an estimated useful life of three years.  Depreciation and amortization expense was $128 million, $129 million and $138 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.     F-30    Table of Contents       9. Goodwill  Goodwill activity during 2013 and 2012 was as follows:                (in millions)   2013     2012     Beginning of year balance   $ 12,910     $ 12,792     Acquisitions(1)     73       131     Goodwill adjustments related to Quellos and other(2)     (3 )      (13 )    End of year balance   $  12,980     $  12,910        (1) The 2013 amount primarily represents $29 million of goodwill from the Company’s acquisition of MGPA, an independently managed private equity real estate investment advisory company primarily in Asia and Europe, on October 4, 2013 for approximately $66 million (the “MGPA Transaction”) and $44 million of goodwill from the Company’s acquisition of Credit Suisse’s ETF franchise on July 1, 2013 for approximately $273 million (the “Credit Suisse ETF Transaction”). The amount for 2012 represents $106 million of goodwill from the Company’s acquisition of the Canadian exchange-traded products (“ETP”) provider, Claymore Investments, Inc. (the “Claymore Transaction”) on March 7, 2012 for approximately $212 million and $25 million of goodwill from the Company’s acquisition of the European private equity and infrastructure funds of funds franchise of Swiss Re Private Equity Partners (the “SRPEP Transaction”) on September 4, 2012.    (2) The decrease in goodwill during both 2013 and 2012 primarily resulted from a decline of approximately $20 million related to tax benefits realized from tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill from the acquisition of the fund-of-funds business of Quellos Group, LLC in October 2007 (the “Quellos Transaction”). Goodwill related to the Quellos Transaction will continue to be reduced in future periods by the amount of tax benefits realized from tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill from the Quellos Transaction. The balance of the Quellos tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill was approximately $293 million and $324 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In 2012, the decrease in Quellos goodwill was partially offset by a $10 million increase related to the release of the remaining common shares held in escrow in connection with the Quellos Transaction.  The impairment tests performed for goodwill as of July 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 indicated that no impairment charges were required. The Company continuously monitors its book value per share as compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2013, the Company’s common stock closed trading at a price of $316.47 per share, which exceeded its book value per share of approximately $156.69 excluding appropriated retained earnings.     10. Intangible Assets  Intangible assets at December 31, 2013 and 2012 consisted of the following:                        (in millions)   RemainingWeighted-AverageEstimatedUseful Life     Gross CarryingAmount     AccumulatedAmortization     Net CarryingAmount     At December 31, 2013                       Indefinite-lived intangible assets:                       Management contracts     N/A     $ 15,582     $ —     $ 15,582     Trade names / trademarks     N/A       1,403       —       1,403     License     N/A       6       —       6     Total indefinite-lived intangible assets             16,991       —       16,991     Finite-lived intangible assets:                       Management contracts     4.3       1,561       1,054       507     Intellectual property     4.6       6       3       3     Total finite-lived intangible assets     4.3       1,567       1,057       510     Total intangible assets           $ 18,558     $  1,057     $ 17,501     At December 31, 2012                       Indefinite-lived intangible assets:                       Management contracts     N/A     $  15,351     $ —     $  15,351     Trade names / trademarks     N/A       1,403       —       1,403     License     N/A       6       —       6     Total indefinite-lived intangible assets             16,760       —       16,760     Finite-lived intangible assets:                       Management contracts     4.9       1,535       896       639     Intellectual property     5.6       6       3       3     Total finite-lived intangible assets     4.9       1,541       899       642     Total intangible assets           $ 18,301     $ 899     $ 17,402        N/A — Not Applicable    F-31    Table of Contents       The impairment tests performed for intangible assets as of July 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 indicated no impairment charges were required.  Estimated amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets for each of the five succeeding years is as follows:            (in millions)        Year   Amount     2014     $ 156     2015     126     2016     91     2017     74     2018     24    Indefinite-Lived Acquired Management Contracts  In July 2013, in connection with the Credit Suisse ETF Transaction, the Company acquired $231 million of indefinite-lived management contracts.  In March 2012, in connection with the Claymore Transaction, the Company acquired $163 million of indefinite-lived ETP management contracts.  Finite-Lived Acquired Management Contracts  In October 2013, in connection with the MGPA Transaction, the Company acquired $29 million of finite-lived management contracts with a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately eight years.  In September 2012, in connection with the SRPEP Transaction, the Company acquired $40 million of finite-lived management contracts with a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately 10 years.  11. Other Assets  At March 31, 2013, BlackRock held an approximately one-third economic equity interest in Private National Mortgage Acceptance Company, LLC (“PNMAC”), which is accounted for as an equity method investment and is included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. On May 8, 2013, PennyMac became the sole managing member of PNMAC in connection with an initial public offering of PennyMac (the “PennyMac IPO”). As a result of the PennyMac IPO, BlackRock recorded a noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $39 million related to the carrying value of its equity method investment.  Subsequent to the PennyMac IPO, the Company contributed 6.1 million units of its investment to a new donor advised fund (the “Charitable Contribution”). The fair value of the Charitable Contribution was $124 million and is included in general and administration expenses on the consolidated statements of income. In connection with the Charitable Contribution, the Company also recorded a noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the contributed investment and a tax benefit of approximately $48 million.  The carrying value and fair value of the Company’s remaining interest (approximately 20% or 16 million shares and units) was approximately $127 million and $273 million, respectively, at December 31, 2013. The fair value of the Company’s interest reflected the PennyMac stock price at December 31, 2013 (Level 1 input).  12. Borrowings  Short-Term Borrowings  The carrying value of short-term borrowings at December 31, 2012 included $100 million under the 2012 revolving credit facility.  2013 Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2011, the Company entered into a five-year $3.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2011 credit facility”). In March 2012, the 2011 credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date by one year to March 2017 and in April 2012 the amount of the aggregate commitment was increased to $3.785 billion (the “2012 credit facility”). In March 2013, the Company’s credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date by one year to March 2018 and the amount of the aggregate commitment was increased to $3.990 billion (the “2013 credit facility”). The 2013 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2013 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.990 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2013 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2013. The 2013 credit facility provides back-up liquidity, funds ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and funds various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2013, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2013 credit facility.  Commercial Paper Program. On October 14, 2009, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the “CP Program”) under which the Company could issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion. On May 13, 2011, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount that may be borrowed under the CP Program to $3.5 billion. On May 17, 2012, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount to $3.785 billion. In April 2013, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount for which the Company could issue unsecured CP Notes on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.990 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2013 credit facility. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.

In May 2012, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities including $750 million of 1.375% notes maturing in June 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) and $750 million of 3.375% notes maturing in June 2022 (the “2022 Notes”). Net proceeds were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRock’s common stock and Series B Preferred from Barclays and affiliates and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 2015 Notes and the 2022 Notes of approximately $10 million and $25 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, which commenced December 1, 2012.

The “make-whole” redemption price represents a price, subject to the specific terms of the 2015 and 2022 Notes and related indenture, that is the greater of (a) par value and (b) the present value of future payments that will not be paid because of an early redemption, which is discounted at a fixed spread over a comparable Treasury security. The 2015 Notes and 2022 Notes were issued at a discount of $5 million that is being amortized over the term of the notes. The Company incurred approximately $7 million of debt issuance costs, which are being amortized over the respective terms of the 2015 Notes and 2022 Notes. At December 31, 2013, $5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs was included in other assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition.  2013 and 2021 Notes. In May 2011, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities including $750 million of 4.25% notes maturing in May 2021 and $750 million of floating rate notes (“2013 Floating Rate Notes”), which were repaid in May 2013 at maturity.

Interest on the 4.25% notes due in 2021 (“2021 Notes”) is payable semi-annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year, which commenced November 24, 2011, and is approximately $32 million per year. The 2021 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price.

At December 31, 2013, $3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs was included in other assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition.  In May 2011, in conjunction with the issuance of the 2013 Floating Rate Notes, the Company entered into a $750 million notional interest rate swap maturing in 2013 to hedge the future cash flows of its obligation at a fixed rate of 1.03%. During the second quarter of 2013, the interest rate swap matured and the 2013 Floating Rate Notes were fully repaid.  2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes. In December 2009, the Company issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities including $0.5 billion of 2.25% notes, which were repaid in December 2012, $1.0 billion of 3.50% notes and $1.0 billion of 5.0% notes maturing in December 2014 and 2019, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to repay borrowings under the CP Program, which was used to finance a portion of the acquisition of Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”) from Barclays on December 1, 2009 (the “BGI Transaction”), and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes of approximately $35 million and $50 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 10 and December 10 of each year. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. These notes were issued collectively at a discount of $5 million, which is being amortized over the respective terms of the notes. The Company incurred approximately $13 million of debt issuance costs, which are being amortized over the respective terms of these notes.

Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, or approximately $44 million per year. The 2017 Notes may be redeemed prior     F-33    Table of Contents        to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price.

Commitments and Contingencies  Operating Lease Commitments  The Company leases its primary office spaces under agreements that expire through 2035. Future minimum commitments under these operating leases are as follows:            (in millions)        Year   Amount     2014   $ 135     2015     127     2016     110     2017     109     2018     106     Thereafter     699     Total   $  1,286    Rent expense and certain office equipment expense under agreements amounted to $137 million, $133 million and $154 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2013, the Company had $216 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, infrastructure funds, opportunistic funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company, but which are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.  Contingencies  Contingent Payments. The Company acts as the portfolio manager in a series of credit default swap transactions and has a maximum potential exposure of $17 million under a credit default swap between the Company and counterparty. See Note 7, Derivatives and Hedging, for further discussion.  Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with the Credit Suisse ETF Transaction, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments   annually to Credit Suisse, subject to achieving specified thresholds during a seven-year period, subsequent to the acquisition date. In addition, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments related to the MGPA Transaction during a five-year period, subject to achieving specified thresholds, subsequent to the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent payments at December 31, 2013 is not significant to the consolidated statement of financial condition and is included in other liabilities. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. federal, state governmental and domestic and international regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide or other investigations or proceedings. It is BlackRock’s policy to cooperate fully with such inquiries. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Additionally, certain BlackRock-sponsored investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which potentially could harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages.  Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability, if any, arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material effect on BlackRock’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, there is no assurance as to whether any such pending or threatened matters will have a material effect on BlackRock’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows in any future reporting period. Due to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of these matters, management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters.  Indemnifications. In the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, BlackRock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote. Consequently, no liability has been recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition.  In connection with securities lending transactions, BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. At December 31, 2013, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $118.3 billion. The Company held as agent, cash and securities totaling $124.6 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2013. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at December 31, 2013.     F-34    Table of Contents       14. Stock-Based Compensation  The components of stock-based compensation expense are as follows:                        Year ended December 31,     (in millions)    2013     2012     2011     Stock-based compensation:                  Restricted stock and RSUs   $ 415     $ 429     $ 444     Market performance-based RSUs to be funded by PNC     33       15       —     Long-term incentive plans to be funded by PNC     —       7       44     Stock options     —       —       9     Total stock-based compensation   $  448     $  451     $  497    Stock Award and Incentive Plan. Pursuant to the BlackRock, Inc. 1999 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the “Award Plan”), options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price not less than the market value of BlackRock’s common stock on the date of grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock or RSUs may be granted to employees and non-employee directors. A maximum of 27,000,000 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the Award Plan. Of this amount, 3,304,834 shares remain available for future awards at December 31, 2013. Upon exercise of employee stock options, the issuance of restricted stock or the vesting of RSUs, the Company issues shares out of treasury to the extent available.  Restricted Stock and RSUs. Pursuant to the Award Plan, restricted stock grants and RSUs may be granted to certain employees. Substantially all restricted stock and RSUs vest over periods ranging from one to four years and are expensed using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards. Prior to 2009, the Company awarded restricted stock and RSUs with nonforfeitable dividend equivalent rights. Restricted stock and RSUs awarded beginning in 2009 are not considered participating securities for purposes of calculating EPS as the dividend equivalents are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting of the award.  Restricted stock and RSU activity for 2013 is summarized below:                Outstanding at   RestrictedStock andUnits     WeightedAverageGrant DateFair Value     December 31, 2012     5,620,835     $ 197.90     Granted     1,660,532     $ 234.75     Converted     (2,588,637 )    $ 204.09     Forfeited     (79,917 )    $ 204.12     December 31, 2013(1)     4,612,813     $ 207.94        (1) At December 31, 2013, approximately 4.4 million awards are expected to vest and 0.2 million awards have vested but have not been converted.  The Company values restricted stock and RSUs at their grant-date fair value as measured by BlackRock’s common stock price. The total fair market value of RSUs granted to employees during 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $390 million, $348 million and $477 million, respectively. The total fair market value of RSUs converted to common stock during 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $528 million, $297 million and $553 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2013, the intrinsic value of outstanding RSUs was $1.5 billion, reflecting a closing stock price of $316.47 at December 31, 2013.  The awards granted under the Award Plan primarily related to the following:  2011        •   1,594,259 RSUs to employees as part of annual incentive compensation that vest ratably over three years from the date of grant; and        •   609,733 RSUs to employees that cliff vest 100% on January 31, 2014.  2012         •   1,365,691 RSUs to employees as part of annual incentive compensation that vest ratably over three years from the date of grant; and        •   418,038 RSUs to employees that cliff vest 100% on January 31, 2015.  2013         •   1,172,381 RSUs to employees as part of annual incentive compensation that vest ratably over three years from the date of grant; and        •   370,812 RSUs to employees that cliff vest 100% on January 31, 2016.  At December 31, 2013, there was $250 million in total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 0.7 years.  2014  In January 2014, the Company granted the following awards under the Award Plan:        •   1,022,295 RSUs to employees as part of annual incentive compensation that vest ratably over three years from the date of grant; and        •   287,963 RSUs to employees that cliff vest 100% on January 31, 2017.  Market Performance-based RSUs. Pursuant to the Award Plan, market performance-based RSUs may be granted to certain employees. The market performance-based RSUs require that separate 15%, 25% and 35% share price appreciation targets be achieved during the six-year term of the awards. The awards are split into three tranches and each tranche may vest if the specified target increase in share price is met. Eligible delivery dates for each tranche are the fourth, fifth or sixth anniversaries of the grant date. Certain awards are forfeited if the employee leaves BlackRock before the vesting date. These awards are amortized over a service period of four years, which is the longer of the explicit service period or the period in which the market target is expected to be met. Market performance-based RSUs are not considered participating securities as the dividend equivalents are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting of the award. In 2013, the Company granted market performance-based RSUs, which will be funded primarily by shares currently held by PNC (see Long-Term Incentive Plans Funded by PNC below).     F-35    Table of Contents       Market performance-based RSU activity for 2013 is summarized below:                Outstanding at   MarketPerformance-Based RSUs     WeightedAverageGrant DateFair Value     December 31, 2012      575,532     $ 115.03     Granted     556,581     $ 126.76     December 31, 2013(1)     1,132,113     $  120.80        (1) At December 31, 2013, approximately 1.1 million awards are expected to vest and no awards have vested and have been converted.  At December 31, 2013, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested market performance-based awards was $88 million. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 2.6 years.  The grant-date fair value of the awards was $71 million in both 2013 and 2012. The fair value was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation with the following assumptions:                         Grant Year   Risk-FreeInterestRate     PerformancePeriod     ExpectedStockVolatility     ExpectedDividendYield     2012     1.21 %      6       33.63 %      2.99 %    2013     1.05 %      6       25.85 %      2.89 %   The Company’s expected stock volatility assumption was based upon an average of the historical stock price fluctuations of BlackRock’s common stock and an implied volatility at the grant date. The dividend yield assumption was derived using estimated dividends over the expected term and the stock price at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield at date of grant.  In January 2014, the Company granted 315,961 market performance-based RSUs under the Award Plan.  Long-Term Incentive Plans Funded by PNC. Under a share surrender agreement, PNC committed to provide up to 4 million shares of BlackRock stock, held by PNC, to fund certain BlackRock long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”). The current share surrender agreement commits PNC to provide BlackRock series C nonvoting participating preferred stock to fund the remaining committed shares. As of December 31, 2012, 2.5 million shares had been surrendered by PNC. In January 2013, 0.2 million additional shares were surrendered.  At December 31, 2013, the remaining shares committed by PNC of 1.3 million were available to fund future long-term incentive awards.  Stock Options. Stock option grants were made to certain employees pursuant to the Award Plan in 1999 through 2007. Options granted have a ten-year life, vested ratably over periods ranging from two to five years and became exercisable upon vesting. The Company has not granted any stock options subsequent to the January 2007 grant, which vested on September 29, 2011. Stock option activity for 2013 is summarized below:                Outstanding at   Sharesunderoption     Weightedaverageexerciseprice     December 31, 2012     1,099,909     $ 167.76     Exercised     (168,151 )    $ 167.76     December 31, 2013(1)     931,758     $  167.76        (1) At December 31, 2013, all options were vested.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase the Company’s common stock at 95% of the fair market value on the last day of each three-month offering period. In accordance with ASC 718-10, Compensation–Stock Compensation, the Company does not record compensation expense related to employees purchasing shares under the ESPP.  15. Employee Benefit Plans  Deferred Compensation Plans  Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan. The Company adopted a Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan (“VDCP”) that allows participants to elect to defer between 1% and 100% of their annual cash incentive compensation. The participants must specify a deferral period of up to 10 years from the year of deferral. The Company funds the obligation through the establishment of a rabbi trust on behalf of the plan’s participants.     F-36    Table of Contents       The rabbi trust established for the VDCP, with assets totaling $65 million and $59 million December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is reflected in investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Such investments are classified as trading and other investments. The corresponding liability balance of $64 million and $60 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as accrued compensation and benefits. Earnings in the rabbi trust, including unrealized appreciation or depreciation, are reflected as nonoperating income (expense) and changes in the corresponding liability are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income.  Other Deferred Compensation Plans. The Company has additional compensation plans for the purpose of providing deferred compensation and retention incentives to certain employees. For these plans, the final value of the deferred amount to be distributed in cash upon vesting is associated with investment returns of certain investment funds. The liabilities for these plans were $100 million and $77 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition as accrued compensation and benefits. In January 2014, the Company granted approximately $100 million of additional deferred compensation that will fluctuate with investment returns and will vest ratably over three years from the date of grant.  Defined Contribution Plans  BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan. Certain of the Company’s employees participate in the BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan (“BRSP”). Employee contributions of up to 8% of eligible compensation, as defined by the plan and subject to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) limitations, are matched by the Company at 50%. In addition, the Company will continue to make an annual retirement contribution to eligible participants equal to 3-5% of eligible compensation. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company’s expense related to the BRSP was $63 million, $59 million and $43 million, respectively.  BlackRock Group Personal Pension Plan. BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited (“BIM”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, contributes to the BlackRock Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution plan for all employees of BIM. BIM contributes between 6% and 15% of each employee’s eligible compensation. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company’s expense related to this plan was $29 million, $27 million and $26 million, respectively.  Defined Benefit Plans. The Company has several defined benefit pension plans in Japan and Germany. All accrued benefits under the Germany defined benefit plan are currently frozen and the plan is closed to new participants. The participant benefits under the Germany plan will not change with salary increases or additional years of service. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the plan assets for these plans were approximately $22 million and $21 million, respectively. The overfunded obligations at December 31, 2013 and the underfunded obligation at December 31, 2012 were not material. Benefit payments for the next five years and in aggregate for the five years thereafter are not expected to be material.  The plan assets for the defined benefit plan in Japan (the “Japan Plan”) are invested using a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity securities, debt securities   and other investments are used to preserve asset values, diversify risk and achieve the target investment return benchmark. Investment strategies and asset allocations are based on consideration of plan liabilities and the funded status of the plan. Investment performance and asset allocation are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis. The current target allocations for the plan assets are 22% for U.S. and international equity securities, 76% for U.S. and international fixed income securities and 2% for other. The table below provides the fair value of the plan assets of the Japan Plan at December 31, 2013 and 2012 by asset category and identifies the level of inputs used to determine the fair value of assets in each category.

For 2013, 2012 and 2011, expenses for these benefits were not material.  16. Related Party Transactions  Determination of Related Parties  PNC. The Company considers PNC, along with its affiliates, to be related parties based on the level of its ownership of BlackRock capital stock. At December 31, 2013, PNC owned approximately 20.9% of the Company’s voting common stock and held approximately 21.9% of the total capital stock.

Net Capital Requirements  The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.  Banking Regulatory Requirements. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is chartered as a national bank whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Under the capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, BTC must meet specific capital guidelines that invoke quantitative measures of BTC’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under the regulatory accounting practices. BTC’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.  Quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy require BTC to maintain a minimum Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 leverage ratio, as well as Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios. Based on BTC’s calculations as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, it exceeded the applicable capital adequacy requirements.

A reconciliation of income tax expense with expected federal income tax expense computed at the applicable federal income tax rate of 35% is as follows:                                (in millions)   2013     %     2012     %     2011     %     Statutory income tax expense   $ 1,383       35 %    $ 1,221       35 %    $  1,097       35 %    Increase (decrease) in income taxes resulting from:                                 State and local taxes (net of federal benefit)     39       1       49       2       59       2     Impact of foreign, state, and local tax rate changes on deferred taxes     (69 )      (2 )      (50 )      (2 )      (188 )      (6 )    Effect of foreign tax rates     (329 )      (8 )      (221 )      (5 )      (197 )      (6 )    Other     (2 )      —       31       —       25       —     Income tax expense   $  1,022       26 %    $  1,030       30 %    $ 796       25 %     Deferred income taxes are provided for the effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years.       F-43    Table of Contents       The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities are shown below:                    December 31,    (in millions)   2013     2012     Deferred income tax assets:             Compensation and benefits   $ 345     $ 355     Unrealized investment losses     99       71     Loss carryforwards     42       81     Foreign tax credit carryforwards     28       —     Other     290       222     Gross deferred tax assets     804       729     Less: deferred tax valuation allowances     (48 )      (95 )    Deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances     756       634     Deferred income tax liabilities:             Goodwill and acquired indefinite-lived intangibles     5,594       5,656     Acquired finite-lived intangibles     110       158     Other     133       109     Gross deferred tax liabilities      5,837        5,923     Net deferred tax (liabilities)   $ (5,081 )    $ (5,289 )   Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded net when related to the same tax jurisdiction. At December 31, 2013, the Company recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition deferred income tax assets, within other assets, and deferred income tax liabilities of $4 million and $5,085 million, respectively. At December 31, 2012, the Company recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition deferred income tax assets, within other assets, and deferred income tax liabilities of $4 million and $5,293 million, respectively.  During 2013, tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and domestic state tax law changes resulted in a $69 million net noncash benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities. During 2012, tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure primarily resulted in a $50 million net noncash benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities.  The Company had a deferred income tax asset related to unrealized investment losses of approximately $99 million and $71 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, reflecting the Company’s conclusion that based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. U.S. Federal realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes. The Company expects to hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and to generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses.  At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had available state net operating loss carryforwards of $935 million and $842 million, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2017. At December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $109 million and $152 million, respectively, of which $11 million will begin to expire in 2017 and the balance will carry forward   indefinitely. At December 31, 2013, the Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of $28 million which will begin to expire in 2023.  At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had $48 million and $95 million of valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets, respectively, recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The year-over-year decrease in the valuation allowance primarily related to the realization of tax loss carryforwards and certain foreign deferred income tax assets.  Goodwill recorded in connection with the Quellos Transaction has been reduced during the period by the amount of tax benefit realized from tax-deductible goodwill. See Note 9, Goodwill, for further discussion.  Current income taxes are recorded net on the consolidated statements of financial condition when related to the same tax jurisdiction. At December 31, 2013, the Company had current income taxes receivable and payable of $89 million and $168 million, respectively, recorded in other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively. At December 31, 2012, the Company had current income taxes receivable and payable of $102 million and $121 million, respectively, recorded in other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively.  The Company does not provide deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting over tax basis on its investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. The excess totaled $3,074 million and $2,125 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The determination of the additional deferred income taxes on the excess has not been provided because it is not practicable due to the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.  The following tabular reconciliation presents the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits:                        Year ended December 31,    (in millions)    2013     2012     2011     Balance at January 1   $ 404     $ 349     $ 307     Additions for tax positions of prior years     11       4       22     Reductions for tax positions of prior years     (5 )      (1 )      (1 )    Additions based on tax positions related to current year     67       69       46     Lapse of statute of limitations     —       —       —     Settlements     (12 )      (29 )      (25 )    Positions assumed in acquisitions     2       12       —     Balance at December 31   $  467     $  404     $  349    Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, are $304 million, $250 million and $226 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, the Company accrued interest and penalties of $(1) million during 2013 and in total, as of December 31, 2013, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $68 million. The Company accrued interest and penalties of     F-44    Table of Contents        $3 million during 2012 and in total, as of December 31, 2012, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $69 million. The Company accrued interest and penalties of $10 million during 2011 and in total, as of December 31, 2011, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $66 million. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company has been indemnified by Barclays for $50 million and Guggenheim for $6 million of unrecognized tax benefits.  BlackRock is subject to U.S. federal income tax, state and local income tax, and foreign income tax in multiple jurisdictions. Tax years after 2007 remain open to U.S. federal income tax examination. The IRS is in the process of concluding its audit of the 2008 and 2009 years and its case must be approved by The Joint Committee on Taxation. The BGI group’s tax years 2007 through December 1, 2009 are under IRS examination. The IRS is in the process of concluding its audit and its case must be approved by The Joint Committee on Taxation.  The Company is currently under audit in several state and local jurisdictions. The significant state and local income tax examinations are in California for tax years 2009 through 2010, New York State and New York City for tax years 2009 through 2011, and New Jersey for tax years 2007 through 2009. No state and local income tax audits cover years earlier than 2007. No state and local income tax audits are expected to result in an assessment material to BlackRock’s consolidated financial statements.  Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) commenced its United Kingdom income tax audit of various U.K. BlackRock subsidiaries in respect of 2009 through 2011 tax years. While the impact on the consolidated financial statements is undetermined, it is not expected to be material.  At December 31, 2013, it is reasonably possible the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change within the next twelve months due to completion of tax authorities’ exams or the expiration of statues of limitations. Management estimates that the existing liability for uncertain tax positions could decrease by approximately $110 million to $135 million within the next twelve months.  22.

For 2012 and 2011, average outstanding participating securities were 0.2 million and 1.8 million, respectively.  For 2012 and 2011, 449 and 5,125 RSUs, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because to include them would have an anti-dilutive effect. There were no anti-dilutive RSUs for 2013. In addition, there were no anti-dilutive stock options for 2013, 2012 and 2011.  23.

      "RISK FACTORS   The following discussion sets forth certain risks that the Company believes could cause its actual future results to differ materially from expected results.   Economic conditions. The profitability of Citigroup's businesses may be affected by global and local economic conditions, such as the liquidity of the global financial markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and equity prices, investor sentiment, inflation, and the availability and cost of credit.   The Company generally maintains large trading portfolios in the fixed income, currency, commodity and equity markets and has significant investment positions, including investments held by its private equity business. The revenues derived from the values of these portfolios are directly affected by economic conditions.   The credit quality of Citigroup's on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures is also affected by economic conditions, as more loan delinquencies would likely result in a higher level of charge-offs and increased provisions for credit losses, adversely affecting the Company's earnings. The Company's consumer businesses are particularly affected by factors such as prevailing interest rates, the rate of unemployment, the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies.   Credit, market and liquidity risk. As discussed above, the Company's earnings may be impacted through its market risk and credit risk positions and by changes in economic conditions. In addition, Citigroup's earnings are dependent upon the extent to which management can successfully manage its positions within the global markets. In particular environments, the Company may not be able to mitigate its risk exposures as effectively as desired, and may have unwanted exposures to certain risk factors.   The Company's earnings are also dependent upon its ability to properly value financial instruments. In certain illiquid markets, judgmental estimates of value may be required. The Company's earnings are also dependent upon how effectively it assesses the cost of credit and manages its portfolio of risk concentrations. In addition to the direct impact of the successful management of these risk factors, management effectiveness is taken into consideration by the rating agencies, which determine the Company's own credit ratings and thereby establish the Company's cost of funds.   Competition. Merger activity in the financial services industry has produced companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices. Globalization of the capital markets and financial services industries exposes Citigroup to competition both at the global and local level. In addition, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. Citigroup's ability to grow its businesses, and therefore its earnings, is affected by these competitive pressures.   Country risk. Citigroup's international revenues are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, currency fluctuations, social instability, and changes in governmental policies, including expropriation, nationalization, international ownership legislation, and tax policies. In addition, revenues from the trading of international securities and investment in international securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated because certain international trading markets, particularly those in emerging market countries, are typically smaller, less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets.   For geographic distributions of net income, see page 17. For a discussion of international loans, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 126 and \"Country and Cross-Border Risk Management Process\" on page 75.   Operational risk. Citigroup is exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical and record-keeping errors, and computer/telecommunications systems malfunctions. Given the high volume of transactions at Citigroup, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified. In addition, the Company's necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. The Company may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (for example, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, epidemics, computer viruses, and electrical/ telecommunications outages), which may give rise to losses in service to customers and/or monetary loss to the Company. All of these risks are also applicable where the Company relies on outside vendors to provide services to it and its customers.   U.S. fiscal policies. The Company's businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal policies adopted by regulatory authorities of the United States. For example, in the United States, policies of the Federal Reserve Board directly influence the rate of interest paid by commercial banks on their interest-bearing deposits and also may affect the value of financial instruments held by the Company. In addition, such changes in fiscal policy may affect the credit quality of the Company's customers. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board directly impact the Company's cost of funds for lending, capital raising and investment activities.   Reputational and legal risk. Various issues may give rise to reputational risk and cause harm to the Company and its business prospects. These issues include appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest; legal and regulatory requirements; ethical issues; money laundering laws; privacy laws; information security policies; and sales and trading practices. Failure to address these issues appropriately could also give rise to additional legal risk to the Company, which could increase the number of litigation claims and the amount of damages asserted against the Company, or subject the Company to regulatory enforcement actions, fines and penalties.  56       Certain regulatory considerations. As a worldwide business, Citigroup and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation, new legislation and changing accounting standards and interpretations thereof. Legislation is introduced, including tax legislation, from time to time in Congress, in the states and in foreign jurisdictions that may change banking and financial services laws and the operating environment of the Company and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. The Company cannot determine whether such legislation will be enacted and the ultimate effect that would have on the Company's results.  57      MANAGING GLOBAL RISK\n"
