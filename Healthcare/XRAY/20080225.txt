Item 1A. Risk Factors    Following are the significant risk factors that could materially impact DENTSPLY’s business. The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate its relative importance or priority.    Negative changes could occur in the dental markets, the general economic environments, or government reimbursement or regulatory programs of the regions in which the Company operates.    The success of the Company is largely dependent upon the continued strength of dental markets and is also somewhat dependent upon the general economic environments of the regions in which it operates. Negative changes to these markets and economies could materially impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of the Company's markets are affected by government reimbursement and regulatory programs. In certain markets, government and regulatory programs have a more significant impact than other markets. Changes to these programs could have a positive or negative impact on the Company's results.    The Company may be unable to develop innovative products or obtain regulatory approval for new products.    DENTSPLY has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities. There can be no assurance that DENTSPLY will be able to continue to develop innovative products and that regulatory approval of any new products will be obtained, or that if such approvals are obtained, such products will be favorably accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors’ new products will not be introduced that could render the Company's products obsolete.    The dental supplies market is highly competitive, and there is no guarantee that the Company can compete successfully.    The worldwide market for dental supplies is highly competitive. There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and market new products successfully, or that new products and technologies introduced by competitors will not render the Company's products obsolete or noncompetitive. Additionally, the size and number of the Company's competitors vary by product line and from region to region. There are many companies that produce some, but not all, of the same types of products as those produced by the Company. Certain of DENTSPLY's competitors may have greater resources than does the Company.    The Company’s expansion through acquisition involves risks and may not result in the expected benefits.    The Company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy. The Company continues to be active in evaluating potential acquisitions although there is no assurance that these efforts will result in completed transactions as there are many factors that affect the success of such activities. If the Company does succeed in acquiring a business or product, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management’s attention from normal business operations. If the Company makes acquisitions, it may incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses, any of which might adversely affect its financial results. Any financing that the Company might need for acquisitions may only be available to it on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results.    The Company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt, pay its contractual obligations and operate the business.    DENTSPLY's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations, and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control. Although Management believes that the Company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity, there can be no assurance that DENTSPLY's business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt, pay its contractual obligations and operate its business.    The Company may be unable to sustain the operational and technical expertise that is key to its success.    DENTSPLY believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success. The manufacture of the Company's products requires substantial and varied technical expertise. Complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the Company's products. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain the necessary operational and technical expertise that is key to its success.       8     The Company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that cross default provisions are triggered due to a breach of loan covenants.    DENTSPLY's existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy. The most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions, maintenance of certain levels of net worth, and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense. Any breach of any such covenants or restrictions would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and, through cross default provisions, would entitle DENTSPLY's other lenders to accelerate their loans. DENTSPLY may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provision is triggered.    The Company’s international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect the operating results.    DENTSPLY, with its significant international operations, is subject to fluctuations in exchange rates of various foreign currencies and other risks associated with foreign trade and the impact of currency fluctuations in any given period can be favorable or unfavorable.    The Company may fail to comply with regulations issued by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies.    DENTSPLY's business is subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA and similar foreign authorities to monitor DENTSPLY's compliance with the regulations administered by such authorities. There can be no assurance that these authorities will not raise compliance concerns. Failure to satisfy any such requirements can result in governmental enforcement actions, including possible product seizure, injunction and/or criminal or civil proceedings.    All dental amalgam filling materials, including those manufactured and sold by DENTSPLY, contain mercury. The FDA's Dental Devices Classification Panel, the National Institutes of Health and the United States Public Health Service have each indicated that no direct hazard to humans from exposure to dental amalgams has been demonstrated. If the FDA were to reclassify dental mercury and amalgam filling materials as classes of products requiring FDA pre-market approval, there can be no assurance that the required approval would be obtained or that the FDA would permit the continued sale of amalgam filling materials pending its determination.    The Company may be unable to obtain a supply for certain finished goods purchased from third parties.    A significant portion of the Company’s injectable anesthetic products, orthodontic products and cutting instruments are purchased from a limited number of suppliers. As there are a limited number of suppliers for these products, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products in the future.    The Company's success is dependent upon its management and employees.    The Company's success is dependent upon its management and employees. The loss of senior management employees or any failure to recruit and train needed managerial, sales and technical personnel, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.    The Company faces the inherent risk of litigation.    The Company’s business involves a risk of product liability and other claims, and from time to time the Company is named as a defendant in these cases. The primary risks to which the Company is exposed are related to those products manufactured by the Company. The Company has insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate; however, the Company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. A successful claim brought against the Company in excess of available insurance, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against the Company, could harm its business. Various parties, including the Company, own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental field. Although the Company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property rights, it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the Company’s products infringe upon such party’s intellectual property and force the Company to discontinue the sale of certain products.       9     The Company may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause its stock price to decline.    DENTSPLY experiences fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, the Company may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause its stock price to decline. The Company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations with net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters. The Company typically implements most of its price changes in the third or fourth quarters of the year. These price changes, other marketing and promotional programs, which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business, the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives, may impact sales levels in a given period. Net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters, primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding the first and third quarters, but also due to the impact of summer holidays and vacations, particularly throughout Europe.    The market price for the Company’s common stock may become volatile.    A variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of DENTSPLY’s common stock causing volatility. These factors include, but are not necessarily limited to: the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community; changes in the Company’s industry and competitors; the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; any future issuances of DENTSPLY’s common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in connection with business acquisitions, restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time; general market and economic conditions; and any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas the Company does business.    In addition, the NASDAQ National Market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on the NASDAQ. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the Company’s common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which would harm the Company’s business.    Certain provisions in the Company’s governing documents may discourage third-party offers to acquire DENTSPLY that might otherwise result in the Company’s stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.    Certain provisions of DENTSPLY's Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and of Delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of DENTSPLY. Such provisions include the division of the Board of Directors of DENTSPLY into three classes, with the three-year term of a class expiring each year, a provision allowing the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend DENTSPLY's By-laws and call special meetings of stockholders. In addition, members of DENTSPLY's management and participants in its Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) collectively own approximately 5% of the outstanding common stock of DENTSPLY.  The Company is exposed to the risk of changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.    The Company’s balance sheet includes debt and net investment hedges that are sensitive to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates. Changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the Company’s statement of income.         ITEM 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments
