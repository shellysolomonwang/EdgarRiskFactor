Item 1A: Risk Factors  The risks described below could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. These risks are not the only risks that the Company faces. The Company’s business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to it or that the Company currently considers not to be material to its operations.  Competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company operates in markets that are highly competitive. Its pharmaceutical supply chain business competes with two national, full-line wholesale distributors, McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and a number of smaller regional wholesale distributors, self-warehousing chains, direct selling manufacturers, specialty distributors, generic pharmaceutical telemarketing distributors and third-party logistics companies, among others. The Company’s medical products distribution and manufacturing businesses encounter competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of their businesses. As a result, the Company’s businesses face continued pricing pressure from their customers. In some cases, the Company is able to offset these reductions by lowering its costs through effective product sourcing and focus on cost controls. If the Company is unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures, its results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, in recent years, the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. If this consolidation trend continues among the Company’s customers and vendors, it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may further increase pressure on prices for the Company’s products and services.  Substantial defaults or a material reduction in purchases of the Company’s products by large customers could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  In recent years, a significant portion of the Company’s revenue growth has been derived from a limited number of large customers. The Company’s largest customers, CVS and Walgreens, accounted for approximately 22% and 19%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue for fiscal 2008. The aggregate of the Company’s five largest customers, including CVS and Walgreens, accounted for approximately 52% of the Company’s revenue for fiscal 2008. In addition, CVS and Walgreens accounted for 19% and 26%, respectively, of the Company’s gross trade receivable balance at June 30, 2008. As a result, the Company’s sales and credit concentration is significant. Any defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases from these or other large customers could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, certain of the Company’s businesses have entered into agreements with GPOs. Approximately 16% of the Company’s revenue for fiscal 2008 was derived from GPO members through the contractual arrangements established with Novation and Premier. Generally, compliance by GPO members with GPO vendor selections is voluntary. Still, the loss of an agreement with a GPO could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition because the Company could lose customers or have to reduce prices as a result.  Changes in the U.S. healthcare environment could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company’s products and services are primarily intended to function within the current structure of the healthcare industry in the United States. In recent years, the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an     16    Table of Contents  effort to reduce costs. These changes include increased use of managed care, cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply distributors, and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups.  The Company expects the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these changes, such as adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services, legislation or regulations governing the privacy of patient information, or changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of the Company’s products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for such products and services. Changes in the healthcare industry’s or in any of the Company’s suppliers’ pricing, reimbursement, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices, or changes in the Company’s customer mix, could also significantly reduce the Company’s revenue, increase the Company’s costs or otherwise significantly affect its results of operations.  Generic pharmaceuticals. Healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic pharmaceuticals will increase over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain pharmaceutical patents. A decrease in the availability or changes in pricing of or reimbursements for generic pharmaceuticals could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  Prescription drug pedigree tracking. There have been increasing efforts by various levels of government agencies, including state departments of health, state boards of pharmacy and comparable government agencies, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, diverted, adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. Several states have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations, including pedigree tracking requirements, that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain. These laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the Company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business, and could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. See “Item 1—Business—Regulatory Matters” above for more information regarding prescription drug pedigree tracking.  Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The DRA changed the federal upper payment limit for Medicaid reimbursement from 150% of the lowest published price for generic pharmaceuticals (which is usually the average wholesale price) to 250% of the AMP and requires manufacturers to publicly report AMP for branded and generic pharmaceuticals. Recently enacted legislation has delayed the implementation of these changes until October 1, 2009. The Company expects the use of an AMP benchmark to result in a reduction in the Medicaid reimbursement rates to its customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals, which may indirectly impact the prices that the Company can charge its customers for generic pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in the Company’s gross margin. There can be no assurance that the changes in the reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the DRA will not have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. See “Item 1—Business—Regulatory Matters” above for more information regarding the DRA.  Direct purchase policies. Some manufacturers have adopted policies attempting to limit the ability of wholesalers, including the Healthcare Supply Chain Services—Medical segment’s businesses, to purchase products from anyone other than the manufacturer. If manufacturers are successful in implementing these policies in the future, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to negotiate satisfactory fee-based or other compensation arrangements with these manufacturers to mitigate the lost gross margin opportunity. See “Item 1—Business—Suppliers” above for more information regarding direct purchase policies.  The Company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business is subject to appreciation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices, which subjects the Company to risks and uncertainties.  The Company continues to generate a portion of its gross margin from the sale of some manufacturers’ products from pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution service agreement fees. For these     17    Table of Contents  manufacturers, a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases, as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to the Company, could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the pharmaceutical supply chain business distributes generic pharmaceuticals, which are generally subject to price deflation. An increase in the rate and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical price deflation could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company is involved in legal proceedings that could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings, certain of which are discussed in Note 12 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” Litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur. It is possible that cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies.  In addition, the Company’s products and services expose it to product and professional liability risks. The availability of product liability insurance for large companies in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry is generally more limited than insurance available to smaller companies and companies in other industries. Insurance carriers providing product liability insurance to large pharmaceutical and medical device companies generally limit the amount of available policy limits, require larger self-insured retentions and include exclusions for certain products. Large self-insured retentions may also apply to certain professional liability risks. There can be no assurance that a successful product or professional liability claim would be adequately covered by the Company’s applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity and, as such, these claims could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements, including DEA operating and security standards, could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The healthcare industry is highly regulated. The Company is subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the DEA, the FDA, the NRC, HHS, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the European Union member states and other comparable agencies. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the DEA, the FDA, the NRC, HHS and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of the Company’s businesses. See Note 12 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of actions taken by the DEA suspending the licenses to distribute controlled substances held by three of the Company’s distribution centers and actions the Company has taken regarding its controls against diversion of controlled substances. Any noncompliance by the Company with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The manufacture, distribution and marketing of certain of the Company’s products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA. Failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of the government to grant approvals, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in the Company and its products which could adversely affect the Company’s sales. In addition, third parties may file claims against the Company in connection these issues.    18    Table of Contents The Company is also subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. Many of these laws and regulations are vague or indefinite and may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require the Company to make changes in its operations. If the Company fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or its ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. See “Item 1—Business—Regulatory Matters” above for more information regarding healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations.  The Company’s exploration of a potential separation of its new Healthcare Supply Chain Services and Clinical and Medical Products reportable segments could have an adverse effect on business operations and its assets.  On August 7, 2008, the Company publicly announced that its Board of Directors has supported a management recommendation to actively explore a potential separation of the Company’s new Healthcare Supply Chain Services and Clinical and Medical Products reportable segments. The Company has not determined whether it will elect to pursue a separation of these reportable segments and cannot predict the impact that such a separation would have on its business operations or stock price if pursued. There are various uncertainties and risks relating to exploring a separation of the reportable segments that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business operations or assets, including:        •    exploring a separation of reportable segments may divert management’s attention from regular business concerns and disrupt operations, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operating results;        •    perceived uncertainties as to the Company’s future direction may result in increased difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees;        •    perceived uncertainties as to the Company’s future direction may have a negative impact on relationships with its customers, suppliers, vendors and partners and may result in the loss of business opportunities; and        •    the process of exploring a separation of reportable segments may be time consuming and expensive and may result in the loss of business opportunities.  To the extent that in the future, the Company determines to pursue a separation of its Healthcare Supply Chain Services and Clinical and Medical Products reportable segments, there are various uncertainties and risks relating to pursuing such a separation that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business operations or assets including those noted above as well as the possibility that such a separation may not be completed or, if completed, that the benefits of any such separation may not be achieved fully or at all.  Circumstances associated with the Company’s acquisition and divestiture strategy could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  Historically, an important element of the Company’s growth strategy has been the pursuit of acquisitions of other businesses that expand or complement the Company’s existing businesses. Acquisitions involve risks, including the risk that the Company overpays for a business or is unable to obtain in a timely manner, or at all, the synergies and other expected benefits from acquiring a business. Integrating acquired businesses also involves a number of special risks, including the following:        •    the possibility that management’s attention may be diverted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations;        •    unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems and realizing potential revenue synergies and cost savings;    19    Table of Contents     •    problems assimilating and retaining the management or employees of the acquired company or the Company’s employees following an acquisition;        •    accounting issues that could arise in connection with, or as a result of, the acquisition of the acquired company, including issues related to internal control over financial reporting;        •    regulatory or compliance issues that could exist for an acquired company or business;        •    challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses; and        •    potential adverse short-term effects on results of operations through increased costs or otherwise.  If the Company is unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  With respect to divestitures, the Company continues to evaluate the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and may decide to sell a business or product line based on such an evaluation. Any divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including the following:        •    difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel;        •    the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;        •    the assumption of certain current or future liabilities in order to induce a buyer to complete the divestiture;        •    the disruption of the Company’s business; and        •    the potential loss of key employees.  The Company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting a business or product line.  The Company may be unable to effectively introduce and market new products or may fail to keep pace with advances in technology.  The healthcare industry is characterized by continuous technological change, resulting in changing customer preferences and requirements. The success of the Company’s manufacturing businesses depends on their ability to introduce new products and adapt to these changing technologies and customer demands. The success of new product development depends on many factors, including the Company’s ability to anticipate and satisfy customer needs, obtain regulatory and reimbursement approvals on a timely basis, develop and manufacture products in a cost-effective and timely manner, maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual property and differentiate the Company’s products from those of its competitors. To compete successfully in the marketplace, the Company must make substantial investments in new product development whether internally or externally through licensing or acquisitions. The Company’s failure to introduce new and innovative products in a timely manner would have an adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.  Even if the Company is able to develop, manufacture and obtain regulatory and reimbursement approvals for its new products, the success of those products would depend upon market acceptance. Levels of market acceptance for the Company’s new products could be affected by several factors, including:        •    the availability of alternative products from the Company’s competitors;    20    Table of Contents     •    the price of the Company’s products relative to that of its competitors;        •    the timing of the Company’s market entry; and        •    the Company’s ability to market and distribute its products effectively.  The Company’s future results of operations are subject to the availability and fluctuations in the costs of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy.  The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products through its Clinical Technologies and Services and Medical Products and Technologies segments. It is possible that any of the Company’s supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters or other events or could be terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.  The Company’s manufacturing businesses use resins and other petroleum-based materials as raw materials in many of their products. Prices of oil and gas also affect the Company’s distribution and transportation costs. Oil and gas prices are volatile and have increased in recent years, resulting in higher costs to the Company to produce and distribute its products. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost-containment efforts of the Company’s customers and third party payors, the Company may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If these higher costs continue and the Company is unable fully to offset these increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or fuel surcharges, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and the products that the Company manufactures or distributes may be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.  The Company relies on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of its products, services and intangible assets, particularly within its Clinical Technologies and Services and Medical Products and Technologies segments. These proprietary rights are important to the Company’s ongoing operations. There can be no assurance that these protections will provide meaningful protection against competitive products or services or otherwise be commercially valuable or that the Company will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing its intellectual property rights against unauthorized users. There can be no assurance that the Company’s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Company’s technology.  From time to time, third parties have asserted infringement claims against the Company and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company in the future. While the Company believes that the products that it currently manufactures using its proprietary technology do not infringe upon proprietary rights of other parties or that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary, there can be no assurance that the Company would not be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others.  Additionally, the Company may be subject to litigation over infringement claims regarding the products it manufactures or distributes or it may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect its trade secrets, to enforce its patents, copyright and trademark rights to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others or to enforce indemnity rights against third parties, including manufacturers. This type of litigation can be costly and time consuming and could generate significant expenses, damage payments or restrictions or prohibitions on     21    Table of Contents  the Company’s use of its technology, which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. In addition, if the Company is found to be infringing on proprietary rights of others, the Company may be required to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or cease making, using and/or selling the infringing products.  Generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. During the pendency of these legal challenges, a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution to its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent. To the extent the Company distributes such generic products that are launched by the generic manufacturer “at risk,” the brand-name company could assert infringement claims against the Company. While the Company obtains indemnity rights from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these indemnity rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect the Company.  Risks generally associated with the Company’s information systems and implementation of a new accounting software system could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.  The Company relies on information systems in its business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to:        •    facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;        •    receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;        •    manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;        •    process payments to suppliers; and        •    facilitate the manufacturing and assembly of medical products.  The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time, including due to the actions of third parties.  In addition, during fiscal 2008, the Company began implementing a new accounting software system and will continue to transition selected financial processes to the new system throughout fiscal 2009. If the Company does not effectively implement this system or if the system does not operate as intended, it could adversely affect the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to the Company’s tax positions could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company is a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and international jurisdictions. As such, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect the Company’s tax positions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as international, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that the Company’s tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would be successful in any such challenge. See Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of Notices of Proposed Adjustment received during fiscal 2008.    22    Table of Contents The Company’s global operations are subject to a number of economic, political and regulatory risks.  The Company conducts its operations in various regions of the world outside of the United States, including North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Global economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as the Company’s in many ways. Operations are subject to the effects of global competition. Particular local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws. The Company’s global operations are affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession and currency volatility. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with the Company’s supply chain and customers and all of its activities in a particular location. While some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some of these other risks may be insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful.
