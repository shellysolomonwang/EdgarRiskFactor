Item 1A: Risk Factors   The risks described below could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. These risks are not the only risks that the Company faces. The Company’s business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to it or that the Company currently considers not to be material to its operations.  Competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company operates in markets that are highly competitive. Its pharmaceutical supply chain business competes with two national, full-line wholesale distributors, McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and a number of regional wholesale distributors, self-warehousing retail pharmacy chains, direct selling manufacturers, specialty distributors, generic pharmaceutical telemarketing distributors and third-party logistics companies, among others. The Company’s medical products distribution business encounters competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of their businesses. As a result, the Company’s businesses face continued pricing pressure from their customers. In some cases, the Company is able to offset revenue reductions caused by these pricing pressures by lowering its costs through effective product sourcing and cost controls. If the Company is unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, in recent years, the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. If this consolidation trend continues among the Company’s customers and vendors, it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may adversely impact the Company’s gross margin.    15    Table of Contents Substantial defaults or a material reduction in purchases of the Company’s products by large customers could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  In recent years, a significant portion of the Company’s revenue growth has been derived from a limited number of large customers. The Company’s largest customers, CVS and Walgreens, accounted for approximately 21% and 23%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue for fiscal 2009. The aggregate of the Company’s five largest customers, including CVS and Walgreens, accounted for approximately 54% of the Company’s revenue for fiscal 2009. In addition, CVS and Walgreens accounted for 19% and 33%, respectively, of the Company’s gross trade receivable balance at June 30, 2009. As a result, the Company’s sales and credit concentration is significant. Any defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases from these or other large customers could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, certain of the Company’s businesses have entered into agreements with GPOs. Approximately 16% of the Company’s revenue for fiscal 2009 was derived from GPO members through the contractual arrangements established with Novation and Premier. Generally, compliance by GPO members with GPO vendor selections is voluntary. Still, the loss of an agreement with a GPO could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition because the Company could lose customers or may need to reduce prices as a result.  The Company may face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform.  Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes. The Company anticipates that the current administration, Congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access. Public debate of these issues will likely continue in the future. The uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation may have an adverse effect on the Company’s customers’ purchasing decisions regarding its products and services. At this time, the Company cannot predict which, if any, healthcare reform proposals will be adopted, when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on the Company.  Changes in the U.S. healthcare environment could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company’s products and services are primarily intended to function within the current structure of the healthcare industry in the United States. In recent years, the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs. These changes include increased use of managed care, cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply distributors and medical product manufacturers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, the consolidation of healthcare providers and pharmacy chains, and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups.  The Company expects the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these changes, such as adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services, legislation or regulatory requirements relating to matters including privacy of patient information, or changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of the Company’s products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for such products and services. Changes in the healthcare industry’s or in any of the Company’s suppliers’ pricing, reimbursement, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices, or regulatory and quality requirements, or changes in the Company’s customer mix, could also significantly reduce the Company’s revenue, increase the Company’s costs or otherwise significantly affect its results of operations.  Generic pharmaceuticals. The use of generic pharmaceuticals has increased over the past several years, and healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the use of generic pharmaceuticals will continue to increase over     16    Table of Contents  the next few years as a result of efforts to lower the overall cost of healthcare and the expiration of certain pharmaceutical patents. A decrease in the availability or changes in pricing of or reimbursements for generic pharmaceuticals could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.   Prescription drug pedigree tracking. Various government agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and comparable government agencies, have increased efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply chain in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, diverted, adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the supply chain. To date, 28 states have adopted some form of pedigree tracking requirements, 15 of which currently require prescription drug pedigrees in certain situations. These laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the Company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business, and could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. See “Item 1—Business—Regulatory Matters” above for more information regarding prescription drug pedigree tracking.  Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The DRA changed the federal upper payment limit for Medicaid reimbursement from 150% of the published price for generic pharmaceuticals to 250% of the AMP and requires manufacturers to publicly report AMP for branded and generic pharmaceuticals. Recently enacted legislation has delayed the implementation of these changes until October 1, 2009. The Company expects the use of an AMP benchmark to result in a reduction in the Medicaid reimbursement rates to its customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals, which may indirectly impact the prices that the Company can charge its customers for generic pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in the Company’s gross margin. There can be no assurance that the changes in the reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the DRA will not have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. See “Item 1—Business—Regulatory Matters” above for more information regarding the DRA.  The Company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business is subject to appreciation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices which subjects the Company to risks and uncertainties.  The Company continues to generate a portion of its gross margin from the sale of some manufacturers’ products from pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution service agreement fees. For these manufacturers, a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases, as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to the Company, could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the pharmaceutical supply chain business distributes generic pharmaceuticals, which are generally subject to price deflation. An increase in the rate and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical price deflation could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to the Company’s tax positions could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company is a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and international jurisdictions. As such, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect the Company’s tax positions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as international, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that the Company’s tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would be successful in any such challenge. See Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of Notices of Proposed Adjustment.    17    Table of Contents Risks generally associated with the Company’s information systems could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.  The Company relies on information systems in its business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to:        •    facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;        •    receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;        •    manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;        •    process payments to suppliers; and        •    facilitate the manufacturing and assembly of medical products.  The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time, including due to the actions of third parties.  Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements, including DEA operating and security standards, could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The healthcare industry is highly regulated. The Company is subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of multiple federal, state and local agencies, the DEA, the FDA, the NRC, HHS, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and other comparable agencies. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of these agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.  There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of the Company’s businesses. For example, in 2007, the DEA suspended the licenses to distribute controlled substances held by three of the Company’s distribution centers until the Company reached a settlement to reinstate the licenses. Any noncompliance by the Company with applicable laws and regulations or failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The manufacture, distribution and marketing of certain of the Company’s products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA. Failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal by the government to grant approvals, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals. See Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of a Consent Decree for Condemnation and Permanent Injunction between the Company and the FDA to resolve seizure litigation over Alaris®  SE pumps. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in the Company and its products which could adversely affect the Company’s sales. In addition, third parties may file claims against the Company relating to these issues.  The Company is also subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. Many of these laws and regulations are vague or indefinite and may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require the Company to make changes in its operations. If the Company fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or its ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. See “Item 1—Business—Regulatory Matters” above for more information regarding healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations.    18    Table of Contents Disruptions in the financial market may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to the Company.  The Company’s ability to make scheduled payments or refinance its obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on its operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond its control. The credit and capital markets are experiencing significant volatility that is difficult to predict. Disruptions in the financial markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of a number of financial institutions, reduced lending activity, decreased liquidity and higher costs in the commercial paper market and reduced markets for securitizations, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit that the Company has already arranged, and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future. There can be no assurances that government initiatives in response to the disruptions in the financial markets will stabilize the markets in general or increase liquidity and the availability of credit to the Company.  Declining economic conditions could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  Disruptions in the financial markets and other macro-economic challenges currently affecting the economy and the economic outlook of the United States and other parts of the world could adversely impact the Company’s customers and vendors in a number of ways, which could adversely affect the Company. Recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending have caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase the Company’s products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change terms of sales. For example, certain hospitals delayed capital equipment purchase decisions during the second half of fiscal 2009, which affected the financial results of the Clinical and Medical Products segment during the period. The Company expects this delay will have an adverse impact on the financial results of CareFusion through the middle of calendar year 2010. If customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to the Company. Likewise, for similar reasons vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms. Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay the Company for its products or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company is involved in legal proceedings that could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings, certain of which are discussed in Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” Litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur. It is possible that cash flows or results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies.  Generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. During the pendency of these legal challenges, a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent. To the extent the Company distributes such generic products that are launched by the generic manufacturer “at risk,” the brand-name company could assert infringement claims against the Company. While the Company obtains indemnity rights from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these indemnity rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect the Company.  In addition, certain of the Company’s products and services expose it to product and professional liability risks. The availability of product liability insurance for large companies in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry is generally more limited than insurance available to smaller companies and companies in other industries. Insurance carriers providing product liability insurance to large pharmaceutical and medical device     19    Table of Contents  companies generally limit the amount of available policy limits, require larger self-insured retentions and include exclusions for certain products. Large self-insured retentions may also apply to certain professional liability risks. There can be no assurance that a successful product or professional liability claim would be adequately covered by the Company’s applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity and, as such, these claims could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  Circumstances associated with the Company’s acquisition and divestiture strategy could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  Historically, an important element of the Company’s growth strategy has been the pursuit of acquisitions of other businesses that expand or complement the Company’s existing businesses. Acquisitions involve risks, including the risk that the Company overpays for a business or is unable to realize in a timely manner, or at all, the synergies and other expected benefits from acquiring a business. Integrating acquired businesses also involves a number of special risks, including the following:        •    the possibility that management’s attention may be diverted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations;        •    unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems and realizing potential revenue synergies and cost savings;        •    problems assimilating and retaining the management or employees of the acquired company or the Company’s employees following an acquisition;        •    accounting issues that could arise in connection with, or as a result of, the acquisition of the acquired company, including issues related to internal control over financial reporting;        •    regulatory or compliance issues that could exist for an acquired company or business;        •    challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses; and        •    potential adverse effects on results of operations through increased costs or otherwise.  If the Company is unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  With respect to divestitures, the Company continues to evaluate the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and may decide to sell a business or product line based on such an evaluation. Any divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including the following:        •    difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel;        •    the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;        •    the need to agree to retain or assume certain current or future liabilities in order to complete the divestiture;        •    the disruption of the Company’s business; and        •    the potential loss of key employees.  The Company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting a business or product line.    20    Table of Contents The Company’s future results of operations are subject to the availability and fluctuations in the costs of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy.  The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials and energy (including radioisotopes, oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for its operations. It is possible that any of the Company’s supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters or other events or could be terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.  The Company’s manufacturing businesses use petroleum-based materials as raw materials in many of their products. Prices of oil and gas also affect the Company’s distribution and transportation costs. Oil and gas prices are volatile and have increased in recent years, resulting in higher costs to the Company to produce and distribute its products. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost-containment efforts of the Company’s customers and third party payors, the Company may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If costs increase in the future and the Company is unable fully to offset these increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or fuel surcharges, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  The Company’s global operations are subject to a number of economic, political and regulatory risks.  The Company conducts its operations in various regions of the world outside of the United States, including countries in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Global economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as the Company’s in many ways. The Company’s global operations are affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession, currency volatility, and global competition. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with the Company’s supply chain and customers and all of its activities in a particular location. While some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some of these other risks may be insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful.  Additionally, the Company’s global operations are also subject to risks arising from violations of U.S. laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, and various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations, including those which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries and/or with certain individuals identified by the U.S. government. If the Company fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could suffer civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  Risks associated with the Spin-Off of CareFusion.  The Company’s planned Spin-Off of CareFusion is subject to a number of risks, including the following:        •    Risk of Non-Consummation. The Company expects the distribution of 80.1% or more of CareFusion shares of common stock to occur after the close of trading on August 31, 2009. However, the Spin-Off remains subject to conditions, including: (i) the private letter ruling that the Company received from the IRS not being revoked or modified in any material respect; (ii) the receipt of opinions from counsel to the Company to the effect that the contribution and distribution will qualify as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code; (iii) no rating agency action that is likely to result in either the Company or CareFusion being downgraded below investment grade; and (iv) the making of a cash distribution from CareFusion to the Company prior to the distribution. There can be no assurance that any or all of these conditions will be met and that the Spin-Off will be completed in the manner and timeframe currently contemplated, or at all.    21    Table of Contents     •    Risks of Not Obtaining Benefits from the Spin-Off. The Company and CareFusion may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Spin-Off, or may not achieve them in a timely fashion.        •    Risks Relating to Less Diversification. If the Spin-Off is completed, the Company’s operational and financial profile will change as a result of the separation of CareFusion from the Company’s other businesses. As a result, the Company’s diversification of revenue sources will diminish, and it is possible that the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility. The Spin-Off could also be a factor causing or contributing to a determination by one or more of the rating agencies to lower the credit rating of the Company. Although the Spin-Off will not trigger an acceleration of any of the Company’s indebtedness, a ratings downgrade by any of the ratings agencies may eliminate or significantly diminish the Company’s ability to gain access to the commercial paper market, resulting in the need for the Company to use alternative sources of credit at rates that may be higher than would otherwise be available to the Company.        •    Risks Relating to Taxes. In connection with the Spin-Off, the Company received a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, among other things, the contribution by the Company of the assets of the clinical and medical products businesses to CareFusion and the distribution will qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In addition, it is a condition to the distribution that the Company receive opinions of tax counsel to the effect that the Spin-Off will qualify as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The ruling relies on, and the opinions will rely on, certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from the Company and CareFusion regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, the Company and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the Spin-Off is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of the Company or CareFusion after the Spin-Off. If the Spin-Off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.  The Company’s minority investment in CareFusion is subject to certain risks and uncertainties and the Company may not be able to capture the full benefits from this investment.  After the Spin-Off, the Company expects to retain no more than 19.9% of the outstanding shares of CareFusion common stock. As with any investment in a publicly traded company, the Company’s investment in CareFusion will be subject to certain risks and uncertainties relating to CareFusion’s business and ownership of CareFusion common stock, which risks are disclosed in detail in CareFusion’s filings with the SEC. In addition, in connection with the Spin-Off, the Company agreed to vote all of the shares of CareFusion common stock that it retains in proportion to the votes cast by CareFusion’s other stockholders, and in connection with that agreement, the Company granted CareFusion a proxy to vote the shares of CareFusion common stock held by the Company accordingly. As a result, after the Spin-Off, the Company may be required to vote its shares of CareFusion common stock in a manner that is contrary to the manner in which the Company would otherwise have voted such shares. In addition, even though the Company will be CareFusion’s largest shareholder immediately after the Spin-Off, the Company will not have any representation on CareFusion’s Board of Directors.  Pursuant to the private letter ruling received from the IRS in connection with the Spin-Off, the Company will be required to dispose of its retained shares of CareFusion common stock as soon as practicable after the     22    Table of Contents  Spin-Off and consistent with the Company’s reasons for retaining such shares, but in no event later than five years after the Spin-Off. As a result, the Company may be required to sell some or all of its retained shares of CareFusion common stock at a time when it might not otherwise choose to do so. Furthermore, any such disposition by the Company of its shares of CareFusion common stock in the public market, or the perception that such dispositions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for CareFusion common stock and adversely affect the value or the terms and conditions of such disposition. The Company currently intends to dispose of its shares of CareFusion common stock in an orderly fashion, but it is not obligated to do so.      Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments
