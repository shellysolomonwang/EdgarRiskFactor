Item 1A: Risk Factors  The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. These are not the only risks we face. Our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations.  We could suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures.  As described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in Item 1 above, we operate in markets that are highly competitive. Because of competition, our businesses face continued pricing pressure from our customers and suppliers. If we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as enhanced cost control measures, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  In addition, in recent years, the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. If this consolidation trend continues among our customers and suppliers, it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may adversely impact our results of operations.  We have a few large customers that generate a significant amount of our revenue.  As described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in Item 1 above, our sales and credit concentration is significant. For example, Walgreens and CVS accounted for approximately 24% and 22%, respectively, of our revenue for fiscal 2010. The aggregate of our five largest customers, including Walgreens and CVS, accounted for approximately 57% of our revenue for fiscal 2010. In addition, Walgreens and CVS accounted for 32% and 21%, respectively, of our gross trade receivable balance at June 30, 2010. If one or more of our large customers default in payment, terminate or do not renew contracts, or significantly reduce their purchases of our products, our results of operations and financial condition could suffer.  In addition, approximately 15% of our revenue for fiscal 2010 was derived through the contractual arrangements established with two GPOs, Novation and Premier. GPO members generally are not required to comply with GPO vendor selections. Still, the loss of an agreement with a GPO could cause us to lose customers, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our Pharmaceutical segment’s margin may be affected by prices established by manufacturers or market forces that are beyond our control.  As described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in Item 1, we generate a portion of our branded manufacturer margin from pharmaceutical price appreciation. If branded manufacturers increase prices less frequently or by smaller amounts, or restrict the amount of inventory available to us, we will earn less branded manufacturer margin.    10    Table of Contents In addition, prices for generic pharmaceuticals distributed by our pharmaceutical distribution business tend to decline over time, which could have an adverse effect on our generic manufacturer margin.  The U.S. healthcare environment is changing in many ways, some of which may not be favorable to us, as a result of recent federal healthcare legislation.  Our products and services are primarily intended to function within the current structure of the healthcare industry in the United States. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to control costs. The use of managed care has increased; Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels have declined; distributors, manufacturers, healthcare providers and pharmacy chains have consolidated; and large, sophisticated purchasing groups have become more prevalent.  In March 2010, Congress approved, and the President signed into law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively the “Healthcare Reform Acts”). Among other things, the Healthcare Reform Acts seek to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million uninsured Americans. Many of the significant changes in the Healthcare Reform Acts do not take effect until 2014, including a requirement that most Americans carry health insurance. We expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services, but other provisions of the Healthcare Reform Acts could affect us adversely. The Healthcare Reform Acts contain many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid. Beginning in 2013, each medical device manufacturer will have to pay a tax in an amount equal to 2.3% of the price for which the manufacturer sells its medical devices. We manufacture and sell devices that will be subject to this tax. Additionally, the Healthcare Reform Acts changed the federal upper payment limit for Medicaid reimbursement to no less than 175% of the average weighted manufacturer’s price (“AMP”) from 250% of the lowest average manufacturer’s price for generic pharmaceuticals. The AMP provision is expected to become effective in October 2010. We could be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, or healthcare services.  Our business requires consistent, diligent and rigorous compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements.  The healthcare industry is highly regulated. As described above in greater detail in the discussion of our business in Item 1, we are subject to regulation in the United States at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries. Many of our subsidiaries are required to register for permits or licenses with, and to comply with operating and security standards of, regulatory agencies. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, or if allegations are made that we fail to comply, our results of operations and financial condition could suffer.        •    To lawfully operate our businesses, we are required to hold permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals from governmental bodies. Failure to maintain or renew, or obtain without significant delay, necessary permits, licenses or approvals could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, in fiscal 2008, the DEA suspended licenses to distribute controlled substances held by three of our distribution centers for almost a year because of alleged defects in our controlled substance anti-diversion controls.        •    Products that we manufacture, distribute or market are required to comply with regulatory requirements. Noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance could result in product corrective actions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, governmental refusal to grant approvals, restrictions on operations, withdrawal of existing approvals and third party claims.        •    We are required to comply with laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. The scope and applicability of these laws is not always clear. If we fail to comply with them, we could be subject    11    Table of Contents       to federal or state government investigations and resulting civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. The scope or requirements of these laws or regulations may be interpreted or applied by a regulator, prosecutor or judge in a manner that could negatively impact or require us to change our operations.  We could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions.   We are a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and many foreign countries. As a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of many jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative initiatives are proposed, including proposals to repeal LIFO (last-in, first-out) treatment of inventory, that could adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate or tax payments. Tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others. We may not be able to defend these challenges successfully, which may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments.  Our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems and critical facilities.  We rely on information systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to:        •    facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;        •    receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;        •    manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;        •    process payments to suppliers;        •    facilitate the manufacturing and assembly of medical products; and        •    generate financial transactions and information.  Our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities, including our national logistics center. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems or facilities are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events or actions of third parties, or fail for any extended period of time.  The Medical segment is working on a medical business transformation project, which includes a new information system for supply chain and manufacturing related processes. The Medical segment is planning to transition selected processes to the new system throughout fiscal 2012 and 2013. If the system is not effectively implemented or fails to operate as intended, it could adversely affect the Medical segment’s supply chain and manufacturing operations and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.  Because of the nature of our business, we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations.  Due to the nature of our businesses, which includes the manufacture and distribution of healthcare products, we may from time to time become involved in legal proceedings. For instance, some of the products we manufacture or distribute may be alleged to cause personal injury or violate the intellectual property rights of another party, subjecting us to product liability or infringement claims. While we generally obtain indemnity rights from the manufacturers of products we distribute, and we carry product liability insurance, it is possible that liability from such claims could exceed those protections. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could harm our cash flows or results of operations.    12    Table of Contents Acquisitions are not always as successful as we expect them to be.  Historically, an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses. Acquisitions involve risks: we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition; we may encounter unforeseen accounting or internal control over financial reporting issues; or the acquired business may have regulatory or compliance issues that we did not anticipate.  We depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products.  We depend on various components, compounds, raw materials and energy (including radioisotopes and oil, oil-related and other commodities) supplied by others for our operations. Any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters or other events or could be terminated. A sustained interruption in the flow of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, while we have processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations.  Our manufacturing businesses use oil, oil-related and other commodities as raw materials in many products. Prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs. Oil and gas prices are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years, so our costs to produce and distribute our products also have fluctuated. Because the healthcare industry is highly competitive and many customers and third-party payors have instituted cost-containment initiatives, we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions, or recover these costs through price increases or fuel surcharges, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  Our global operations are subject to a number of economic, political and regulatory risks.  Our global operations are affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession, currency volatility and competition. Political changes can disrupt our supply chain—as well as our customers and operating activities—in a particular location. We may not be able to enter into hedges or obtain insurance to protect us against these risks, and any hedges that we enter into or insurance that we are able to obtain may be expensive and may not successfully mitigate these risks.  In addition, our global operations are subject to risks arising from violations of U.S. laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, and various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations, including those that may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within certain countries or with certain counterparties. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties.  Risks associated with the Spin-Off of CareFusion.  This section describes some of the risks that exist as a result of the Spin-Off of CareFusion, which is described in greater detail in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.  CareFusion may not satisfy all of its contractual obligations. We entered into a number of agreements with CareFusion that govern the rights and obligations of the parties following the Spin-Off. We have certain rights under those agreements, including indemnification against certain liabilities allocated to CareFusion. The failure of CareFusion to perform its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.    13    Table of Contents The transaction may have unexpected tax consequences. In connection with the Spin-Off, we received a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that the contribution by us of the assets of the clinical and medical products businesses to CareFusion and the distribution of CareFusion shares to our shareholders would qualify as a tax-free transaction under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). In addition, we received opinions of tax counsel to the effect that the Spin-Off would qualify as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The IRS private letter ruling and the opinions of counsel rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and CareFusion regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the IRS ruling or the opinions of tax counsel. Similarly, the IRS could determine on audit that the Spin-Off is taxable if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions of counsel that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in stock ownership of either Cardinal Health or CareFusion. If the Spin-Off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant tax liabilities.  We may not be able to capture the full benefits from our minority investment in CareFusion. As of June 30, 2010, we owned approximately 30.5 million CareFusion shares. As with any investment in a publicly traded company, this investment is subject to risks and uncertainties relating to CareFusion’s business, as disclosed in CareFusion’s filings with the SEC. In addition, we entered into an agreement in connection with the Spin-Off under which we committed to vote all of our CareFusion shares in proportion to the votes cast by CareFusion’s other shareholders and we do not have any representation on CareFusion’s Board of Directors. As a result, we are not able to exert control or influence over CareFusion to act in a manner that we may believe best for protecting or enhancing the value of our investment.  Under the private letter ruling from the IRS relating to the Spin-Off, we must dispose of the CareFusion shares as soon as practicable after the Spin-Off and consistent with our reasons for retaining the shares, but no later than August 31, 2014. As a result, we may be required to sell some or all of the shares at a time when we might not otherwise choose to do so. Additionally, any disposition of CareFusion shares by us in the public market, or the perception that such dispositions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for CareFusion shares and adversely affect the value or the terms and conditions of such disposition.
