Item 1A: Risk Factors  The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. These are not the only risks we face. Our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations.  We could suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures.  As described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in Item 1 above, we operate in markets that are highly competitive. Because of competition, our businesses face continued pricing pressure from our customers and suppliers. If we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as enhanced cost control measures, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  In addition, in recent years, the healthcare industry has continued to consolidate. Further consolidation among our customers and suppliers (including branded pharmaceutical manufacturers) could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may adversely impact our results of operations.    9    Table of Contents We have a few large customers that generate a significant amount of our revenue.  As described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in Item 1 above, our sales and credit concentration is significant. For example, Walgreens and CVS accounted for approximately 23 percent and 22 percent, respectively, of our revenue for fiscal 2011. The aggregate of our five largest customers, including Walgreens and CVS, accounted for approximately 59 percent of our revenue for fiscal 2011. In addition, Walgreens and CVS accounted for 31 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of our gross trade receivable balance at June 30, 2011. If one or more of our large customers default in payment, terminate or do not renew contracts, or significantly reduce their purchases of our products, our results of operations and financial condition could suffer.  The United States healthcare environment is changing in many ways, some of which may not be favorable to us, including changes resulting from federal healthcare legislation.  The healthcare industry continues to undergo significant changes designed to increase access to medical care, improve safety and contain costs. Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels have declined; the use of managed care has increased; distributors, manufacturers, healthcare providers and pharmacy chains have consolidated; and large purchasing groups are more prevalent.  In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively the “Healthcare Reform Acts”) were enacted. Among other things, the Healthcare Reform Acts seek to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million uninsured Americans. Many of the significant changes in the Healthcare Reform Acts do not take effect until 2014, including a requirement that most Americans carry health insurance. We expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services, but other provisions of the Healthcare Reform Acts could affect us adversely. The Healthcare Reform Acts contain many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid. Beginning in 2013, each medical device manufacturer will have to pay a tax in an amount equal to 2.3 percent of the price for which the manufacturer sells its medical devices. We manufacture and sell devices that will be subject to this tax. Additionally, the Healthcare Reform Acts changed the federal upper payment limit for Medicaid reimbursement to no less than 175 percent of the average weighted manufacturer’s price from 250 percent of the lowest average manufacturer’s price for generic pharmaceuticals. We could be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, medical devices or healthcare services.  Our business requires consistent, diligent and rigorous compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements.  The healthcare industry is highly regulated. As described above in greater detail in the discussion of our business in Item 1, we are subject to regulation in the United States at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries. In addition, the United States federal government and state governments are devoting greater resources to the enforcement of these laws. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, or if allegations are made that we fail to comply, our results of operations and financial condition could suffer.        •    To lawfully operate our businesses, we are required to hold permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals from, and to comply with operating and security standards of, governmental bodies. Failure to maintain or renew, or obtain without significant delay, necessary permits, licenses or approvals, or to comply with required standards, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.        •    Products that we manufacture, source, distribute or market are required to comply with regulatory requirements. Noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance could result in product corrective actions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, civil or criminal sanctions, governmental refusal to grant approvals, restrictions on    10    Table of Contents       operations, withdrawal of existing approvals and third-party claims, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.        •    We are required to comply with laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. If we fail to comply with them, we could be subject to federal or state government investigations, or false claims act proceedings initiated by private parties, which could result in civil judgments and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. The scope or requirements of these laws or regulations may be interpreted or applied by a regulator, prosecutor or judge in a manner that could negatively impact or require us to change our operations.        •    Our global operations are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with United States and foreign export control, trade embargo and customs laws. If we fail to comply with them, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties.  We could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions.  We are a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and many foreign countries. As a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of many jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative initiatives are proposed, such as the repeal of LIFO (last-in, first-out) treatment of inventory or the current U.S. taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries, that could adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate, tax payments or financial condition. Tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others. These challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments or financial condition.  Our Pharmaceutical segment’s margin may be affected by prices established by manufacturers or market forces that are beyond our control.  As described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in Item 1, we generate a portion of our branded manufacturer margin from pharmaceutical price appreciation. If branded manufacturers increase prices less frequently or by smaller amounts, we will earn less branded manufacturer margin. In addition, prices for generic pharmaceuticals distributed by our pharmaceutical distribution business have generally declined over time, which could have an adverse effect on our generic manufacturer margin, if not offset by generic pharmaceutical programs, including new product launches.  Our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems and critical facilities.  We rely on information systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to:        •    facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;        •    receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;        •    manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;        •    process payments to suppliers;        •    facilitate the manufacturing and assembly of medical products; and        •    generate financial transactions and information.  Our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities, including our national logistics center. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems or facilities are interrupted,    11    Table of Contents  damaged by unforeseen events or actions of third parties, or fail for any extended period of time. Any data security breach could adversely impact our operations, results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal requirements.  The Medical segment is working on a medical business transformation project, which includes a new information system for certain supply chain processes. The Medical segment is planning to transition selected processes to the new system throughout fiscal 2012 and 2013. If the system is not effectively implemented or fails to operate as intended, it could adversely affect the Medical segment’s supply chain operations and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.  Because of the nature of our business, we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations.  Due to the nature of our businesses, which includes the manufacture and distribution of healthcare products, we may from time to time become involved in legal proceedings. For instance, some of the products we manufacture or distribute may be alleged to cause personal injury or violate the intellectual property rights of another party, subjecting us to product liability or infringement claims. While we generally obtain indemnity rights from the manufacturers of products we distribute and we carry product liability insurance, it is possible that liability from such claims could exceed those protections. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could harm our cash flows or results of operations.  Acquisitions are not always as successful as we expect them to be.  An important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses. As described above, in fiscal 2011, we acquired Kinray, P4 Healthcare and Yong Yu. Acquisitions involve risks: we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition; we may encounter unforeseen accounting or internal control over financial reporting issues; or the acquired business may have regulatory or compliance issues that we did not anticipate.  We depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products.  We depend on the availability of various components, compounds, raw materials and energy (including radioisotopes and oil-based resins, cotton, latex, diesel fuel and other commodities) supplied by others for our operations. Any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, or could be terminated. A sustained interruption in the flow of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, while we have processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations.  Our manufacturing businesses use oil-based resins, cotton, latex, and other commodities as raw materials in many products. Prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs. Prices of these commodities are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years, so our costs to produce and distribute our products also have fluctuated. Due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations, we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions, or recover these costs through price increases or fuel surcharges, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  Our global operations are subject to economic, political and currency risks.  Our global operations are affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession, currency volatility and competition. Political changes can disrupt our supply chain—as well as our customers and    12    Table of Contents  operating activities—in a particular location. We may not be able to enter into hedges or obtain insurance to protect us against these risks, and any hedges that we enter into or insurance that we are able to obtain may be expensive and may not successfully mitigate these risks.  Risks associated with the Spin-Off.  CareFusion may not satisfy all of its contractual obligations. We entered into a number of agreements with CareFusion that govern the rights and obligations of the parties following the Spin-Off. We have certain rights under those agreements, including indemnification against certain liabilities allocated to CareFusion. The failure of CareFusion to perform its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  The transaction may have unexpected tax consequences. In connection with the Spin-Off, we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to the effect that the contribution by us of the assets of the clinical and medical products businesses to CareFusion and the distribution of CareFusion shares to our shareholders would qualify as a tax-free transaction under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). In addition, we received opinions of tax counsel to the effect that the Spin-Off would qualify as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The IRS private letter ruling and the opinions of counsel rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and CareFusion regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the IRS ruling or the opinions of tax counsel. Similarly, the IRS could determine on audit that the Spin-Off is taxable if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions of counsel that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in stock ownership of either Cardinal Health or CareFusion. If the Spin-Off is determined to be taxable for United States federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders that are subject to United States federal income tax could incur significant tax liabilities.
