Item 1A: Risk Factors  The risks described below could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. These risks are not the only risks that the Company faces. The Company’s business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to it or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial to its operations.  Competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company operates in markets that are highly competitive. For example, the Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution business competes with two national wholesale distributors, McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and a number of smaller regional wholesale distributors, self-warehousing chains, direct selling manufacturers, specialty distributors and third-party logistics companies. Competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  Substantial defaults or a material reduction in purchases of the Company’s products by large customers could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  In recent years, a significant portion of the Company’s revenue growth has been derived from a limited number of large customers. The Company’s largest customers, CVS and Walgreens, accounted for approximately     12    Table of Contents  21% and 14%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue (by dollar volume) for fiscal 2006. The aggregate of the Company’s five largest customers, including CVS and Walgreens, accounted for approximately 46% of the Company’s revenue (by dollar volume) for fiscal 2006. In addition, CVS and Walgreens accounted for 25% and 26%, respectively, of the Company gross trade receivable balance at June 30, 2006. As a result, the Company’s sales and credit concentration is significant. Any defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases from these or other large customers could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, certain of the Company’s businesses have entered into agreements with GPOs. Approximately 15% of the Company’s revenue for fiscal 2006 was derived from GPO members through the contractual arrangements established with Novation and Premier. Generally, compliance by GPO members with GPO vendor selections is voluntary. Still, the loss of an agreement with a GPO could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition because the Company could lose customers or have to reduce prices as a result.  Changes in the United States healthcare environment could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and the Company expects the industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these changes, such as adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services, legislation or regulations governing the privacy of patient information, or the delivery or pricing of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of the Company’s products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for the Company’s products and services. Changes in the healthcare industry’s pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices, or changes in the Company’s customer mix, could also significantly reduce the Company’s revenue and results of operations.  Healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents. A decrease in the availability or changes in pricing of generic drugs could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  There have been increasing efforts by various levels of government, including state departments of health, state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. Certain states, such as Florida, have already adopted laws and regulations, including pedigree tracking requirements, that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system. Regulations adopted under the federal Prescription Drug Marketing Act, which will be effective December 1, 2006, will also require the passage of pedigree information in defined circumstances. Other states and government agencies are currently considering similar laws and regulations. These laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution business, and could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  New federal legislation was enacted on February 8, 2006 that, among other things, changes the prescription drug reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements for generic pharmaceuticals under Medicaid to reduce costs for that program. Under this new legislation, the major changes with respect to generic pharmaceuticals are expected to become effective in 2007. Various administrative agencies are in the process of defining the specific details of the legislation. The Company is continuing to work with its customers and the regulatory agencies in this process. The Company is currently developing plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative changes. If the Company fails to successfully develop and implement such plans, this change in reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of this new legislation could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company’s Medical Products and Services segment, at times, purchases medical/surgical and laboratory products from vendors other than the original manufacturer of such products. Certain manufacturers     13    Table of Contents  have adopted policies limiting the ability of the segment’s businesses to purchase products from anyone other than the manufacturer. If this practice becomes more widespread, the ability of the Medical Products and Services segment to purchase products from other distributors, as well as its ability to sell excess inventories to other distributors, may be impaired. This could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution business is subject to inflation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices, which subjects the Company to risks and uncertainties.  As part of the Pharmaceutical Distribution business’s transition to fee-for-service terms, some distribution service agreements entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflation-based compensation component to them. Arrangements with other branded manufacturers continue to be solely inflation-based. If the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price inflation slows, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, the Pharmaceutical Distribution business distributes generic pharmaceuticals, which are subject to price deflation. If the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  The ongoing SEC investigation and U.S. Attorney inquiry could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company is the subject of a formal SEC investigation and an inquiry by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. In April 2004, the Company’s Audit Committee commenced its own internal review, assisted by independent counsel. Although the Company is continuing in its efforts to respond to these inquiries and provide all information required, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the SEC investigation or the U.S. Attorney inquiry. There can be no assurance that the scope of the SEC investigation or the U.S. Attorney inquiry will not expand or that other regulatory agencies will not become involved.  The outcome of, and costs associated with, the SEC investigation and the U.S. Attorney inquiry could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The outcome of the SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include the institution of administrative, civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving the Company and/or current or former Company employees, officers and/or directors, as well as the imposition of fines and other penalties, remedies and sanctions.  The Company continues to engage in settlement discussions with the staff of the SEC and has reached an agreement-in-principle on the basic terms of a potential settlement involving the Company that the SEC staff has indicated it is prepared to recommend to the Commission. The proposed settlement is subject to the completion of definitive documentation as well as acceptance and authorization by the Commission and would, among other things, require the Company to pay a $35 million penalty. The Company accordingly recorded a reserve of $10 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 in addition to the $25 million reserve recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. There can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to resolve the SEC’s investigation with respect to the Company will be successful, or that the amount reserved will be sufficient, and the Company cannot predict the timing or the final terms of any settlement.  The Company is subject to legal proceedings that could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.  The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings, which, if decided adversely to the Company or settled by the Company, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company is subject to several class action lawsuits brought against the Company and certain of its former and present officers and directors since July 2004. The Company is currently unable to predict or determine the outcome or resolution of these proceedings, or to estimate the amounts of, or potential range of, loss with respect to these proceedings. The range of possible resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments against the Company or settlements that could require substantial payments by the Company. These payments could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition,     14    Table of Contents  liquidity and cash flows. The Company discusses these cases and other litigation to which it is a party in greater detail below under the caption “Item 3—Legal Proceedings” and in Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”  In addition, the Company is subject to product and professional liability risks. The availability of product liability insurance for companies in the pharmaceutical industry is generally more limited than insurance available to companies in other industries. Insurance carriers providing product liability insurance to pharmaceutical companies generally limit the amount of available policy limits, require larger self-insured retentions and include exclusions for certain products. There can be no assurance that a successful product or professional liability claim would be adequately covered by the Company’s applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity and, as such, these claims could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  Additional restatements may be required, the historical consolidated financial statements may change or require amendment or additional disciplinary actions may be required.  During September and October 2004, the Audit Committee reached certain conclusions with respect to findings from its internal review, which were discussed in Notes 1 and 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in the 2004 Form 10-K. In connection with these conclusions, the Audit Committee determined that the consolidated financial statements of the Company with respect to fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, as well as the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, should be restated to reflect the conclusions from its internal review. In January 2005, the Audit Committee took disciplinary actions with respect to the Company’s employees who it determined bore responsibility for certain of these matters.  There can be no assurance that additional restatements will not be required, that the historical consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s previously-filed public reports or this report will not change or require amendment, or that additional disciplinary actions will not be required in such circumstances. In addition, as the SEC investigation and U.S. Attorney inquiry continue, new issues may be identified, or the Audit Committee may make additional findings if it receives additional information, that may have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the scope of the restatements described in the Company’s previously-filed public reports or this report.  Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The healthcare industry is highly regulated. The Company is subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the DEA, the FDA, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the NRC, DHHS, the European Union member states and other comparable agencies. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the DEA, the FDA, the NRC, DHHS and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.  Although the Company believes that it is in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of the Company’s operations with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of the Company’s businesses. Any noncompliance by the Company with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  On August 28, 2006, the Company announced that it has suspended production, sales, repairs and installation of its Alaris® SE infusion pump after approximately 1,300 units were seized by the FDA. On August 15, 2006, the Company initiated a voluntary field corrective action of the product as a result of information indicating that a sensitive keypad posed a risk of “key bounce” and could lead to over-infusion of patients. As part of the field corrective action, the Company sent letters and warning labels to its customers and is currently     15    Table of Contents  testing a modification that reduces sensitivity of the keyboard. This modification will need to be validated on the product and approved by the FDA. These actions did not require the return of products currently in use by customers and the Company currently has no plans of recalling these products. The Company has stopped manufacturing and distribution of the Alaris SE infusion pumps pending resolution of the issue with the FDA. There have been approximately 140,000 Alaris SE infusion pumps distributed worldwide during the past 12 years and the product line currently represents less than 1% of annual revenue for the Clinical Technologies and Services segment. The Company does not believe that implementation of the modification currently being tested will materially affect the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. However, the Company has not completed its testing or received approval from the FDA and if additional remedial actions are deemed necessary by the Company or the FDA, the effect could become material to the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.  The Company is subject to extensive local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. The federal government continues to scrutinize potentially fraudulent practices in the healthcare industry in an attempt to minimize the cost that such practices have on Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Many of these laws and regulations are complex and broadly written and could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require the Company to make changes in its operations. If the Company fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or its ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.  Circumstances associated with the Company’s acquisition strategy could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  An important element of the Company’s growth strategy historically has been the pursuit of acquisitions of other businesses which expand or complement the Company’s existing businesses. Acquisitions involve risks, including the risk that the Company overpays for a business or is unable to obtain the synergies and other expected benefits from acquiring the business. Integrating acquired businesses also involves a number of special risks, including the following:        •   the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations;        •   unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems and realizing potential operating synergies;        •   problems assimilating and retaining the employees of the acquired company or the Company’s employees following an acquisition;        •   accounting issues that could arise in connection with, or as a result of, the acquisition of the acquired company, including unforeseen issues related to internal control over financial reporting;        •   regulatory or compliance issues that could exist for an acquired company;        •   challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses; and        •   potential adverse short-term effects on results of operations through increased costs or otherwise.  If the Company is unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  The Company could be adversely affected if transitions in senior management are not successful.  The Company’s operations depend to a large extent on the efforts of its senior management. On April 17, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed R. Kerry Clark as President and Chief Executive Officer. In connection with this appointment, the Company’s former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Robert D. Walter, became Executive Chairman of the Board. In addition, several other members of senior management have joined the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2005.  The Company seeks to develop and retain an effective management team through the proper positioning of existing key employees and the addition of new management personnel where necessary. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if transitions in senior management are not successful or if the Company is unable to sustain an effective management team.    16    Table of Contents The Company’s future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy.  The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products through its Medical Products and Services, Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services and Clinical Technologies and Services segments. It is possible that any of the Company’s supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters or other events or could be terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.  Proprietary technology protections may not be adequate.  The Company relies on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of its products, services and intangible assets. These proprietary rights are important to the Company’s ongoing operations. There can be no assurance that these protections will provide meaningful protection against competitive products or services or otherwise be commercially valuable or that the Company will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing its intellectual property rights against unauthorized users. There can be no assurance that the Company’s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Company’s technology.  The products that the Company manufactures or distributes may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.  From time to time, third parties have asserted infringement claims against the Company and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company in the future. While the Company believes that the products that it currently manufactures using its proprietary technology do not infringe upon proprietary rights of other parties or that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary, there can be no assurance that the Company would not be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others.  The Company may be subject to litigation over infringement claims regarding the products it manufactures or distributes. This type of litigation can be costly and time consuming and could generate significant expenses, damage payments or restrictions or prohibitions on the Company’s use of its technology, which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. In addition, if the Company is found to be infringing on proprietary rights of others, the Company may be required to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or cease making, using and/or selling the infringing products.  Generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. During the pendency of these legal challenges, a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution to its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent. The Company may distribute that generic product purchased from the generics manufacturer. As a result, the brand-name company may assert infringement claims against the Company. While the Company generally obtains indemnity rights from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these indemnity rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect the Company.    17    Table of Contents Risks generally associated with the Company’s information systems could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.  The Company relies on information systems in its business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to:        •   facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;        •   receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;        •   manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and        •   process payments to suppliers.  The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time, including due to the actions of third parties.  Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to the Company’s tax positions could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company is a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and international jurisdictions. As such, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect the Company’s tax positions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as international, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that the Company’s tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would be successful in any such challenge.  The Company’s global operations are subject to a number of economic, political and regulatory risks.  The Company conducts its operations in various regions of the world outside of the United States, including North America, South America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Global economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as the Company’s in many ways. Operations are subject to the effects of global competition. Particular local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws. The Company’s global operations are affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession and currency volatility. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with the Company’s supply chain and customers and all of its activities in a particular location. While some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful.
