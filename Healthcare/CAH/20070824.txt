Item 1A:    Risk Factors        The risks described below could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. These risks are not the only risks that the Company faces. The Company’s business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to it or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial to its operations.     Competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.     The Company operates in markets that are highly competitive. For example, the Company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business competes with two national wholesale distributors, McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and a number of smaller regional wholesale distributors, self-warehousing chains, direct selling manufacturers, specialty distributors and third-party logistics companies. In addition, certain of the Company’s customers have consolidated and may continue to do so in the future. Competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.     Substantial defaults or a material reduction in purchases of the Company’s products by large customers could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.     In recent years, a significant portion of the Company’s revenue growth has been derived from a limited number of large customers. The Company’s largest customers, CVS and Walgreens, accounted for approximately 21% and 19%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue for fiscal 2007. The aggregate of the Company’s five largest customers, including CVS and Walgreens, accounted for approximately 50% of the Company’s revenue for fiscal 2007. In addition, CVS and Walgreens accounted for 20% and 27%, respectively, of the Company’s gross trade receivable balance at June 30, 2007. As a result, the Company’s sales and credit concentration is significant. Any    15    Table of Contents   defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases from these or other large customers could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.     In addition, certain of the Company’s businesses have entered into agreements with GPOs. Approximately 10% of the Company’s revenue for fiscal 2007 was derived from GPO members through the contractual arrangements established with Novation and Premier. Generally, compliance by GPO members with GPO vendor selections is voluntary. Still, the loss of an agreement with a GPO could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition because the Company could lose customers or have to reduce prices as a result.     Changes in the United States healthcare environment could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.     The healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and the Company expects the industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these changes, such as adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services, legislation or regulations governing the privacy of patient information, or the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of the Company’s products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for the Company’s products and services. The Company expects continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes in the healthcare industry’s or any suppliers’ pricing, reimbursement, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices, or changes in the Company’s customer mix, could also significantly reduce the Company’s revenue, increase the Company’s costs or otherwise significantly impact its results of operations.     Healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic pharmaceuticals will increase over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain pharmaceutical patents. A decrease in the availability or changes in pricing of or reimbursements for generic pharmaceuticals could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.     There have been increasing efforts by various levels of government, including state departments of health, state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. Several states have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations, including pedigree tracking requirements, that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system. Florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and California has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using electronic pedigrees. Regulations requiring pedigree and chain of custody tracking in certain circumstances adopted under the federal Prescription Drug Marketing Act became effective on December 1, 2006. These federal regulations have been challenged in a case brought by secondary distributors. A preliminary injunction was issued by the federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York that temporarily enjoined implementation of these federal regulations. These laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the Company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business, and could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.     The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (“DRA”) includes provisions that change the prescription drug reimbursement formula for generic pharmaceuticals under Medicaid to a reimbursement formula based on the lowest average manufacturers’ price in an effort to reduce costs for that program. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) released a final rule implementing these provisions on July 6, 2007. Under the final rule, the major changes with respect to generic pharmaceuticals are expected to become effective in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2008. The final rule also requires for the first time public reporting by the manufacturers of the average manufacturers’ price (as defined by CMS) for branded and generic pharmaceuticals. The Company is continuing to work with its customers and the regulatory agencies in this process. The Company is currently developing plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative changes. If the Company fails to successfully develop and implement such plans, this change in reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the DRA could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.    16    Table of Contents     The Company’s Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Medical segment, at times, purchases medical/surgical and laboratory products from vendors other than the original manufacturer of such products. Certain manufacturers have adopted policies limiting the ability of the segment’s businesses to purchase products from anyone other than the manufacturer. If this practice becomes more widespread, the ability of the Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Medical segment to purchase products from other distributors, as well as its ability to sell excess inventories to other distributors, may be impaired. This could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.     The Company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business is subject to appreciation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices, which subjects the Company to risks and uncertainties.     Some distribution service agreements entered into by the Company with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers have a price appreciation-based component to them in addition to a service fee component. The Company also continues to generate gross margin from the sale of some manufacturers’ products from pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution service agreement fees. If the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price appreciation slows, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.     In addition, the pharmaceutical supply chain business distributes generic pharmaceuticals, which are generally subject to price deflation. If the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.     The Company is subject to legal proceedings that could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.     The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings, which, if decided adversely to the Company or settled by the Company on unfavorable terms, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The Company discusses these legal proceedings in greater detail below in Note 12 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”     In addition, the Company’s products or services expose it to product and professional liability risks. The availability of product liability insurance for large companies in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry is generally more limited than insurance available to smaller companies and companies in other industries. Insurance carriers providing product liability insurance to large pharmaceutical and medical device companies generally limit the amount of available policy limits, require larger self-insured retentions and include exclusions for certain products. There can be no assurance that a successful product or professional liability claim would be adequately covered by the Company’s applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity and, as such, these claims could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.     Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.     The healthcare industry is highly regulated. The Company is subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the DEA, the FDA, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the NRC, DHHS, the European Union member states and other comparable agencies. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the DEA, the FDA, the NRC, DHHS and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.     Although the Company believes that it is in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of the Company’s operations with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of the Company’s businesses. Any noncompliance by the Company with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.    17    Table of Contents   The manufacture, distribution and marketing of certain of the Company’s products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA. Failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of the government to grant approvals, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals. See Note 12 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of the Alaris SE Pump recall. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in the Company and its products which could adversely affect the Company’s sales. In addition, third parties may file claims against the Company in connection these issues.     The Company is also subject to extensive local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. The federal government continues to scrutinize potentially fraudulent practices in the healthcare industry in an attempt to minimize the cost that such practices have on Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. In addition, state attorney general offices have investigated, and may in the future investigate, the Company’s operations for compliance with such laws and regulations. For example, certain state attorney general offices are alleging that the Company has caused Medicaid reimbursements to be paid for repackaged pharmaceuticals without paying the required Medicaid rebate and that certain of the Company’s repackaging business practices violate the Medicaid rebate statute. See Note 12 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of the state attorneys general investigation related to repackaged pharmaceuticals. Many of these laws and regulations are complex and broadly written and could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require the Company to make changes in its operations. If the Company fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could suffer civil damages and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or its ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.     Circumstances associated with the Company’s acquisition strategy could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.     An important element of the Company’s growth strategy historically has been the pursuit of acquisitions of other businesses which expand or complement the Company’s existing businesses. Acquisitions involve risks, including the risk that the Company overpays for a business or is unable to obtain the synergies and other expected benefits from acquiring a business in a timely manner, or at all. Integrating acquired businesses also involves a number of special risks, including the following:              •   the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations;         •   unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems and realizing potential revenue synergies and cost savings;         •   problems assimilating and retaining the management or employees of the acquired company or the Company’s employees following an acquisition;         •   accounting issues that could arise in connection with, or as a result of, the acquisition of the acquired company, including issues related to internal control over financial reporting;         •   regulatory or compliance issues that could exist for an acquired company or business;         •   challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses; and         •   potential adverse short-term effects on results of operations through increased costs or otherwise.       If the Company is unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.     Consolidating the headquarters of the Healthcare Supply Chain Services sector could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.     On April 30, 2007, the Company announced that it was moving the headquarters of its Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Medical segment and certain corporate functions from Waukegan, Illinois to the Company’s corporate headquarters in Dublin, Ohio. This consolidation is expected to take place over the next two years. The consolidation could result in customer service and other business disruptions in the Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Medical segment and challenges in retaining this segment’s key employees. If the Company is unable to    18    Table of Contents   successfully complete the Healthcare Supply Chain Services headquarters consolidation, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.     The Company’s future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy.     The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products through its Clinical Technologies and Services and Medical Products Manufacturing segments. It is possible that any of the Company’s supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters or other events or could be terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.     Proprietary technology protections may not be adequate.     The Company relies on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of its products, services and intangible assets. These proprietary rights are important to the Company’s ongoing operations. There can be no assurance that these protections will provide meaningful protection against competitive products or services or otherwise be commercially valuable or that the Company will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing its intellectual property rights against unauthorized users. There can be no assurance that the Company’s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Company’s technology.     The products that the Company manufactures or distributes may be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.     From time to time, third parties have asserted infringement claims against the Company and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company in the future. While the Company believes that the products that it currently manufactures using its proprietary technology do not infringe upon proprietary rights of other parties or that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary, there can be no assurance that the Company would not be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others.     The Company may be subject to litigation over infringement claims regarding the products it manufactures or distributes. This type of litigation can be costly and time consuming and could generate significant expenses, damage payments or restrictions or prohibitions on the Company’s use of its technology, which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. In addition, if the Company is found to be infringing on proprietary rights of others, the Company may be required to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or cease making, using and/or selling the infringing products.     Generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. During the pendency of these legal challenges, a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution to its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent. The Company may distribute that generic product purchased from the generics manufacturer. As a result, the brand-name company may assert infringement claims against the Company. While the Company generally obtains indemnity rights from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these indemnity rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect the Company.     Risks generally associated with the Company’s information systems and implementation of a new accounting software system could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.     The Company relies on information systems in its business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to:              •   facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;      19    Table of Contents              •   receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;         •   manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;         •   process payments to suppliers; and         •   facilitate the manufacturing and assembly of medical products.       The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time, including due to the actions of third parties.     In addition, in July 2007, the Company began implementing a new accounting software system and will transition selected financial processes to the new system throughout fiscal 2008 and 2009. If the Company does not effectively implement this system or if the system does not operate as intended, it could adversely affect the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.     Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to the Company’s tax positions could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.     The Company is a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and international jurisdictions. As such, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect the Company’s tax positions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as international, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that the Company’s tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would be successful in any such challenge.     The Company’s global operations are subject to a number of economic, political and regulatory risks.     The Company conducts its operations in various regions of the world outside of the United States, including North America, South America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Global economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as the Company’s in many ways. Operations are subject to the effects of global competition. Particular local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws. The Company’s global operations are affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession and currency volatility. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with the Company’s supply chain and customers and all of its activities in a particular location. While some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some of these other risks may be insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful             Item 1B:    Unresolved Staff Comments
