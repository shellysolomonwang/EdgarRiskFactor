ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.  Abbott may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, technology licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances to expand its product offerings and geographic presence as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition, license arrangement, or strategic alliance. Other companies may compete with Abbott for these strategic opportunities. Further, even if Abbott is successful in making the acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects, individually or in combination, could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. Abbott could experience difficulties in integrating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities, and personnel with diverse backgrounds. Integration of an acquired business also may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of Abbott's existing business.   Abbott may also dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, or at all, and may not realize their expected benefits.  9         The expiration of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott's future revenues and operating income.  Many of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced.   Abbott's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in the sections captioned, "Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses" and "Financial Review," and litigation regarding these patents is described in the section captioned "Legal Proceedings."  Competitors' intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.  Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against Abbott could adversely affect Abbott's profitability or financial condition, in some cases materially. Abbott cannot assure that it does not, in fact, infringe upon other's intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into royalty or license agreements. If this should be necessary, Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition.  Abbott is subject to cost-containment efforts.   In the United States and other countries, access to and the cost of human health care products continues to be subject to downward pressure on prices. Cost-containment efforts by the government and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned "Regulation."   In markets outside the United States, Abbott's businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Many countries, directly or indirectly, through limitations on reimbursement or availability, control the selling price of most health care products. To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to healthcare or other factors, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced.  Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.  Abbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the Federal Food and Drug Administration, and numerous other national, supranational, federal and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain governmental authorities outside the United States, can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. Regulation is not static. The suspension, revocation, or adverse amendment of the authority necessary for manufacture, marketing, or sale, and the imposition of additional or different regulatory requirements, such as those affecting labeling can also occur. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues and in substantial additional costs.   In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product. These  10       requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. For example, developers and manufacturers of health care products, including pharmaceutical products, medical devices, and nutritional products must comply with detailed regulations governing current good manufacturing, laboratory and clinical practices, including requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. In the past, Abbott's business has received notices alleging violations of these regulations, and Abbott has modified practices in response to these notices.   Abbott's manufacturing facilities and those of Abbott's suppliers could be subject to significant adverse regulatory actions in the future. These possible regulatory actions could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products and criminal prosecution. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of Abbott's facilities while Abbott remedies the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events, in combination or alone, could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability and financial condition.  Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.  Abbott's industry is also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health Care Act and individual state laws relating to pricing. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott's business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability and financial condition.  If Abbott does not introduce new products in a timely manner, Abbott's products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy Abbott's products, and Abbott's revenue and profitability may decline.  Demand for Abbott's products may change in ways Abbott does not anticipate. This could occur, for example, due to changing customer needs, the introduction by others of new products and technologies, or changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, Abbott's products may become obsolete over time, causing Abbott's revenue and operating results to suffer. Even if Abbott succeeds in creating new product candidates, these candidates may not become commercially successful products.   The success of Abbott's new products will depend on a variety of factors, including Abbott's ability to:    •properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs; •innovate, develop, and manufacture new products in an economical and timely manner; •differentiate Abbott's offerings from competitors' offerings; •achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products;   11          •meet safety requirements and other regulatory requirements of government agencies; •avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties; and •establish and maintain its intellectual property rights.    Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products, these new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by Abbott's competitors of products embodying new technologies or features. Finally, innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice, the need for regulatory clearance, and uncertainty over third-party reimbursement.  The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott's business could suffer.  The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements, which govern their manufacture. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability.  The international nature of Abbott's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.  Abbott's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States make up more than 40% of Abbott's net sales. The risks associated with Abbott's operations outside the United States include:    •changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs; •multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict Abbott's ability to manufacture and sell its products; •differing local product preferences and product requirements; •fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and in interest rates; •trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; •difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing foreign operations; •differing labor regulations; •potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; •political and economic instability; •inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations, and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts; and •diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries.   12           These risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability.  Significant safety issues could arise for Abbott's products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and financial condition.  All health care products, including pharmaceutical products, medical products, and nutritionals, receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies or studies for different indications. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product's label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If serious safety issues with an Abbott product arise, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities.   In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business and reputation and on Abbott's ability to attract and retain customers. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition.  Abbott faces significant competition and may not be able to compete effectively.  Abbott competes with many companies ranging from other multinational companies to small start-up companies. Competition takes many forms, including responding to pricing pressures from managed care groups and government agencies, the development of new products by competitors having lower prices or superior performance or that are otherwise competitive with Abbott's current products, generic competition when Abbott's products lose their patent or regulatory protection, technological advances, patents and registrations obtained by competitors, and business combinations among Abbott's competitors or major customers. Abbott's present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as the result of this competition. Abbott's failure to compete effectively could cause it to lose market share to its competitors and/or have a material adverse effect on its revenues and profitability.  External economic forces, over which Abbott has no control, can have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.  Many external economic forces can affect Abbott's profitability and its financial condition. For example, to calculate its cost for pension and post-employment benefits, Abbott must use the long-term assumptions it has developed with the assistance of its actuaries. These include assumptions regarding the health care cost trend rate, discount (interest) rate, and the expected return on plan assets. Similarly, to determine its stock-based compensation costs, Abbott must develop assumptions regarding the volatility of Abbott's common shares, option life, the associated tax benefit, and discount (interest) rate. These assumptions are based on an analysis of external economic factors over which Abbott has no control. To the extent these factors change over time or actual results differ from these assumptions, Abbott may incur increased costs, some of which may be material.      ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
