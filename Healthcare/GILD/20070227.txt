ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and, therefore, you should not consider any of the above risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.  Substantially all of our revenues are derived from sales of a limited number of products. If we are unable to maintain or continue increasing sales of our HIV products, our results of operations may be adversely affected.  We are currently dependent on sales of our HIV products, especially Truvada and Viread, to support our existing operations. Our HIV products are exclusively of the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. Were the treatment paradigm for HIV to change, causing nucleoside-based therapeutics to fall out of favor, or if we are unable to continue increasing our HIV product sales, our results of operations would likely suffer and we would likely need to scale back our operations, including our spending on research and development efforts. HIV product sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $2.13 billion, or approximately 70% of our total revenues, and sales of Truvada and Viread accounted for 56% and 32%, respectively, of our total HIV product sales in 2006. We may not be able to continue the growth rate of sales of our HIV products for the reasons stated in this risk factor section and, in particular, for the following reasons:        •    As our HIV products are used over a longer period of time in many patients and in combination with other products, and additional studies are conducted, new issues with respect to safety, resistance and interactions with other drugs may arise, which could cause us to provide additional warnings on our labels, narrow our approved indications or halt sales of a product, each of which could reduce our revenues.        •    As a product matures, private insurers and government reimbursers often reduce the amount they will reimburse patients for these products, which increases pressure on us to reduce prices.        •    A large part of the market for our HIV products consists of patients who are already taking other HIV drugs. If we are not successful in encouraging physicians to change patients’ regimens to include our HIV products, the sales of our HIV products will be limited.        •    As generic HIV products are introduced into major markets, our ability to maintain pricing may be affected.    23    Table of Contents If we fail to commercialize new products or expand the indications for existing products, our prospects for future revenues and our stock price may be adversely affected.  If we do not introduce new products or increase revenues from our existing products, we will not be able to increase or maintain our total revenues. Each new product commercialization effort will face the risks outlined in this section. If we fail to increase our sales of our products or bring new products to market, we may not be able to increase revenues and expand our research and development efforts. Although our joint venture with BMS launched the single tablet regimen of Truvada and Sustiva, trade-named Atripla, in July 2006 in the United States, physicians may be reluctant to prescribe Atripla if they fail to see advantages of the single tablet regimen over other antiretrovirals and as a result, we may not be able to increase revenues from our HIV products. In addition, product sales of Atripla may increase at the expense of product sales of its component products and our overall total revenues may not increase from the launch of Atripla. Furthermore, the marketing authorization application submitted by BMS, Merck and us in October 2006 seeking approval of Atripla in the European Union may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all.  We face significant competition.  We face significant competition from businesses that have substantially greater resources than we do. In addition, our competitors have more products and have operated in the fields in which we compete for longer than we have. Our HIV products compete primarily with products from GSK, which markets fixed-dose combination products that compete with Truvada and Atripla. For AmBisome, we are encountering significant competition from new products produced by Merck and Pfizer. In addition, we are aware of reports of at least three lipid formulations that claim similarity to AmBisome becoming available outside of the United States, including the anticipated entry of one such formulation in Greece. These formulations may reduce market demand for AmBisome. Furthermore, the manufacture of lipid formulations of amphotericin B is very complex and if any of these formulations are found to be unsafe, sales of AmBisome may be negatively impacted by association. For Hepsera, we have encountered increased competition with the launch of BMS’s Baraclude (entecavir) and the launch of Novartis/Idenix’s Tyzeka (telbivudine) in the United States. These companies have substantially greater resources than we do and may significantly impede our ability to be successful with our antiviral products and AmBisome. In addition, we are developing aztreonam lysine for inhalation for the treatment of bacterial infections in patients with CF and ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH. If approved, aztreonam lysine would compete with TOBI (tobramycin for inhalation), marketed by Novartis, and ambrisentan would compete directly with Actelion Ltd.’s Tracleer (bosentan), and indirectly with PAH products from United Therapeutics Corporation and Pfizer.  If significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates, our future sales may be reduced, which would adversely affect our results of operations.  The data that support the marketing approvals for our products and that form the basis for the safety warnings in our product labels were obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration and, in some cases, from limited post-approval use. As our products, including Truvada, Viread, Atripla, Emtriva, AmBisome and Hepsera, are used over longer periods of time by many patients taking numerous other medicines, many of whom have underlying health problems, we expect to continue to find new issues such as safety, resistance or drug interaction issues, which may require us to provide additional warnings or contraindications on our labels or narrow our approved indications, each of which could reduce the market acceptance of these products. Safety and efficacy studies of Viread and Emtriva, dosed as separate products, are ongoing and have been underway for a longer period of time than the safety and efficacy studies of Truvada (Viread and Emtriva together), which are also underway. We are also conducting similar studies of Atripla (Viread, Emtriva and Sustiva together). If serious safety, resistance or interaction issues arise with our marketed products, sales of these products could be limited or halted by us or by regulatory authorities.  In addition, following our acquisition of Myogen, we are developing new product candidates (darusentan and ambrisentan) that have a different safety profile than our current marketed products. As these new product     24    Table of Contents  candidates are developed, they may prove to be more susceptible to safety, resistance or drug interaction issues than we have experienced in the past. If safety issues arise with these product candidates, our clinical development programs may be limited or halted by us or by regulatory authorities and the product candidates may never become marketable products.  Our operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to achieve continued compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products.  The products that we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We are continuing clinical trials for Truvada, Viread, Atripla, Emtriva, AmBisome and Hepsera for currently approved and additional uses. We anticipate that we will file for marketing approval in additional countries and for additional products over the next several years. These products may fail to receive marketing approval on a timely basis, or at all.  In addition, our marketed products and how we manufacture and sell these products are subject to extensive continued regulation and review. Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing or promotional activities may result in restrictions on our products, including withdrawal of the products from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we could be subject to penalties including fines, suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products and criminal prosecution.  The results of our clinical trials are uncertain and may not support continued development of a product pipeline, which would adversely affect our prospects for future revenue growth.  We are required to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of products we develop in each intended use through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials. The results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. Even successfully completed large-scale clinical trials may not result in marketable products. If any of our products under development fails to achieve its primary endpoint in clinical trials or if safety issues arise, commercialization of that drug candidate could be delayed or halted. In addition, clinical trials involving our commercial products could raise new safety issues for our existing products, which could in turn reduce our revenues.  Due to our reliance on third-party contract research organizations to conduct clinical trials, we are unable to directly control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials.  We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. We rely on independent third-party contract research organizations (CROs), over which we do not have control, to perform most of our clinical studies, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, program management and bioanalytical analysis. If there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our CROs, our clinical trials may be delayed. Moreover, in our regulatory submissions, we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third-party CROs. If any of our CROs’ processes, methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or inadequate, our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals could be adversely impacted. In February 2007, we were advised by the FDA that it discovered certain irregularities during its inspection of bioanalytical analyses conducted for various organizations by one of our third-party CROs. During the period under review, the CRO performed bioanalytical analyses in studies for certain of our products. We do not know whether the investigation involves or will impact any of our clinical data results or related regulatory approvals.    25    Table of Contents We may not be able to successfully integrate our existing business with the businesses of Corus Pharma, Inc., Raylo Chemicals Inc., and Myogen, Inc.  Integrating these businesses with our existing business will be a complex and time-consuming process. Until recently, Corus, Raylo and Myogen operated independently of us, each with its own business, corporate culture, locations, employees and systems. As a result of these acquisitions, we have to operate our existing business, along with the businesses of Corus, Raylo and Myogen, as one combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls and human resources practices, including benefits, training and professional development programs. There may be substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in the integration of these companies with us and the integration with us of any other company or assets that we may from time to time acquire. The failure to successfully integrate these companies with us, or any other assets or companies we may acquire, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The remaining efforts for completion of Corus’s and Myogen’s research and development projects primarily consist of clinical trials, the cost, length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict, and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. Numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development, including the ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials, and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. Feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical trials might require modifications or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed.  We cannot be certain that aztreonam lysine for CF, purchased from Corus, or ambrisentan for PAH, purchased from Myogen, which is pending FDA review, will be approved in the United States or in countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. Future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for review, which may differ materially from current projections. The acquired product candidates under development may never be successfully commercialized. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of these product candidates if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If either of these programs cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted.  Manufacturing problems could delay product shipments and regulatory approvals, which may adversely affect our results of operations.  We depend on third parties to perform manufacturing activities effectively and on a timely basis for Truvada, Viread, Atripla, Emtriva, Hepsera and Vistide. The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated, and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. We and our manufacturers are subject to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record-keeping and quality standards and similar regulations are in effect in other countries. Our manufacturing operations are also subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies. Additionally, our third-party manufacturers are independent entities who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks which are out of our control. To the extent that these risks materialize and affect their performance obligations to us, it may adversely affect our financial results.  We also depend on these third-party manufacturers to manufacture Truvada, Viread and Atripla made available to physicians and treatment programs at no-profit prices in developing countries under our Gilead Access Program. We rely on these third parties for the manufacture of both the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final drug product for clinical and commercial purposes. In addition, Roche, either by itself or through third parties, is responsible for manufacturing Tamiflu. If any of these third-party manufacturers fail to perform as required, this could impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis or receive royalties or cause     26    Table of Contents  delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. These events could harm our competitive position and financial results.  We may not be able to manufacture AmBisome and Macugen to meet market needs in the event of business interruptions at our San Dimas facility.  We manufacture AmBisome and fill and finish Macugen at our facilities in San Dimas, California, which are our only formulation and manufacturing facilities in the United States. In the event of a natural disaster, including an earthquake, equipment failure, strike or other difficulty, we may be unable to replace this manufacturing capacity in a timely manner and may be unable to manufacture AmBisome and Macugen to meet market needs.  Our ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize aztreonam lysine, if approved, will depend upon our ability to continue to manufacture in a multi-product facility.  Aztreonam lysine is a mono-lactam Gram-negative antibiotic that we currently plan to manufacture, by ourselves or through third parties, in a multi-product manufacturing facility. Historically, the FDA has permitted the manufacture of mono-lactams in multi-product manufacturing facilities, however, there can be no assurances that the FDA will continue to allow this practice. We do not currently have a single-product facility that can be dedicated to the manufacture of aztreonam lysine nor have we engaged a contract manufacturer with a single-product facility for aztreonam lysine. If the FDA prohibits the manufacture of mono-lactam antibiotics, like aztreonam lysine, in multi-product manufacturing facilities in the future, we may not be able to procure a single-product manufacturing facility in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our commercial supplies of aztreonam lysine and our anticipated financial results attributable to such product, if approved.  We may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to manufacture or sell our products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues.  Some of the materials that we utilize in our operations are made at only one facility. For example, we depend on a single supplier for high quality cholesterol, which is used in the manufacture of AmBisome. Because the suppliers of key components and materials must be named in the NDA filed with the FDA for a product, significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required. If delivery of material from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason, we may be unable to ship Truvada, Viread, Atripla, Emtriva, Hepsera, AmBisome or Vistide, or to supply any of our products in development for clinical trials. In addition, the aztreonam lysine for inhalation that we are developing is administered to the lungs of patients through a device that is made by a single supplier. We are currently working with the supplier to prepare for the commercial launch of aztreonam lysine for inhalation, if and when regulatory approval is obtained. If sufficient quantities of this device are not available at the time of a commercial launch or following such a launch or if we encounter problems in our relationship with the supplier, the commercial launch of aztreonam lysine for inhalation could be delayed, and the anticipated contribution of aztreonam lysine to our financial results could be adversely effected.    27    Table of Contents We depend on relationships with other companies for sales and marketing performance and revenues. Failure to maintain these relationships, poor performance by these companies or disputes with these other companies could negatively impact our business.  We rely on a number of significant collaborative relationships with major pharmaceutical companies for our sales and marketing performance in certain territories. These include collaborations with Astellas (created through the merger of Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) and Sumitomo for AmBisome, GSK for Hepsera, Roche for Tamiflu, Pfizer for Vistide, OSI and Pfizer for Macugen, Japan Tobacco for Viread, Truvada and Emtriva and our joint venture with BMS for Atripla. In many countries, we rely on international distributors for sales of Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, AmBisome and Hepsera. Some of these relationships also involve the clinical development of these products by our partners. Reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including:        •    the risk that we are not able to control the resources our corporate partners devote to our programs or products;        •    disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of rights to technology developed with corporate partners;        •    disagreements with corporate partners could cause delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of product candidates or result in litigation or arbitration;        •    contracts with our corporate partners may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if one of these partners fails to perform;        •    corporate partners have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional products and may pursue alternative technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors;        •    corporate partners with marketing rights may choose to pursue competing technologies or to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our products than they do to products of their own development; and        •    our distributors and corporate partners may be unable to pay us.  Given these risks, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed or revenue from existing products could decline.  Under our April 2002 licensing agreement with GSK, we gave GSK the right to control clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of Hepsera in territories in Asia, Africa and Latin America. These include major markets for Hepsera, such as China, Japan, Taiwan and The Republic of Korea. The success of Hepsera in these territories will depend almost entirely on the efforts of GSK. In this regard, GSK promotes Epivir-HBV/Zeffix, a product that competes with Hepsera. Consequently, GSK’s marketing strategy for Hepsera may be influenced by its promotion of Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. We receive royalties from GSK equal to a percentage of GSK’s net sales of Hepsera as well as net sales of GSK’s Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. If GSK fails to devote sufficient resources to, or does not succeed in developing or commercializing Hepsera in its territories, our potential revenues from sales of Hepsera from these territories may be substantially reduced.  Expenses associated with clinical trials and sales fluctuations as a result of inventory levels held by wholesalers may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price.  The clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our products, as well as clinical trials we are required to conduct after approval, are very expensive. It is difficult to accurately predict or control the amount or timing of these expenses from quarter to quarter. Uneven and unexpected spending on these programs may cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.    28    Table of Contents We estimate the future demand for our product, consider the shelf life of our inventory and regularly review the realizability of our inventory. If actual demand is less than our estimated demand, we could be required to record inventory write-downs, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations. For example, as a result of our review of inventory realizability, during the first and fourth quarters of 2006, we recorded write-downs of a portion of our Gilead Access Program inventory. Additional write downs of inventory for our Gilead Access Program may be necessary if demand for our HIV products in the Access Program countries is not sufficient to consume existing inventories.  During the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 87% of our product sales in the United States were to three wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen Corp., Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corp. Inventory levels held by those wholesalers can cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to wholesalers do not match end user demand. The U.S. wholesalers with whom we have entered into inventory management agreements may not be completely effective in matching inventory levels to end user demand, as they make estimates to determine end user demand. The non-retail sector in the United States, which includes government institutions, correctional facilities and large health maintenance organizations, which currently contributes to approximately 30% of our HIV business, tends to be less consistent in terms of buying patterns, and often results in quarter over quarter fluctuations that do not necessarily mirror the growth patterns that can be seen in the retail prescription data. The unpredictable variability of Roche’s Tamiflu sales and the strong relationship between this revenue and global pandemic planning also cause our royalty revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.  Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to protect our patents and other intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally.  We have a number of patents, patent applications and rights to patents related to the compounds in our products, but we cannot be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents. Competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our patents. Patent applications are confidential for at least some period of time until a patent is issued. As a result, we may not know if our competitors filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent the technology that is the subject of our patent applications. If competitors file patent applications covering our technology, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or litigation to determine the right to a patent. Litigation and interference proceedings are expensive even if we are ultimately successful.  As part of the approval process of some of our products, the FDA has determined that the products would be granted an exclusivity period during which other manufacturers’ applications for approval of our products will not be granted. Generic manufacturers often wait to challenge the patents protecting products until one year prior to the end of the exclusivity period. From time to time, we have received notices from manufacturers indicating that they intend to import chemical intermediates possibly for use in making our products. It is, therefore, possible that generic manufacturers are considering attempts to seek FDA approval for a similar or identical drug through an abbreviated new drug application, which is the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. If our patents are subject to challenges, we may need to spend significant resources to defend such challenges and we may not be able to defend our patents successfully.  Our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.  If we infringe the patents of others, we may be prevented from commercializing products or may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties. We may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain such licenses or alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products.    29    Table of Contents In addition, we use significant proprietary technology and rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect certain aspects of our production and other technologies. Our trade secrets may become known or independently discovered by our competitors.  Approximately half of our product sales occur outside the United States, and currency fluctuations may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price.  A significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in the past have reduced, and in the future may reduce, our U.S. dollar equivalent sales and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro currency. We also hedge a portion of our accounts receivable balances denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a sale is recorded and the date that cash is collected. Our hedging program only hedges a portion of our total exposure and significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations within a short period of time could adversely affect our results of operations.  We face credit risks from our European customers that may adversely affect our results of operations.  Our European product sales to government owned or supported customers in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. Our accounts receivable from government-owned or supported customers in these countries totaled $330.5 million as of December 31, 2006. Historically, receivables tended to accumulate over a period of time and were settled as large lump sum payments as government funding became available. If significant changes were to occur in the reimbursement practices of these European governments or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from these customers and our results of operations would be adversely affected.  Our product revenues could be reduced by imports from countries where our products are available at lower prices.  Prices for our products are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country. Our sales in countries with relatively higher prices may be reduced if products can be imported into those or other countries from lower price markets. There have been cases in which other pharmaceutical products were sold at steeply discounted prices in the developing world and then re-exported to European countries where they could be re-sold at much higher prices. If this happens with our products, particularly Truvada and Viread, which we have agreed to make available at no-profit prices to 97 countries participating in our Gilead Access Program, or Atripla, which Merck will distribute at low cost to HIV-infected patients in developing countries under our August 2006 agreement, our revenues would be adversely affected. In addition, we have granted non-exclusive, voluntary licenses for the manufacture of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to 11 generic manufacturers in India for the local Indian market and for manufacturers to export product to 95 of the developing world countries included in our Gilead Access Program. If generic versions of Viread under these licenses are then re-exported to the United States, Europe or other markets outside of India or the 97 developing world countries participating in our Gilead Access Program, our revenues would be adversely affected.  In addition, in the European Union, we are required to permit cross-border sales. This allows buyers in countries where government-approved prices for our products are relatively high to purchase our products legally from countries where they are sold at lower prices. Purchases of our products in countries where our sales prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our sales prices are relatively high may adversely impact our gross margin and may cause our sales to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we have seen increased instances of such cross-border sales in Europe. Additionally, some U.S. consumers have been able to purchase products, including HIV products, from internet pharmacies in other countries at substantial discounts. Such cross-border sales could adversely affect our revenues.    30    Table of Contents In some countries, we may be required to grant compulsory licenses for our products or face generic competition for our products.  In a number of developing countries, government officials and other groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs for HIV infection available at a low cost. Alternatively, governments in those countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products, thereby reducing our product sales. For example, in the past, certain offices of the government of Brazil have expressed concern over the affordability of our HIV products and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory licenses to permit the manufacture of otherwise patented products for HIV infection, including Viread. As a result of discussions with the Brazilian government, we reached agreement with the Brazilian Health Ministry in May 2006 to reduce the price of Viread in Brazil by approximately 50%. In addition, concerns over the cost and availability of Tamiflu as fear grows about a potential avian flu pandemic have generated international discussions over potential compulsory licensing of our Tamiflu patents. For example, we are aware that the Canadian government is considering measures that would allow Canadian manufacturers to manufacture and sell the active ingredient in Tamiflu in Canada and certain other countries. Furthermore, Roche may issue voluntary licenses to permit third-party manufacturing of Tamiflu. For example, Roche has granted a sublicense to Shanghai Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. for China and a sublicense to India’s Hetero Drugs Limited for India and certain developing countries. Should one or more compulsory licenses be issued permitting generic manufacturing to override our Tamiflu patents, or should Roche issue additional voluntary licenses to permit third-party manufacturing of Tamiflu, those developments could reduce royalties we receive from Roche’s sales of Tamiflu. Certain countries do not permit enforcement of our patents, and manufacturers are able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries. Compulsory licenses or sales of generic versions of our products could significantly reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if generic versions of our products are imported into territories where we have existing commercial sales.  Our existing products are subject to reimbursement from government agencies and other third parties. Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressures may reduce profitability.  Successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of governmental and third-party payor reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement. Government authorities and third-party payors increasingly are challenging the price of medical products and services, particularly for innovative new products and therapies. This has resulted in lower average sales prices. For example, a majority of our sales of AmBisome and Vistide, and a majority of our sales of Truvada, Viread, Atripla and Hepsera, are subject to reimbursement by government agencies, resulting in significant discounts from list price and rebate obligations. Our business may be adversely affected by an increase in U.S. or international pricing pressures. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and health care reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.  In Europe, the success of Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera, AmBisome and Tamiflu, as well as Atripla, if and when approved in the European Union, will also depend largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement because in many European countries, patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In addition, negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization by twelve months or more. We also expect that the success of our products in development, particularly in Europe, will depend on the ability to obtain reimbursement. Even if reimbursement is available, reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. For example, in Europe as in many international markets, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals and expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as volumes increase. As new drugs come to market, we may face significant price decreases for our products across much of Europe. We believe that this will continue into the foreseeable future as governments struggle with escalating health care     31    Table of Contents  spending. As a result of these pricing practices, it may become difficult to maintain our historic levels of profitability or to achieve expected rates of growth.  Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future health care reforms.  Legislative and regulatory changes to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Recently, there have been significant changes to the federal Medicare system in the United States that could impact the pricing of our products. Under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, Medicare beneficiaries are now able to elect coverage for prescription drugs under Medicare Part D, and the various entities providing such coverage will attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers, which may increase pressure to lower prescription drug prices and may limit drug access. The prescription drug program began on January 1, 2006 and although we have benefited initially from patients transitioning from Medicaid to Medicare Part D in 2006, the longer term impact of this new law on our business is not yet clear to us, and the impact will depend in part on specific decisions regarding the level of coverage provided for the therapeutic categories in which our products are included, the terms on which such coverage is provided, and the extent to which preference is given to selected products in a category. Further, Medicare patients will have to pay co-insurance, which may influence which products are recommended by physicians and selected by patients. These changes in Medicare reimbursement could have a negative effect on revenues. Federal Medicare proposals, along with State Medicaid drug payment changes and healthcare reforms could also lower payment for our products. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the reimbursement changes emerging from the Medicare prescription drug coverage legislation. In addition, to the extent that private insurers such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield or managed care programs follow Medicaid coverage and payment developments, the adverse effects of lower Medicare payment may be magnified by private insurers adopting lower payment schedules. Additionally, some states have enacted health care reform legislation. Further federal and state developments are possible.  We may not be able to obtain effective patents to protect our technologies from use by competitors and patents of other companies could require us to stop using or pay for the use of required technology.  Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to:        •    obtain patents and licenses to patent rights;        •    preserve trade secrets; and        •    operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others.  We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications and rights to patents related to our compounds, products and technology. There is a risk, however, that issued patents will not be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will not result in issued patents. Patent applications are confidential for at least some period of time until a patent is issued. As a result, we may not know if our competitors filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent the technology that is the subject of our patent applications. Competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our patents.  Patents do not cover the active ingredients in AmBisome. In addition, we do not have patent filings in China or certain other Asian countries covering all forms of adefovir dipivoxil, the active ingredient in Hepsera. Asia is a major market for therapies for HBV, the indication for which Hepsera has been developed. Flolan’s patent and market exclusivity protection has expired. As a result, one or more generic pharmaceutical companies may launch, or attempt to launch, a generic version of Flolan in the United States in 2007 or thereafter.  We may obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained for those products. Because patents have a limited life, which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related     32    Table of Contents  product, the commercial value of the patent may be limited. However, we may be able to apply for patent term extensions. In addition, certain countries in Africa and Asia, including China do not permit enforcement of our patents, and manufacturers are able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries.  Our competitors may file patent applications covering our technology. If so, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or litigation to determine the right to a patent. Litigation and interference proceedings are expensive even if we are ultimately successful.  As part of the approval process of some of our products, the FDA has determined that the products would be granted an exclusivity period during which other manufacturers’ applications for approval of generic versions of our product will not be granted. Generic manufacturers often wait to challenge the patents protecting products that have been granted exclusivity until one year prior to the end of the exclusivity period. From time to time, we have received notices from manufacturers indicating that they intend to import chemical intermediates possibly for use in making our products. It is, therefore, possible that generic manufacturers are considering attempts to seek FDA approval for a similar or identical drug through an Abbreviated NDA, which is the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. If our patents are subject to challenges, we may need to spend significant resources to defend such challenges and we may not be able to defend our patents successfully.  Our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. If we infringe the patents of others, we may be prevented from commercializing products or may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties. We may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain such licenses or alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products.  In addition, we use significant proprietary technology and rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect certain aspects of our production and other technologies. Our trade secrets may become known or independently discovered by our competitors.  We may face significant liability resulting from our products that may not be covered by insurance and successful claims could materially reduce our earnings.  The testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our commercial products, as well as products in development, involve substantial risk of product liability claims. These claims may be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others. Our product liability insurance may not cover a successful product liability claim against us and we could be required to pay amounts beyond that provided by our insurance, either of which could impair our financial condition and our ability to clinically test and to market our products.  Our assumptions used to determine our self-insurance levels could be wrong and materially impact our business.  We continually evaluate our levels of self-insurance based on historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. However, if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends, our results of operations, business, cash flow and financial condition could be materially impacted by claims and other expenses.  Expensive litigation and government investigations may reduce our earnings.  We are named as a defendant in lawsuits regarding the use of average wholesale price and reimbursement rates under Medicaid. In addition, the plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal of a class action lawsuit brought against us alleging violations of federal securities laws. In November 2006, we received a subpoena from the     33    Table of Contents  United States Attorney’s Office in San Francisco requesting documents regarding our marketing and medical education programs for Truvada, Viread and Emtriva. We are complying with the U.S. Attorney’s subpoena and intend to cooperate with any related government investigation. The outcome of these lawsuits, any other lawsuits brought against us, the investigation, or any other such investigations brought against us, are inherently uncertain, and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us that could significantly reduce our earnings and cash flows.  Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.  Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R) relating to the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, changes in tax laws and rates, mergers and acquisitions, future levels of research and development (R&D) spending, changes in accounting standards, future levels of capital expenditures, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings and finalization of federal and state income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above-mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income or loss.  Changes in accounting for stock options has significantly reduced and will continue to significantly reduce our earnings.  We are subject to SFAS 123R, under which we have been required to record additional compensation expense related to stock options and other share-based payments since January 1, 2006. This standard has had and will continue to have a significant negative impact on our reported results of operations compared to the results we reported prior to 2006 under prior accounting standards on stock options and other share-based payments.  If we fail to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop new product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates.  Our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, governmental regulation and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense, and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms. If we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts, our business may be harmed.   ITEM 1B.
