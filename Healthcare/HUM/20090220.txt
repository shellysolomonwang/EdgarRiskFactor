ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  If the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of benefits payable or future policy benefits payable based upon our estimates of future benefit claims are inadequate, our profitability could be materially adversely affected.  We use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members. These costs include claims payments, capitation payments, and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members. These costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members. Generally, premiums in the health care business are fixed for one-year periods. Accordingly, costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. We estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical inflation, historical developments, including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors. We also record benefits payable for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends. Many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums. These factors may include:        •    increased use of medical facilities and services, including prescription drugs;        •    increased cost of such services;        •    our membership mix;        •    variances in actual versus estimated levels of cost associated with new products, benefits or lines of business, product changes or benefit level changes;        •    changes in the demographic characteristics of an account or market;        •    changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services, concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals;        •    possible changes in our pharmacy rebate program with drug manufacturers;        •    catastrophes, including acts of terrorism, public health epidemics, or severe weather (e.g. hurricanes and earthquakes);        •    the introduction of new or costly treatments, including new technologies;        •    medical cost inflation; and        •    government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes.  In addition, we also estimate costs associated with long-duration insurance policies including life insurance, annuities, health, and long-term care policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years. These future policy benefit reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables, modified based upon actual experience. The basis for the liability for future policy benefits is established at the time each contract is acquired and would only change if our experience deteriorates to the point the level of the liability is not adequate to provide for future policy benefits. Future policy benefits payable include $503.2 million at December 31, 2008 associated with a closed block of long-term care policies acquired in connection with the November 30, 2007 KMG acquisition. Long-term care policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established. The risk of a deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block     17    Table of Contents  of long-term care policies. We monitor the loss experience of these long-term care policies, and, when necessary, apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold. We expect to file premium rate increases in 2009. To the extent premium rate increases or loss experience vary from our acquisition date assumptions, future adjustments to reserves could be required.  Failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or future policy benefits payable may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  If we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, our membership and profitability could be materially adversely affected.  We are in a highly competitive industry. Some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets. In addition, other companies may enter our markets in the future, including emerging competitors in the Medicare program as well as in Smart plans and other consumer health plans, such as high deductible health plans with Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). We believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial, so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. Contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually. While health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service and the quality and depth of provider networks, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. In addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs, we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices. Factors such as business consolidations, strategic alliances, legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases, despite being faced with increasing medical costs.  Premium increases, introduction of new product designs, and our relationship with our providers in various markets, among other issues, could also affect our membership levels. Other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into Medicare or Commercial markets, or the termination of a large contract, including our TRICARE contract.  If we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share, if membership does not increase as we expect, if membership declines, or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.  If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, including our Medicare initiatives, our business could be materially adversely affected.  Our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position the Company for the future. This strategy includes opportunities created by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA. The MMA offers opportunities in our Medicare programs including our HMO and PPO, as well as our stand-alone PDP products. We have made substantial investments in the Medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs. The expansion of our provider networks and our success in attracting increasing numbers of PFFS members to our network-based products positions us well for changes in the Medicare program that will effectively eliminate the PFFS plan option in 2011, although there can be no assurances that our PFFS members will choose to move to our network-based products. Over the last few years we have increased the size of our Medicare geographic reach since the enactment of the MMA through expanded Medicare product offerings. We are offering both the stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage and Medicare Advantage Health Plan with Prescription Drug Coverage in addition to our other product offerings. We offer the Medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.    18    Table of Contents The growth of our Medicare business is an important part of our business strategy. Any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In addition, the expansion of our Medicare business in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in the Medicare business. These expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream.  Additionally, our strategy includes the growth of our Commercial segment business, with emphasis on our ASO and individual products, introduction of new products and benefit designs, including our Smart plans and other consumer offerings such as HSAs, and our specialty products such as dental, vision and other supplemental products, as well as the adoption of new technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position us for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted or adopted in the time periods assumed. Failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  If we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems, our business could be materially adversely affected.  Our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business. Our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, provide effective and efficient service to our customers, and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of our past and on-going acquisition activities, we have acquired additional information systems. We have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate, have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities, and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity, we could have operational disruptions, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes, have regulatory or other legal problems, have increases in operating expenses, lose existing customers, have difficulty in attracting new customers, or suffer other adverse consequences.  We depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systems-related support, equipment, facilities, and certain data, including data center operations, data network, voice communication services and pharmacy data processing. This dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the contract, due to internal or external factors. A change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results.  We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry. We expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows.  Our business plans also include becoming a quality e-business organization by enhancing interactions with customers, brokers, agents, and other stakeholders through web-enabling technology. Our strategy includes sales and distribution of health benefit products through the Internet, and implementation of advanced self-service capabilities, for internal and external stakeholders.    19    Table of Contents There can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support our expanding operations, integrating new systems, protecting our proprietary information, and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  We are involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages.  We are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business, including employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, securities laws claims, and tort claims.  In addition, because of the nature of the health care business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of products and services. These include and could include in the future:        •    claims relating to the methodologies for calculating premiums;        •    claims relating to the denial of health care benefit payments;        •    claims relating to the denial or rescission of insurance coverage;        •    challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims;        •    claims relating to our administration of our Medicare Part D offerings;        •    medical malpractice actions based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for our providers’ alleged malpractice;        •    allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities;        •    provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts;        •    disputes related to ASO business, including actions alleging claim administration errors;        •    claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices;        •    claims relating to customer audits and contract performance; and        •    claims relating to dispensing of drugs associated with our in-house mail-order pharmacy.  In some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal False Claims Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other statutes may be sought. While we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. Additionally, the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly. As a result, we have increased the amount of risk that we self-insure, particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business. In addition, some types of damages, like punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance. In some jurisdictions, coverage of punitive damages is prohibited. Insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future.  The health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry. This publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation, including some large jury awards, legislative activity, regulation, and governmental review of industry practices. These factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services, may require us to change our products or services, may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate, and may require us to pay large judgments or fines. Any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.    20    Table of Contents See “Legal Proceedings” in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty.  As a government contractor, we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs.  A significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs, including the Medicare, Military, and Medicaid programs. Our Government segment accounted for approximately 74% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2008. These programs involve various risks, as described further below.        •    At December 31, 2008, under our contracts with CMS we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 492,700 Medicare members in Florida. These contracts accounted for approximately 16% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2008. The loss of these and other CMS contracts or significant changes in the Medicare program as a result of legislative or regulatory action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.        •    At December 31, 2008, our military services business, which accounted for approximately 12% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily consisted of the TRICARE South Region contract which covers approximately 3.0 million beneficiaries. The 5-year South Region contract, which expires March 31, 2009, was subject to annual renewals on April 1 of each year at the government’s option. On January 16, 2009, we entered into an Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract to the TRICARE South Region contract. The Amendment added one additional one-year option period, the sixth option period, which runs from April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010, and two additional six-month option periods: the seventh option period runs from April 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010 and the eighth option period runs from October 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011. Exercise of each of the sixth, seventh, and eighth option periods is at the government’s option. Under these extensions, government requirements, terms and conditions will remain the same as the current contract. On January 22, 2009, we were notified by the government of its intent to exercise its option to extend the TRICARE contract for the sixth option period. As required under the contract, the target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee amounts for each option period are negotiated. Any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government. Accordingly, events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount could have a material adverse effect on us. These changes may include, for example, an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease U.S. military deployments. In the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  On March 24, 2008, the Department of Defense issued its formal request for proposal for new contracts for TRICARE medical benefits nationwide. We submitted our bid in June 2008 and, after discussions with the Department of Defense, submitted our final proposal revisions in January 2009. If we are not awarded a new TRICARE contract, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.        •    At December 31, 2008, under our contracts with the Puerto Rico Insurance Administration and Puerto Rico Health Administration, we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 341,700 Medicaid members in Puerto Rico. These contracts accounted for approximately 2% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2008.  In August 2008, we renewed our contracts with the Puerto Rico Insurance Administration for the East and Southeast regions. These contracts expire on June 30, 2009. The loss of these contracts or     21    Table of Contents  significant changes in the Puerto Rico Medicaid program as a result of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  We also provided services under a three-year ASO contract with the Puerto Rico Health Administration for the Metro North Region. The Puerto Rico Health Administration did not renew the third year of the ASO contract and the contract expired on September 30, 2008. The loss of this contract did not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.        •    There is a possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal False Claims Act.        •    CMS utilizes a risk-adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to Medicare Advantage plans according to health severity. A risk-adjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all Medicare Advantage plans must collect, capture and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician providers to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to Medicare Advantage plans.  CMS has announced that it will perform audits of selected Medicare Advantage plans each year to validate the provider coding practices under the risk-adjustment model used to reimburse Medicare Advantage plans. These audits will involve a comprehensive review of medical records, and may result in contract-level payment adjustments to premium payments made to a health plan pursuant to its Medicare contract with CMS or other payment reductions. The first data validation audits will focus on risk-adjustment data for 2006 used to determine 2007 payment amounts.  Several Humana contracts are included in audits being undertaken by CMS. If necessary, based on audit results, CMS may make contract-level payment adjustments that may occur during 2009, and adjustments may occur prior to Humana or other Medicare Advantage plans having the opportunity to appeal audit findings. We primarily rely on providers to appropriately document risk-adjustment data in their medical records and appropriately code their claim submissions, which we send to CMS as the basis for our risk-adjustment model premium. We are working with CMS and our industry group to develop an orderly audit process, for which CMS has not yet indicated the complete details. Therefore, we are unable to predict the complete audit methodology to be used by CMS, the outcome of these audits, or whether these audits would result in a payment adjustment. However, it is reasonably possible that a payment adjustment as a result of these audits could occur, and that any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.        •    Our CMS contracts which cover members’ prescription drugs under the Part D provisions of the MMA contain provisions for 1) risk sharing and 2) reimbursements of prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk.  The premiums from CMS are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in CMS making additional payments to us or require us to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums we received. We estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience. The estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain, including member eligibility differences with CMS. Beginning in 2008, the risk corridor thresholds increased which means we bear more risk. Our estimate of the settlement associated with the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions was a net receivable of $55.4 million at December 31, 2008.    22    Table of Contents Reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies represent reimbursements from CMS in connection with the Medicare Part D program for which we assume no risk. Reinsurance subsidies represent reimbursements for CMS’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s out-of-pocket threshold, or the catastrophic coverage level. Low-income cost subsidies represent reimbursements from CMS for all or a portion of the deductible, the coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold for low-income beneficiaries. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. A reconciliation and settlement of CMS’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year.  Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. This reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for CMS to administer the program. Our claims data may not pass CMS’s claims edit processes due to various reasons, including but not limited to, discrepancies in eligibility or classification of low-income members. To the extent our data does not pass CMS’s claim edit processes, we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or reimbursement as a low-income or reinsurance claim. In addition, in the event the settlement represents an amount CMS owes us, there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing CMS’s share of the risk. The opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe CMS.  Other risks could include:        •    future changes to these government programs which may affect our ability or willingness to participate in these programs;        •    higher comparative medical costs;        •    government regulatory and reporting requirements; and        •    higher marketing and advertising costs per member as a result of marketing to individuals as opposed to groups.  Our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative change, could increase our costs of doing business and could materially adversely affect our profitability.  The health care industry in general and health insurance, particularly HMOs and PPOs, are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation.  The enactment of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, or the Act, in July 2008 could affect our Medicare operations. Principally, beginning in 2011 sponsors of Medicare Advantage PFFS plans will be required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks, except in geographic areas that CMS determines have fewer than two network-based Medicare Advantage plans. Additionally, the Act prohibits several different kinds of marketing activities by Medicare plan sponsors and their brokers beginning in 2009, and will phase out indirect medical education (IME) costs beginning in 2010. We are implementing various operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to answer the challenges presented by the Act. In addition, most of our PFFS enrollees reside in geographies where we have developed a PPO network and offer a PPO plan. We will continue to develop our PPO network and build network-based plan offerings to address the network restriction. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement those initiatives. Failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  Our licensed subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and Puerto Rico regulations. These regulations generally require, among other things, prior approval and/or notice of new products, rates, benefit changes, and certain material transactions, including dividend payments, purchases or sales of assets, intercompany agreements, and the filing of various financial and operational reports.    23    Table of Contents Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required.  Although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Based on the statutory financial statements as of December 31, 2008, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $3.5 billion in our state regulated subsidiaries, $1.4 billion above the aggregate $2.1 billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states.  The use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data. Most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. HIPAA includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions, establishing uniform health care provider, payer, and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data. The rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws, but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent.  These regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information. Violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties, including significant monetary penalties. Compliance with HIPAA regulations requires significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. HIPAA can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates. A business associate is a person or entity, other than a member of the work force, who on behalf of a covered entity performs or assists in the performance of a function or activity involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or provides legal, accounting, consulting, data aggregation, management, administrative, accreditation, or financial services.  Laws in each of the states (including Puerto Rico) in which we operate our HMOs, PPOs and other health insurance-related services regulate our operations, including the scope of benefits, rate formulas, delivery systems, utilization review procedures, quality assurance, complaint systems, enrollment requirements, claim payments, marketing, and advertising. The HMO, PPO, and other health insurance-related products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators. Our licensed subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and Puerto Rico regulations.  We are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations. Under state laws, our HMOs and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance. Our HMOs are audited for compliance with health services by state departments of health. Audits and investigations are also conducted by state attorneys general, CMS, the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency. All of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs, or the imposition of fines, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services.  Other areas subject to substantial regulation include:        •    licensing requirements;        •    approval of policy language and benefits;        •    mandated benefits and processes;    24    Table of Contents     •    approval of entry, withdrawal or re-entry into a state or market;        •    premium rates; and        •    periodic examinations by state and federal agencies.  Two areas of legislation that can impact the company are experiencing continued activity. These are Medicare funding under MMA and proposals to expand health insurance coverage. MMA funding and associated program structure is an area of substantial legislative attention that may be influenced by federal budget considerations and Medicare spending trends. The federal and state efforts to expand access to health coverage may offer opportunities to serve individuals who are not currently in the health insurance market through public program expansions, coverage connectors or premium assistance programs. Current state fiscal conditions may affect the scope and scale of proposals. Some access proposals also include increased regulation of our commercial business, particularly small group and individual, through a combination of benefit mandates, underwriting restrictions, rating limitations and assessments.  State and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to:        •    health insurance access and affordability;        •    regulation of broker licensing and commission rates, particularly in the Medicare marketing area;        •    e-connectivity and electronic health records;        •    universal health coverage;        •    disclosure of provider fee schedules and other data about payments to providers, sometimes called transparency;        •    disclosure of provider quality information; and        •    formation of regional purchasing pools for small employers and individuals.  All of these proposals could apply to us and could result in new regulations that increase the cost of our operations.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory change will not have a material adverse effect on us. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals could adversely affect entry into new markets, our revenues or the number of our members, increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted.  We are also subject to potential changes in the political environment that can affect public policy and can adversely affect the markets for our products.  While it is not possible to predict when and whether fundamental policy changes would occur, these could include policy changes on the local, state, and federal level that could fundamentally change the dynamics of our industry, such as a larger role of the government in the health care arena. Changes in public policy could materially affect our profitability and cash flow, our ability to retain or grow our business, and our financial position.  Any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper profitability.  The level of our administrative expenses impacts our profitability. While we proactively attempt to effectively manage such expenses, increases in staff-related expenses, investment in new products, including our opportunities in the Medicare programs, greater emphasis on small group and individual health insurance products, acquisitions, and implementation of regulatory requirements, among others, may occur from time to time.    25    Table of Contents There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contain our administrative expenses in line with our membership and this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  Any failure by us to manage acquisitions, and other significant transactions successfully could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.  As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees. Integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions, or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. In 2008, we acquired UnitedHealth Group’s Las Vegas, Nevada individual SecureHorizons Medicare Advantage HMO business, OSF Health Plans, Inc., Metcare Health Plans, Inc., and PHP Companies, Inc. (d/b/a Cariten Healthcare), and in late 2007, we acquired KMG America Corporation and CompBenefits Corporation. The failure to successfully integrate these entities and businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. If we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally. We may also be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business could be adversely affected.  We contract with physicians, hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members. Our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers. These providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner.  In any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us, less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, some providers, particularly hospitals, physician specialty groups, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions and negotiating power. In addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected.  In some situations, we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined, fixed, per-member-per-month fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members. This type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract. The inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us. In addition, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. The financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider. There can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations.    26    Table of Contents Our mail-order pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses.  Our mail-order pharmacy business, opened in 2006, competes with locally owned drugstores, retail drugstore chains, supermarkets, discount retailers, membership clubs, Internet companies as well as other mail-order and long-term care pharmacies. It also subjects us to extensive federal, state and local regulation. We are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products, and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mail-services pharmacies. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our pharmacy subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties.  Our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted.  Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of Humana Inc., our parent company. These subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ Departments of Insurance. We are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated. A significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from our parent company. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts, or, in some states, any amount. In addition, we normally notify the state Departments of Insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval. In the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of Humana Inc., our operations or financial position may be adversely affected.  Downgrades in our debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Claims paying ability, financial strength, and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. Our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders, but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such.  Historically, rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to, among other things, perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency, the competitive environment in the insurance industry, the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims, the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations, and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. In addition, rating agencies have come under recent regulatory and public scrutiny over the ratings assigned to various fixed-income products. As a result, rating agencies may (i) become more conservative in their methodology and criteria, (ii) increase the frequency or scope of their credit reviews, (iii) request additional information from the companies that they rate, or (iv) adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.  We believe that some of our customers place importance on our credit ratings, and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded. In addition, our credit ratings affect our ability to obtain investment capital on favorable terms. If our credit ratings were to be lowered, our cost of borrowing likely would increase, our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.    27    Table of Contents Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  The current recession and overall state of the U.S. economy could adversely affect our employer group and individual business, including Medicare, renewal prospects and our ability to collect or increase premiums. The state of the U.S. economy could also adversely affect the budget of individual states and of the federal government. That could result in attempts to reduce payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including the Medicare, military services, and Medicaid programs, and could result in an increase in taxes and assessments on our activities. Although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through, among other things, increases in premiums, there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  In addition, general inflationary pressures may affect the costs of medical and dental care, increasing the costs of paying claims.  We are also subject to extensive laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities and non-governmental self-regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, foreign regulators, state insurance regulators, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Stock Exchange, the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. In light of the difficult economic conditions, some of these authorities are considering or may in the future consider enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or to otherwise assure the stability of institutions under their supervision. These authorities may also seek to exercise their supervisory or enforcement authority in new or more robust ways. All of these possibilities, if they occurred, could affect the way we conduct our business and manage our capital, either of which in turn could have a material adverse effect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  The securities and credit markets recently have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption.  The volatility and disruption in the securities and credit markets has impacted our investment portfolio. We evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. For the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses, the cost of investment securities is based upon specific identification. In analyzing individual securities for other-than-temporary impairments, we consider factors affecting the issuer, factors affecting the industry within which the issuer operates, and general debt and equity market trends. We also consider the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below its carrying value, the severity of the decline, the near-term prospects for recovery to cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized. During 2008, we realized losses associated with other-than-temporary impairments of $103.1 million. Gross unrealized losses were $313.0 million and gross unrealized gains were $83.2 million at December 31, 2008.  Given current market conditions, there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods.  We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements. However, continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions could significantly affect the availability of credit. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  Our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, both to the overall market and our industry, our credit ratings and debt capacity, as well as     28    Table of Contents  the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us. If a combination of these factors were to occur, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.  Given the current economic climate, our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility.  Recently, the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume volatility. Company-specific issues and market developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may have caused this volatility. Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to materially fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including:        •    general economic conditions;        •    quarterly variations in operating results;        •    natural disasters, terrorist attacks and epidemics;        •    changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;        •    operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable;        •    press releases or negative publicity relating to our competitors or us or relating to trends in our markets;        •    regulatory changes and adverse outcomes from litigation and government or regulatory investigations;        •    sales of stock by insiders;        •    changes in our credit ratings;        •    limitations on premium levels or the ability to raise premiums on existing policies;        •    increases in minimum capital, reserves, and other financial strength requirements; and        •    limitations on our ability to repurchase our common stock.  These factors could materially reduce our stock price. In addition, broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.      ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
