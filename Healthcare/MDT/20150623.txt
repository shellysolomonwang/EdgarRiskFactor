Item 1A. Risk Factors - Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business."Acquisition of Covidien plcOn January 26, 2015, pursuant to a transaction agreement, dated as of June 15, 2014 (the Transaction Agreement), Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien became subsidiaries of the Company. The total cash and stock value of the Covidien acquisition was approximately $50 billion. The operating results for Covidien are included in the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, Cardiac and Vascular Group and Restorative Therapies Group segments. Based upon a preliminary acquisition valuation, the Company acquired $18.3 billion of customer-related intangible assets, $7.1 billion of technology-based intangible assets, $0.5 billion of tradenames, with weighted average estimated useful lives of 18, 16, and 3 years, respectively, $0.4 billion of in-process research and development (IPR&D), and $29.6 billion of goodwill.Other Fiscal Year 2015 AcquisitionsSophono, Inc.On March 26, 2015, the Company acquired Sophono, Inc. (Sophono), a privately-held developer and manufacturer of minimally invasive, transcutaneous bone conduction hearing implants. Total consideration for the transaction was approximately $17 million, which included an upfront payment of $6 million and the estimated fair value of revenue-based contingent consideration of $11 million. Based upon a preliminary acquisition valuation, the Company acquired $11 million of technology-based intangible assets with an estimated useful life of 13 years at the time of the acquisition, $2 million of IPR&D, and $5 million of goodwill.DiabeterOn March 26, 2015, the Company acquired Diabeter, an innovative Netherlands-based diabetes clinic and research center dedicated to providing comprehensive and individualized care for children and young adults with diabetes.

Corventis, Inc.On June 20, 2014, the Company acquired Corventis, Inc. (Corventis), a privately-held developer of wearable, wireless technologies for cardiac disease. Total consideration for the transaction was approximately $131 million, including a $50 million payment to Medtronic with respect to settlement of outstanding debt. Based upon the acquisition valuation, the Company acquired $80 million of technology-based intangible assets with an estimated useful life of 16 years at the time of acquisition and $48 million of goodwill.Patents and LicensesWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, and non-disclosure and non-competition agreements to establish and protect our proprietary technology. We have filed and obtained numerous patents in the U.S. and abroad, and regularly file patent applications worldwide in our continuing effort to establish and protect our proprietary technology. 7Table of ContentsU.S. patents typically have a 20-year term from the application date while patent protection outside the U.S. varies from country to country. In addition, we have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies. We have also obtained certain trademarks and tradenames for our products to distinguish our genuine products from our competitors’ products, and we maintain certain details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business as a whole. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property and avoid disputes over proprietary rights have included ongoing review of third-party patents and patent applications. For additional information see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.” and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Markets and Distribution MethodsWe sell most of our medical devices and therapies through direct sales representatives in the U.S. and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the U.S. For certain portions of our business acquired through the Covidien acquisition, we also sell through distributors in the U.S. Our medical supplies products are used primarily in hospitals, surgi-centers and alternate care facilities, such as home care and long-term care facilities, and are marketed to materials managers, GPOs and integrated delivery networks (IDNs) primarily through third-party distributors, although we also have direct sales representatives. We often negotiate with GPOs and IDNs, which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities. Our three largest markets are the U.S., Western Europe, and Japan. Emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity as we believe they remain under-penetrated.Our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid, cost-effective delivery of high-quality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide - including physicians, hospitals, other medical institutions, and GPOs. To achieve this objective, we organize our marketing and sales teams around physician specialties. This focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to cross-sell complementary products. We believe that we maintain excellent working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry that enable us to gain a detailed understanding of therapeutic and diagnostic developments, trends, and emerging opportunities and respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and patients. We attempt to enhance our presence in the medical community through active participation in medical meetings and by conducting comprehensive training and educational activities. We believe that these activities contribute to physician expertise.In keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in health care delivery, the current trend among hospitals and other customers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power. This enhanced purchasing power may lead to pressure on pricing and increased use of preferred vendors. Our customer base continues to evolve to reflect such economic changes across the geographic markets we serve. We are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales.Competition and IndustryWe compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in approximately 160 countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. Our product lines face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products. In addition, we face competition from providers of other medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies.Major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts, and publications about our products, reflecting the importance of product quality, product efficacy, and quality systems in the medical device industry. In addition, in the current environment of managed care, economically motivated customers, consolidation among health care providers, increased competition, and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes, and successfully market these products.8Table of ContentsWorldwide OperationsOur global operations are accompanied by certain financial and other risks. Relationships with customers and effective terms of sale vary by country; often with longer-term receivables than are typical in the U.S. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect revenues, net of expenses, and cash flows from operations outside the U.S. We use operational and economic hedges, as well as currency exchange rate derivative contracts, to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes on earnings and cash flow. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, the repatriation of earnings of certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. may result in substantial U.S. tax cost.For financial reporting purposes, net sales and property, plant, and equipment attributable to significant geographic areas are presented in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Production and Availability of Raw MaterialsWe manufacture most of our products at 80 manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world. The largest of these manufacturing facilities are located in Ireland, the U.S. (in thirteen states), Puerto Rico, Canada, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The People's Republic of China, Singapore, and Switzerland. We purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing these products from numerous suppliers in various countries. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability, or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Due to the U.S. FDA’s requirements regarding manufacturing of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components. However, a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our operations. We have reporting and disclosure requirements related to the use of certain minerals, known as "conflict minerals" (tantalum, tin, tungsten (or their ores), and gold) which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. Pursuant to these requirements, we are required to report on Form SD the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2014 calendar year, we were unable to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from all of our suppliers and were unable to determine that all of our products are conflict free. We may continue to face difficulties in gathering this information in the future. We may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement.Working Capital PracticesOur goal is to carry sufficient levels of inventory to ensure adequate supply of raw materials from suppliers and meet the product delivery needs of our customers. We also provide payment terms to customers in the normal course of business and rights to return product under warranty to meet the operational demands of our customers.EmployeesOn April 24, 2015, we employed more than 92,000 employees (including full-time equivalent employees). Our employees are vital to our success. We believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a highly competitive labor market due to our competitive compensation and benefits, and our rewarding work environment.SeasonalityWorldwide sales, including U.S. sales, do not reflect a significant degree of seasonality; however, the number of medical procedures incorporating Medtronic products is generally lower during summer months, due to summer vacation schedules in the northern hemisphere, particularly in European countries. In addition, pulse oximetry sales can be impacted by flu season.Government Regulation and Other ConsiderationsOur products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the U.S. FDA and similar agencies outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our products. Our business is also affected by U.S. and foreign 9Table of Contentspatient privacy laws, cost containment initiatives and environmental health and safety laws and regulations. The primary laws and regulations that affect our business are described below.The laws applicable to us are subject to change and are subject to evolving interpretations. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, Medtronic and its officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including substantial fines and damages, and exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid.Product Approval ProcessesAuthorization to commercially distribute a new medical device or technology in the U.S. is generally received in one of two ways. The first, known as pre-market notification or the 510(k) process, requires us to demonstrate that our new medical device or technology is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device or technology. In this process, we must submit data that supports our equivalence claim. If human clinical data is required, it must be gathered in compliance with U.S. FDA investigational device exemption regulations. We must receive an order from the U.S. FDA finding substantial equivalence to another legally marketed medical device or technology before we can commercially distribute the new medical device or technology. Modifications to cleared medical devices or technologies can be made without using the 510(k) process if the changes do not significantly affect safety or effectiveness. Covidien products are generally subject to the pre-market notification process. A very small number of our devices are exempt from pre-market review. The second, more rigorous process, known as pre-market approval (PMA), requires us to independently demonstrate that the new medical device is safe and effective. We do this by collecting data regarding design, materials, bench and animal testing, and human clinical data for the medical device. The U.S. FDA will authorize commercial distribution if it determines there is reasonable assurance that the medical device is safe and effective. This determination is based on the benefit outweighing the risk for the population intended to be treated with the device. This process is much more detailed, time-consuming, and expensive than the 510(k) process. A third, seldom used, process for approval exists for humanitarian use devices, intended for patient populations of less than 4,000 patients per year in the U.S. This exemption is similar to the PMA process; however, a full showing of product effectiveness from large clinical trials is not required. The threshold for approving these products is probable benefit and safety.Many countries outside the U.S. to which we export medical devices also subject such medical devices and technologies to their own regulatory requirements. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device or technology changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device or technology and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries. Because export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations are complex and constantly changing, we cannot assure you that laws and regulations may not be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our ability to sell or distribute products.In the European Union (EU), a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. A notified body assesses the quality management systems of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the essential and other requirements within the medical device directive. Medtronic is subject to inspection by notified bodies for compliance. The competent authorities of the EU countries, generally in the form of their ministries or departments of health, oversee the clinical research for medical devices and are responsible for market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. We are required to report device failures and injuries potentially related to product use to these authorities in a timely manner. Various penalties exist for non-compliance with the laws transcribing the medical device directives.To be sold in Japan, most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they are granted approval, or “shonin.” The Japanese government, through the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW), regulates medical devices under the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (PAL). Oversight for medical devices is conducted with participation by the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), a quasi-government organization performing many of the review functions for MHLW. Penalties for a company’s noncompliance with PAL could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company’s business license and criminal sanctions. MHLW and PMDA also assess the quality management systems of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the requirements of the PAL. Medtronic is subject to inspection for compliance by these agencies.Our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent, and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for 10Table of Contentsmedical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, on existing regulations. Certain regulators are requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products, or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future. There can be no assurance that any new medical devices we develop will be approved in a timely or cost-effective manner or approved at all.Ongoing U.S. FDA RegulationsBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under U.S. FDA regulations. The U.S. FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspection by the U.S. FDA for compliance with the U.S. FDA’s quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the U.S. FDA and other U.S. regulatory bodies (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and various state Attorneys General) monitor the manner in which we promote and advertise our products. Although surgeons are permitted to use their medical judgment to employ medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the U.S. FDA, we are prohibited from promoting products for such “off-label” uses, and can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban such medical devices. The U.S. FDA may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, including a hold on approving new devices until issues are resolved to its satisfaction, and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the DOJ. Conduct giving rise to civil or criminal penalties may also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payers or other persons allegedly harmed by our conduct.In April 2015 we entered into a consent decree with the FDA relating to our Neuromodulation business’ SynchroMed drug infusion system and the Neuromodulation quality system. The consent decree requires the Company to complete certain corrections and enhancements to the SynchroMed pump and the Neuromodulation quality system. The consent decree limits the Company's ability to manufacture and distribute the SynchroMed drug infusion system, unless specific conditions are met. The agreement does not require the retrieval of any of the Company’s products, but the Company must retain a third-party expert to inspect the Neuromodulation quality system and to provide a certification that the system complies with the requirements of the consent decree. Once this certification is provided to the FDA's satisfaction, the limitations on manufacturer and distribution of SynchroMed pumps will be lifted. Thereafter, the Company must submit periodic audit reports to the FDA to ensure ongoing compliance with the consent decree.Governmental Trade RegulationsThe sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subject us to extensive governmental trade regulations. A variety of laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and in the countries in which we transact business, apply to the sale, shipment and provision of goods, services and technology across international borders. Because we are subject to extensive regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are subject to the risk that laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, our import and export activities.The U.S. FDA, in cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), administers controls over the import of medical devices into the U.S. The CBP imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products, including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance. Medtronic is also subject to foreign trade controls administered by several U.S. government agencies, including the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Commerce Department and the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Treasury Department. We import raw materials, components and finished products into the countries in which we transact business. We act as the import of record in many instances, but we also sell and ship goods to third parties who are themselves responsible for complying with applicable trade laws and regulations. In our role as importer of record, we are directly responsible for complying with customs laws and regulations concerning the importation of our raw materials, components and finished products. If applicable government agencies were to determine that we or such third parties were not in compliance with applicable U.S. FDA or customs laws and regulations when engaging in cross-border transactions involving our products, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action, and varying degrees of liability, depending on the nature of the violation and 11Table of Contentsthe extent of our culpability. In addition, such determinations may cause supply chain disruptions and delays in the distribution of our products that impact our business activities.Many countries, including the U.S., control the export and re-export of goods, technology and services for reasons including public health, national security, regional stability, antiterrorism policies and other reasons. In certain circumstances, approval from governmental authorities may be required before goods, technology or services are exported or re-exported to certain destinations, to certain end-users and for certain end-uses. In addition, international sales of our medical devices that have not received U.S. FDA approval are subject to U.S. FDA export requirements. Some governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons or entities. In addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct export activities, we also sell and provide goods, technology and services to agents, representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and end-users. If applicable government agencies were to determine that we, or the third parties through which we export goods, were not in compliance with applicable export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations when engaging in transactions involving our products, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action, and varying degrees of liability, dependent upon the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability. Similarly, such determinations may cause disruption or delays in the distribution and sales of our products, or result in restrictions being placed upon our international distribution and sales of products which may materially impact our business activities.Anti-Boycott LawsUnder U.S. laws and regulations, U.S. companies and their controlled-in-fact foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities, including the sale, purchase, transfer, shipping or financing of goods or services within the U.S. or between the U.S. and a foreign country. Currently, the U.S. considers the Arab League boycott of Israel to constitute an unsanctioned foreign boycott. We are responsible for ensuring we comply with the requirements of U.S. anti-boycott laws for all transactions in which we are involved. If we, or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services, are determined to have violated U.S. anti-boycott laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action, and varying degrees of liability, dependent upon the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability. Penalties for any violations of anti-boycott laws and regulations could include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from government contracts, loss of export privileges and the denial of certain tax benefits, including foreign tax credits, and foreign subsidiary deferrals.Patient Privacy LawsU.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care providers. In particular, in April 2003, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published patient privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and, in April 2005, published security rules for protected health information. The HIPAA privacy and security rules govern the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information by “Covered Entities,” which are health care providers that submit electronic claims, health plans, and health care clearinghouses. In 2009, Congress passed the HITECH Act, which modified certain provisions of the HIPAA privacy and security rules for Covered Entities and their Business Associates (which is anyone that performs a service on behalf of a Covered Entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the Covered Entity’s workforce). These included directing HHS to publish more specific security standards, and increasing breach notification requirements, as well as tightening certain aspects of the privacy rules. HHS published the final versions of these new rules in January 2013, and Covered Entities and Business Associates were expected to be in compliance by September 2013. In addition, the HITECH Act provided that Business Associates will now be subject to the same security requirements as Covered Entities, and that with regard to both the security and privacy rule, Business Associates will be subject to direct enforcement by HHS, including civil and criminal liability, just as Covered Entities are. In the past, HIPAA has generally affected us indirectly. Medtronic is generally not a Covered Entity, except for a few units such as our Diabetes business, Medtronic Monitoring, Inc. and our health insurance plans. Medtronic only operates as a Business Associate to Covered Entities in a limited number of instances. In those cases, the patient data that we receive and analyze may include protected health information. We are committed to maintaining the security and privacy of patients’ health information and believe that we meet the expectations of the HIPAA rules. Some modifications to our systems and policies may be necessary, but the framework is already in place. However, the potential for enforcement action against us is now greater, as HHS can take action directly against Business Associates. Thus, while we believe we are and will be in substantial compliance with HIPAA standards, there is no guarantee that the government will agree. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. We believe the ongoing costs and impacts of assuring compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security rules are not material to our business. In addition, there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies. While Medtronic has not been named in any such suits, if a substantial breach or loss of data from our records were to occur, we could become a target of such litigation.We are also impacted by the privacy requirements of countries outside the United States. Privacy standards in Europe and Asia are becoming increasingly strict. Enforcement action and financial penalties related to privacy in the EU are growing, and new 12Table of Contentslaws and restrictions are being passed. The management of cross border transfers of information among and outside of EU member countries is becoming more complex, which may complicate our clinical research activities, as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of clinical data. China and Russia have passed so-called “data localization” laws, which require multi-national companies that store certain individually identifiable data on their citizens to maintain that data on servers located in their country. Restrictions on transfer or processing of that data may apply as well. These laws are new and the Chinese and Russian governments have not yet issued guidance on how they will apply or enforce them. The restrictions may complicate our operations in those countries, adding complexity and additional management and oversight needs. We will continue our efforts to comply with those requirements and to adapt our business processes to applicable laws.Cost Containment InitiativesGovernment and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the U.S. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance, and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, shifting to population health management, and other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs. Hospitals, which purchase implants, are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, including, for example, creating centralized purchasing functions that set pricing and in some cases limiting the number of vendors that can participate in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from the physicians’ collective change in practice patterns such as standardization of devices where medically appropriate. This has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for our products.Some third-party payers must also approve coverage and set reimbursement levels for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use the medical devices or therapies. Even though a new medical device may have been cleared for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement levels have been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers. In addition, some private third-party payers require that certain procedures or that the use of certain products be authorized in advance as a condition of reimbursement. International examples of cost containment initiatives and health care reforms in markets significant to Medtronic's business include Japan, where the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years, which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those procedures. As a result of our manufacturing efficiencies, cost controls and other cost-savings initiatives, we believe we are well-positioned to respond to changes resulting from the worldwide trend toward cost-containment; however, uncertainty remains as to the nature of any future legislation, new or changed coverage and reimbursement government or private payor policies or decisions, or other reforms, making it difficult for us to predict the potential impact of cost-containment trends on future operating results.Regulations Governing ReimbursementThe delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by HHS and comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care. Foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services.U.S. federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally-funded health care programs. The principal U.S. federal laws include: (1) the Anti-kickback Statute, which prohibits offers to pay or receive remuneration of any kind for the purpose of purchasing, ordering, recommending making referrals to items or services reimbursable by a federal health care program; (2) the False Claims Act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally-funded health care program, including claims resulting from a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute; (3) the Stark law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician (or a member of the physician’s immediate family) has a financial relationship with that provider; and (4) health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payer. There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self-referral and insurance laws that apply to state-funded Medicaid and other health care programs and private third-party payers. Insurance companies can also bring a private cause of action for treble damages against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims to be filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) can be used to prosecute companies in the U.S. for arrangements with physicians, or other parties outside the U.S. if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country.13Table of ContentsThe laws and regulations of health care goods and services that are applicable to us, including those described above, are subject to evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil financial penalties, including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare. Any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and health care goods and services could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and cash flows.Our profitability and operations are subject to risks relating to changes in U.S. and foreign legislative, regulatory and reimbursement policies and decisions as well as changes to private payer reimbursement coverage and payment decisions and policies. Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement system in the U.S. and abroad, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.Environmental Health and Safety LawsWe are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Like other companies in our industry, our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials. To the best of our knowledge at this time, we do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.Litigation RisksPatent Litigation We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products. At any given time, we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation incidents to our business, we believe the outcomes associated with this type of litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. For additional information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.” and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Product Liability and Other Claims   We operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims. These claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class. We are also susceptible to other litigation, including private securities litigation, shareholder derivative suits and contract litigation. These claims may be asserted against us in the future based on events we are not aware of at the present time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of product liability litigation, we believe the outcomes associated with this type of litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. For additional information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Quality problems with, and product liability claims in connection with, our processes, goods, and services, could lead to recalls or safety alerts, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows.” and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Self-InsuranceWith the exception of insurance that Covidien currently holds for certain risks, we have elected to self-insure most of our insurable risks. We made this decision based on conditions in the insurance marketplace that have led to increasingly higher levels of self-insurance retentions, increasing numbers of coverage limitations, and dramatically higher insurance premium rates. We maintain a directors and officers insurance policy providing limited coverage and we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value to us of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future. Based on historical loss trends, we believe that our self-insurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses. Historical trends, however, may not be indicative of future losses. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings, financial condition and/or cash flows.14Table of ContentsSection 13(r) of the Exchange ActUnder Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, the Company is required to include certain disclosures in its periodic reports if the Company or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during the period covered by the report. As part of its ongoing compliance program, the Company identified certain sales of medical devices made during fiscal year 2015 by one of its non-U.S. affiliated entities to parties in Iran that were not covered by a general license issued by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Controls ("OFAC"). Those sales, which were generally conducted through distributors, whose customers include public hospitals which may be owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the Iranian government, resulted in approximately $4 million in gross revenues and approximately $3 million in net profits (excluding selling, general, and administrative expenses and allocations) in fiscal year 2015. At the time of these sales, the Company believed, based on correspondence received from OFAC in response to a request to renew the specific licenses the Company had to cover these sales, that the sales were eligible for an OFAC general license. The Company subsequently obtained the specific licenses required for these continued sales. The Company has also submitted an initial notification of voluntary self-disclosure regarding this matter to OFAC.Executive Officers of MedtronicSet forth below are the names and ages of current Section 16(b) executive officers of Medtronic, as well as information regarding their positions with Medtronic, their periods of service in these capacities, and their business experiences.

Risk FactorsInvesting in us involves a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including, among others, those discussed below. Each of the following risks should be carefully considered. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our Company. However, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones related to our businesses and are not necessarily listed in the order of their importance. Additional risks and uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.Risks Relating to the CompanyWe operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively.We compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in approximately 160 countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. In the product lines in which we compete, we face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes, technologies, or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our products or proposed products less competitive. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies. Competitive factors include:•product reliability,•product performance,•product technology,•product quality,•breadth of product lines,•product services,•customer support,•price, and•reimbursement approval from health care insurance providers.We also face competition for marketing, distribution, and collaborative development agreements, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions, and for licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research, seek patient protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours. These 16Table of Contentscompanies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring necessary product technologies.Major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts, and publications about our products; reflecting the importance of product quality, product efficacy, and quality systems in our industry. In the current environment of managed care, consolidation among health care providers, increased competition, and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create, invest in, or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into our proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, and manufacture and successfully market our products. Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success in our industry.Reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for supply or other manufacturing difficulties, may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales.The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. We manufacture most of our products at numerous manufacturing facilities located throughout the world. We purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing these products from numerous suppliers in various countries. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components. However, for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, or availability, we procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. However, we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful. In addition, due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the U.S. FDA regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or cost-effective manner and to make our related product sales.Other problems in the manufacturing process, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, defective raw materials and environmental factors, could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues.In addition, several of our key products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility, with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of such facilities, we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at the previous levels or at all. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility, a third-party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing capacity is lost.Moreover, pursuant to the conflict minerals requirements promulgated by the SEC as a part of Dodd-Frank, we are required to report on the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, as well as the process we use to determine the source of such materials. We will incur expenses as we work with our suppliers to evaluate the source of any conflict minerals in our products, and compliance with these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of our raw materials.Our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater regulation in the future.Our medical devices and technologies and our business activities are subject to a complex regime of regulations and an aggressive enforcement environment, including by the U.S. FDA, DOJ, Health and Human Services-Office of the Inspector General, and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities and members of Congress have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry. In addition, certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with health care providers. As a result, we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to health care providers licensed by certain states and, starting with payments or other transfers of value made on or after August 1, 2013, to all U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals at the federal level. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business. In addition, we may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement policies, systems, and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, which may also impact our business. We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations.We are subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.Our medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous U.S. and foreign government agencies, including the U.S. FDA and comparable agencies outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations 17Table of Contentsgoverning the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products, and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. Even if we are able to obtain such approval or clearance, it may:•take a significant amount of time,•require the expenditure of substantial resources,•involve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance,•involve modifications, repairs, or replacements of our products, and•result in limitations on the proposed uses of our products.Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under U.S. FDA regulations. Many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the U.S. FDA to determine compliance with the U.S. FDA’s requirements, including primarily the quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on U.S. FDA’s Form-483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. Since 2009, the U.S. FDA has significantly increased its oversight of companies subject to its regulations, including medical device companies, by hiring new investigators and stepping up inspections of manufacturing facilities. The U.S. FDA has recently also significantly increased the number of warning letters issued to companies. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, refuse to grant pending pre-market approval applications or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the DOJ. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations.In addition, device manufacturers are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling. A number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for “off-label” uses, including actions alleging that federal health care program reimbursement of products promoted for “off-label” uses constitute false and fraudulent claims to the government. The failure to comply with “off-label” promotion restrictions can result in significant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, and/or other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government.Pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the SEC promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as "conflict minerals" (tantalum, tin, tungsten (or their ores), and gold) which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. Under the rules, we are now required to disclose the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As of the date of each of Medtronic Inc.’s and Covidien's conflict minerals report for the 2014 calendar year, each of Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien were unable to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from all of its respective suppliers and was unable to determine that all of its respective products are conflict free. In addition, we may continue to face difficulties in gathering this information in the future. We may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement.Foreign governmental regulations have become increasingly stringent and more common, and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by foreign governmental authorities in the future. Penalties for a company’s non-compliance with foreign governmental regulation could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company’s business license and criminal sanctions. Any domestic or foreign governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities, violations and litigation.We are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the environment, investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites, chemical constituents 18Table of Contentsin medical equipment and end-of-life disposal and take-back programs, and the health and safety of our employees. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under such laws and regulations, primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes. If we violate these environmental laws and regulations, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Furthermore, environmental laws outside of the U.S. are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens.In addition, certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigative, removal and remedial costs under certain U.S. federal and state laws are retroactive, strict and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict, given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.We may in the future be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup based on our, Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien’s past, present or future business activities. The costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, or liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, may exceed our estimates, or have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flow.Our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of health care goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, business, financial condition and cash flows.Our devices, products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable foreign programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. As a result, our devices, products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by HHS, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services. The principal U.S. federal laws implicated include those that prohibit (i) the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment, known as the false claims laws, (ii) unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally-funded health care programs, known as the anti-kickback laws, and (iii) health care service providers from seeking reimbursement for providing certain services to a patient who was referred by a physician who has certain types of direct or indirect financial relationships with the service provider, known as the Stark law. Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payors. Insurance companies can also bring a private cause of action for treble damages against a manufacturer for causing a false claim to be filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, RICO. Our profitability and international operations are subject to risks relating to changes in U.S. and foreign medical government and private reimbursement programs and policies and changes in U.S. and foreign legal regulatory requirements. Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement system in the U.S. and abroad, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.The laws and regulations of health care goods and services that are applicable to us, including those described above, are subject to evolving interpretations. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties, including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by CMS. Any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and health care goods and services could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and cash flows.19Table of ContentsWe are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, and non-disclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation against us can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products. At any given time, we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation, we believe the results associated with any such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others, which would generally have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows.While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, our patents, trade secrets, or other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Further, pending patent applications owned by us may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We also rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with certain employees, consultants, and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.In addition, the laws of certain countries in which we market some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Quality problems with, and product liability claims in connection with, our processes, goods, and services, could lead to recalls or safety alerts, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows.Quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure and our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices. In addition, many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. Component failures, manufacturing defects, design flaws, off-label use, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information with respect to our products could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient. These problems could lead to recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products, and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions, which could ultimately result, in certain cases, in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith. Due to the strong name recognition of the Medtronic and Covidien brands, a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand, and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future.In addition, our quality certifications are critical to the marketing success of our goods and services. If we fail to meet these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers, and our revenue and results of operations could decline. Our success also depends generally on our ability to manufacture to exact tolerances precision-engineered components, subassemblies, and finished devices from multiple materials. If our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation, competitive advantage and market share could be harmed. In certain situations, we also may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data.Further, we have elected to self-insure with respect to product liability risks and any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could be costly to defend. See "Our self-insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses." Any of the foregoing problems, including product liability claims or product recalls in the future, regardless of their ultimate 20Table of Contentsoutcome, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.Health care policy changes, including U.S. health care reform legislation, signed in 2010, may have a material adverse effect on us.In response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators, and third-party payers to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. health care system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010. Certain provisions of the law will not be effective for a number of years and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood, and it is unclear what the full impacts will be from the law. The legislation imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a 2.3 percent excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales that commenced in January 2013. Under the legislation, the total cost to the medical device industry is expected to be approximately $20 billion over 10 years. The law also focuses on a number of Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs. It is uncertain at this point what negative unintended consequences these provisions will have on patient access to new technologies. The Medicare provisions include value-based payment programs, increased funding of comparative effectiveness research, reduced hospital payments for avoidable readmissions and hospital acquired conditions, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies that promote care coordination (such as bundled physician and hospital payments). Additionally, the law includes a reduction in the annual rate of inflation for Medicare payments to hospitals that began in 2011 and the establishment of an independent payment advisory board to recommend ways of reducing the rate of growth in Medicare spending. We cannot predict what health care programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation. However, any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Our self-insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses.We have elected to self-insure most of our insurable risks. We made this decision based on conditions in the insurance marketplace that have led to increasingly higher levels of self-insurance retentions, increasing numbers of coverage limitations, and dramatically higher insurance premium rates. We maintain a directors and officers policy providing limited coverage and continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value to us of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future. While based on historical loss trends we believe that our self-insurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses, we cannot guarantee that this will remain true. Historical trends may not be indicative of future losses. The fact that we do not maintain third-party insurance coverage for all categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows.If we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses, our results of operations will suffer.We may experience decreasing prices for our goods and services due to pricing pressure experienced by our customers from managed care organizations and other third-party payers, increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates, and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers. If the prices for our goods and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses, our results of operations will be adversely affected.We may experience higher costs to produce our products as a result of changes in prices for oil, gas and other commodities.We use resins, other petroleum-based materials and pulp as raw materials in some of our products. Prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities. Oil, gas and pulp prices are volatile and may increase, resulting in higher costs to produce and distribute our products. New laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of certain raw materials and components. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost-containment efforts of our customers and third-party payers, we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover these costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.21Table of ContentsContinuing worldwide economic instability could adversely affect our revenues, financial condition or results of operations.Since fiscal year 2008, the global economy has been impacted by the sequential effects of an ongoing global financial crisis. This global financial crisis continues to cause disruption in the financial markets, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, during certain periods. There can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy. Our customers and vendors may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our products or to pay for our products on a timely basis, if at all. As with our customers and vendors, these economic conditions make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. In addition, a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national health care systems in many countries. Repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the financial stability of the economies of those countries.In light of these global economic fluctuations, we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers located outside the U.S. Failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to a variety of market and financial risks due to our international operations that could adversely affect those operations or our profitability and operating results.Operations in countries outside of the U.S., accounting for approximately 44 percent of our net sales for the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015, are accompanied by certain financial and other risks. We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales outside the U.S., especially in emerging markets, which could expose us to greater risks associated with international sales and operations. Our profitability and international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,•healthcare reform legislation,•multiple non-U.S. regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products,•local product preferences and product requirements,•longer-term receivables than are typical in the U.S.,•trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements,•less intellectual property protection in some countries outside the U.S. than exists in the U.S.,•different labor regulations and workforce instability,•political and economic instability,•the potential payment of U.S. income taxes on earnings of certain controlled foreign subsidiaries subject to U.S. taxation upon repatriation,•the expiration and non-renewal of foreign tax rulings and/or grants,•potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws, and•economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations.In particular, the Obama administration has announced potential legislative proposals to tax profits of U.S. companies earned abroad. While it is impossible for us to predict whether these and other proposals will be implemented, or how they will ultimately impact us, they may materially impact our results of operations if, for example, our profits earned abroad are subject to U.S. income tax, or we are otherwise disallowed deductions as a result of these profits.Finally, changes in foreign currency exchange rates may reduce the reported value of our foreign currency revenues, net of expenses, and cash flows. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates, the impact of exchange rate changes, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes.The failure to comply with U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdiction could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, most of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such anti-bribery laws.Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by U.S. and foreign governmental agencies, and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. Our international operations create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors, because these parties are not always subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on 22Table of Contentsthese legal requirements and discourage improper practices. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by any companies in which we invest or that we acquire. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, including exclusion from government contracting, and could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.Laws and regulations governing the export of our products could adversely impact our business.The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce (BIS), administer certain laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Due to our international operations, we are subject to such laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals, and are constantly changing. Further restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations.From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions, including Iran, Sudan, Syria, Cuba and those in the region of Crimea. Certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices and surgical tools, and may provide related services, to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries. These business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income, but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. Violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.Many health care industry companies, including health care systems, are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power. As the health care industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices that incorporate components produced by us. If we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry, our revenues would decrease and our consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows would suffer.Our business is indirectly subject to health care industry cost-containment measures that could result in reduced sales of medical devices and medical devices containing our components.Most of our customers, and the health care providers to whom our customers supply medical devices, rely on third-party payers, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities, insurance companies, and other payers of health care costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payers. If third-party payer payment approval cannot be obtained by patients, sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components. The cost-containment measures that health care providers are instituting, both in the U.S. and internationally, could harm our ability to operate profitably. For example, managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals.In an effort to reduce costs, many existing and potential customers for our products within the U.S. have become members of group purchase organizations (GPOs) and integrated delivery networks (IDNs). GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangement with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. GPOs and IDNs typically award contracts on a category-by-category basis through a competitive bidding process. Bids are generally solicited from multiple manufacturers with the intention of driving down pricing. Due to the highly competitive nature of the GPO and IDN contracting processes, we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract positions with major GPOs and IDNs across our product portfolio. Furthermore, the increasing leverage of organized buying groups may reduce market prices for our products, thereby reducing our profitability.While having a contract with a GPO and IDN for a given product category can facilitate sales to members of that GPO or IDN, such contract positions can offer no assurance that sales volumes of those products will be maintained. GPOs and IDNs increasingly are awarding contracts to multiple suppliers for the same product category. Even when we are the sole contracted supplier of a 23Table of ContentsGPO or IDN for a certain product category, members of the GPO or IDN generally are free to purchase from other suppliers. Furthermore, GPO and IDN contracts typically are terminable without cause upon 60 to 90 days’ notice. Accordingly, although we have multiple contracts with many major GPOs and IDNs, the members of such groups may choose to purchase from our competitors due to the price or quality offered by such competitors, which could result in a decline in our sales and profitability.Our research and development efforts rely upon investments and investment collaborations, and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful.Our strategy to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller, healthier lives requires a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions. In addition to internally generated growth through our research and development efforts, historically we have relied, and expect to continue to rely, upon investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas.We expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses. Investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows.The continuing development of many of our products depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with health care professionals.If we fail to maintain our working relationships with health care professionals, many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products, which could cause a decline in our earnings and profitability. The research, development, marketing, and sales of many of our new and improved products is dependent upon our maintaining working relationships with health care professionals. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development, marketing, and sale of our products. Physicians assist us as researchers, marketing and product consultants, inventors, and public speakers. If we are unable to maintain our strong relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows.We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business and if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or if our products do not operate as intended or we experience a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems, our business could be materially affected.We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure. We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-today operations. The size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, and changing customer patterns. As a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities.In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products or systems and may obtain data relating to patients with our products or the Company’s proprietary information. If we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences. There can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption, or destruction of these systems, as well as any data breaches, could have a material adverse effect on our business.24Table of ContentsNegative conditions in the global credit market may impair our commercial paper program, our auction rate securities, and our other fixed income securities, which may cause us losses and liquidity issues.We have investments in marketable debt securities that are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Our debt securities include U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, debt funds, and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, including auction rate securities. Market conditions over the past several years have included periods of significant economic uncertainty and at times general market distress, especially in the banking and financial services sector. During these periods of economic uncertainty, we may experience reduced liquidity across the fixed-income investment market, including the securities in which we invest. In the event we need to sell these securities, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner or for a value that is equal to the underlying principal. In addition, we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the securities and record an impairment charge. If we determine that the fair value of such securities is temporarily impaired, we would record a temporary impairment as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders’ equity. If it is determined that the fair value of these securities is other-than-temporarily impaired, we would record a loss in our consolidated statements of earnings, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.Negative market conditions may also impair our ability to access the capital markets through the issuance of commercial paper or debt securities, or may impact our ability to sell such securities at a reasonable price and may negatively impact our ability to borrow from financial institutions.Our products are continually the subject of clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors, or other third parties, the results of which may be unfavorable, or perceived as unfavorable, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations, and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors, or by third parties, or the market’s or U.S. FDA’s perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business.As part of our strategy to develop and identify new products and technologies, we have made several acquisitions in recent years, including the recent acquisition of Covidien, and may make additional acquisitions in the future. Our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, manufacturing, and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management’s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects. Our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of the combined company successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so. Factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include:•the presence or absence of adequate internal controls and/or significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies,•adverse developments arising out of investigations by governmental entities of the business practices of acquired companies, including potential liability imposed by FCPA,•any decrease in customer loyalty and product orders caused by dissatisfaction with the combined companies’ product lines and sales and marketing practices, including price increases,•our ability to retain key employees, and•the ability of the combined company to achieve synergies among its constituent companies, such as increasing sales of the combined company’s products, achieving cost savings, and effectively combining technologies to develop new products.We also could experience negative effects on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges. These effects, individually or in the aggregate, could cause a deterioration of our credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.25Table of ContentsThe medical device industry is the subject of numerous governmental investigations into marketing and other business practices. These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and/or criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties, and/or administrative remedies, divert the attention of our management, and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. FDA and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry. We occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from state and federal governmental agencies, including, among others, the U.S. DOJ and the Office of Inspector General of HHS. These investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with health care providers, regulatory compliance, and product promotional practices. We cooperate with these investigations and respond to such requests. However, when an investigation begins, we cannot predict when it will be resolved, the outcome of the investigation, or its impact on us. An adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil and/or criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties, and/or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs, entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) with governmental agencies and amendments to existing CIAs. In addition, resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations. Finally, if these investigations continue over a long period of time, they could divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operations of our business and impose significant administrative burdens, including cost, on us. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from these investigations or other investigations initiated by the government at any time, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business.As of April 24, 2015, our total consolidated external debt was approximately $36.2 billion. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions, and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged;•limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;•limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and•exposing us to greater interest rate risk.Our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal in indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures, which could impede our growth. Our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness, and to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various jurisdictions outside the U.S. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings and financial condition. Additionally, changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. For example, legislation in 2010 imposed a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers for U.S. sales of medical devices beginning in January 2013. Proposals for fundamental U.S. corporate tax reform, if enacted, could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Medtronic, Inc. tax court proceeding outcome could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.In March 2009, the IRS issued its audit report for Medtronic Inc.'s fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreements with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. On December 23, 2010, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency with respect to the remaining issues. Medtronic, Inc. filed a Petition with the U.S. Tax Court on March 21, 2011 objecting to the deficiency. During October and November 2012, Medtronic, Inc. reached a resolution with the IRS on various matters, including the deductibility of a settlement payment. Medtronic, Inc. and the IRS agreed to hold one issue, the calculation of amounts eligible for the one-time repatriation holiday, because such issue was being addressed by other taxpayers in litigation 26Table of Contentswith the IRS. The remaining unresolved issue relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of the Company's key manufacturing sites. The Tax Court proceeding with respect to this issue began on February 3, 2015 and ended on March 12, 2015. The Company expects a ruling from the Tax Court during fiscal year 2017.Examination and audits by tax authorities, and Covidien’s tax sharing agreement with Tyco International plc and TE Connectivity Ltd., could result in additional tax payments, which could have a material adverse effect on our and Covidien’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.On June 29, 2007, Covidien entered into a tax sharing agreement with Tyco International plc (Tyco International) and TE Connectivity Ltd. (TE Connectivity) pursuant to which Covidien, Tyco International and TE Connectivity agreed to share 42%, 27% and 31%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Covidien’s, Tyco International’s and TE Connectivity’s U.S. income tax returns, certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments, and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of Covidien’s 2007 separation from Tyco International (2007 separation). Under the tax sharing agreement, Tyco International currently has the right to administer, control and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. The timing, nature and amount of any settlement agreed to by Tyco International may not be in our or Covidien’s best interests. The other parties to the tax sharing agreement can remove Tyco International as the controlling party only under limited circumstances, including a change of control or bankruptcy of Tyco International, or by a majority vote of the parties.In connection with the 2007 separation, all tax liabilities associated with Covidien’s business became Covidien’s tax liabilities. Following Covidien’s spin-off of its Pharmaceuticals business to Covidien shareholders through a distribution of all the outstanding ordinary shares of Mallinkrodt (2013 separation), Mallinckrodt became the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for the tax liabilities attributable to its subsidiaries, a significant portion of which relate to periods prior to the 2007 separation. However, Covidien remains the sole party subject to the tax sharing agreement with Tyco International and TE Connectivity. Accordingly, Mallinckrodt does not share in Covidien’s liability to Tyco International and TE Connectivity, nor in the receivable that Covidien has from Tyco International and TE Connectivity. Although Covidien shares certain tax liabilities with Tyco International and TE Connectivity pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, if Tyco International and TE Connectivity default on their obligations to Covidien under the tax sharing agreement, Covidien would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.Further, if any party to the tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party’s fault, each non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, Covidien could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and be required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, Covidien may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the agreed upon share of Covidien’s, Tyco International’s and TE Connectivity’s tax liabilities.On September 28, 2012, Tyco International spun-off two of its businesses to its shareholders, with Tyco International remaining as a publicly-traded company. This could have a material adverse impact on Tyco International’s ability to fulfill its obligations to us under the tax sharing agreement.In addition, the IRS has concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International’s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and proposed tax adjustments, several of which also affect Covidien’s income tax returns for years after 2000. Tyco International has appealed certain of the tax adjustments proposed by the IRS and has resolved all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments. With respect to the outstanding issue that remains in dispute, on June 20, 2013, Tyco International advised Covidien that it had received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS asserting that several of Tyco International’s former U.S. subsidiaries owe additional taxes of $914 million plus penalties of $154 million based on audits of the 1997 through 2000 tax years of Tyco International and its subsidiaries as they existed at that time. These amounts exclude interest and do not reflect the impact on subsequent periods if the position taken by the IRS is ultimately proved correct. The IRS has asserted in the Notices of Deficiency that substantially all of Tyco International’s intercompany debt originating during the years 1997 through 2000 should not be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and has disallowed interest deductions related to the intercompany debt and certain tax attribute adjustments recognized on Tyco International’s U.S. income tax returns totaling approximately $3.0 billion. On July 22, 2013, Tyco International filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the IRS assessment. The outcome of any such litigation is uncertain and could result in a significant increase in liability for taxes arising during these periods. In particular, if the IRS is successful in asserting its claim, it would likely assert that approximately $6.6 billion of interest deductions with respect to Tyco International’s intercompany debt in subsequent time periods should also be disallowed.The Company has provided reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. However, the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, 27Table of Contentsany dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is significantly different from current estimates. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which it is ultimately liable, we would incur additional charges to expense and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.If the distribution of Mallinckrodt ordinary shares to Covidien shareholders in 2013, the distribution of Covidien and TE Connectivity common shares by Tyco International to its shareholders in 2007 or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of either the 2013 or the 2007 separation are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and Covidien could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.Covidien received an IRS ruling substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) certain transactions effected in connection with its 2013 separation of Mallinckrodt qualify as transactions under Sections 355 and/or 368(a) of the Code, and (ii) the distribution qualifies as a transaction under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In addition to obtaining the IRS ruling, Covidien received a tax opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, in form and substance acceptable to Covidien, which relied on the effectiveness of the IRS ruling, substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the distribution and certain transactions entered into in connection with the distribution qualify as transactions under Sections 355 and/or 368(a) of the Code.Tyco International has received private letter rulings from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the distribution of Covidien and TE Connectivity common shares by Tyco International to its shareholders, substantially to the effect that the distribution, except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share, of Covidien shares and the TE Connectivity common shares, qualifies as tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation from Tyco International qualify for favorable treatment under the Code. In addition to obtaining the private letter rulings, Tyco International obtained tax opinions from the law firm of McDermott Will & Emery LLP confirming the tax-free status of the distribution and certain internal transactions.The private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings (a) in the case of the 2013 separation, from Covidien and Mallinckrodt, and (b) in the case of the 2007 separation, from Covidien, TE Connectivity and Tyco International, regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the tax opinions, the IRS could determine on audit that the 2013 distribution or the 2007 distribution or the related internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of the respective facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distributions, or if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinions that are not covered by the IRS rulings.We could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities or tax indemnification obligations, whether under applicable law or the tax matters agreement that was entered into with Mallinckrodt, if it is ultimately determined that certain related transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2013 distribution are taxable. We could also incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately is determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of Covidien’s separation from Tyco International should be treated as taxable transactions.Our tax position may be adversely affected by changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations.Recent legislative proposals have aimed to expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence, limit the ability of foreign-owned corporations to deduct interest expense, tax the accumulated unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations, impose a minimum tax on the future offshore earnings of U.S. multinational groups, and to make other changes in the taxation of multinational corporations.Additionally, the U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S., Ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business.Moreover, U.S. and foreign tax authorities may carefully scrutinize companies that result from a cross-border business combination (such as us), which may lead such authorities to assert that we owe additional taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.28Table of ContentsRisks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of IncorporationIrish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Acts, which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S.A transfer of our shares, other than ones effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company, may be subject to Irish stamp duty.Transfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the Depository Trust Company (DTC) will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. However, if you hold our shares directly rather than beneficially through DTC, any transfer of your shares could be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired). Payment of Irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee. The potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of your shares.In certain limited circumstances, dividends we pay may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by Irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax.In certain limited circumstances, dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 20%) may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares. A number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the U.S. and other specified countries may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax.Shareholders resident in the U.S. that hold their shares through DTC will not be subject to dividend withholding tax, provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the U.S. (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us). However, other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of their shares.Shareholders entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to Irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with Ireland other than their shareholding in our Company (for example, they are resident in Ireland). Shareholders who receive dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on those dividends.Our shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to Irish capital acquisitions tax.Irish capital acquisitions tax (CAT) could apply to a gift or inheritance of our shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties. This is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in Ireland. The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT. Children have a tax-free threshold of €225,000 in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents.Risks Relating to the Covidien Acquisition (the Transactions)We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Transactions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien.Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented 29Table of Contentsineffectively or if impacted by unforeseen negative economic or market conditions or other factors, we may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the transaction. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations.In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management’s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:•the diversion of management’s attention to integration matters;•difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the businesses;•difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;•difficulties in the assimilation of employees;•difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company; •challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; and •challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel.Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses of Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Furthermore, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien. All of these factors could negatively impact our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction, and negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares. As a result, we cannot assure you that the combination of the Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction.Future potential changes to the U.S. tax laws could result in us being treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and the IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S federal income tax purposes.Because we are an Irish incorporated entity, we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Even so, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).Under Section 7874 of the Code, if Medtronic Inc.’s shareholders immediately prior to the Transaction hold 80% or more of the vote or value of our shares by reason of holding stock in Medtronic, Inc. immediately after the Transaction (the ownership test), and our expanded affiliated group after the Transaction does not have substantial business activities in Ireland relative to its worldwide activities (the substantial business activities test), we would be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Based on the rules for determining share ownership under Section 7874 of the Code, Medtronic, Inc.’s shareholders received approximately 70% of our ordinary shares (by both vote and value) by reason of holding stock in Medtronic, Inc. Therefore, under current law, we should not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, there is limited guidance regarding the application of Section 7874, including the application of the ownership test.In addition, changes to Section 7874 or the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder could affect our status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. Any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application.Since Section 7874 was enacted, there have been various legislative proposals to broaden its scope. Such proposals could, among other things, treat a foreign acquiring corporation as a U.S. corporation under Section 7874 if the former shareholders of the U.S. corporation own more than 50% of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the transaction, or if the foreign corporation’s affiliated group has substantial business activities in the U.S. and the foreign corporation is primarily managed and controlled in the U.S. Accordingly, if enacted in their present form and retroactively effective to apply to the Transactions, such proposals could cause us to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.If we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for federal tax purposes, based on our existing expected cash flows, we could be subject to substantially greater U.S. tax liability than currently contemplated as a non-U.S. corporation.Specifically, if we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for federal tax purposes, we would be subject to U.S. corporate income tax on our worldwide income, and the income of our foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. tax when repatriated or when deemed recognized under the U.S. tax rules for controlled foreign corporations (CFC's). Additionally, Covidien's foreign 30Table of Contentscorporations, which are not currently CFC's, would become CFC's making them potentially subject to current or future U.S. taxation, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS may promulgate rules that would adversely affect our tax position.The U.S. Treasury Department has announced that it is examining possible changes in the regulatory rules affecting companies that move their tax domicile outside the U.S. In the event the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS were to change the applicable regulatory rules, we could face potentially substantial tax costs as a result of the Transactions. We are unable to assess the potential impact of any such possible changes, if adopted, until they are announced.On September 22, 2014, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS issued new guidance announcing their intention to issue regulations interpreting multiple sections of the Code, including Section 7874, to address inversion transactions and transactions that Treasury and the IRS characterize as “post-inversion tax avoidance transactions” (the IRS Notice). When issued, such regulations would apply to transactions completed on or after September 22, 2014. The regulations described in the IRS Notice would expand the set of circumstances under which Section 7874 applies to cause the foreign acquirer of a U.S. corporation to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such regulations would also impose additional U.S. taxes on certain transactions involving the acquired U.S. corporation’s CFC’s.The regulations interpreting Section 7874 of the Code announced in the IRS Notice are not expected to cause us to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. However, if ultimately upheld by a reviewing court, the regulations announced in the IRS Notice would be expected to limit our ability to engage in various intercompany transactions involving non-U.S. subsidiaries.In addition, in the IRS Notice, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS announced their intention to issue additional guidance in the future intended to restrict our ability to undertake certain transactions which could reduce our U.S. tax liability. According to the IRS Notice, such guidance may include, among other things, limitations on our ability to deduct interest on certain intercompany debt for U.S federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict the likelihood that any such guidance will be issued, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated thereunder or the effect such guidance may have on our business.The Transaction may not allow us to maintain competitive global cash management and a low effective corporate tax rate.While we believe that being incorporated in Ireland should help us maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate and provide flexible global cash management, we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be, however, because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we will operate. Additionally, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate.Legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of U.S. federal or state governmental contracts to U.S. companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business.Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us. We are unable to predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business.Item 1B.
