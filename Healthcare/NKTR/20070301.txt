Item 1A. Risk Factors    We are providing the following cautionary discussion of risk factors, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions that we believe are relevant to our business. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and our forward-looking statements. We note these factors for investors as permitted by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider this section to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may substantially impact our business.    Our revenue and results of operations depend on sales to Pfizer.    We currently depend on Pfizer as the source of a significant portion of our revenues. Revenue from Pfizer represented 64% and 64% of our total revenue for the years ending December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. We expect a significant portion of our future revenue from Pfizer will come from the commercial manufacture and sale of Exubera Inhalation Powder to Pfizer, the sale of Exubera Inhalers and component parts to Pfizer, and royalties from Exubera product sales by Pfizer. Under our collaboration agreement with Pfizer, the Exubera royalties depend on the level of Exubera sales and Pfizer’s cost of goods sold for the product. The commercial launch of Exubera is in the early stages and it is difficult to predict future Exubera sales levels and the royalties we will receive from those sales.    The Exubera commercial launch is in the early stages and there can be no assurance regarding the commercial success of Exubera.    Pfizer has taken a phased approach to the Exubera commercial launch. In the second half of 2006, the first phase of the Exubera launch focused on manufacturing scale-up activities and the education of diabetes specialists. In 2007, Pfizer initiated the next phase of the launch expanding the education, marketing and sales efforts more broadly to primary care physicians. We do not participate in any way in the sales and marketing of Exubera and therefore have no direct control over the commercial success of Exubera. There can be no assurance regarding the commercial success of Exubera which will depend on such factors as Pfizer’s investment in the marketing and sales of Exubera, physician and patient education and experiences, third party payor reimbursement, country specific pricing approvals, size of the market for inhaled insulin, successful product manufacturing and the impact of competition from other diabetes therapies. If sales of Exubera are not successful or delayed, it would have a material impact on our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.    If we are not able to manufacture and supply sufficient quantities of Exubera Inhalation Powder to meet market demand it would negatively impact our revenue and results of operations.    We have performed insulin powder processing on the scale needed for commercial production of Exubera Inhalation Powder for approximately one year. Although we have been substantially successful at meeting our Exubera Inhalation Powder manufacturing objectives to date, we could encounter manufacturing and quality control problems as we continue to manufacture large commercial quantities. If market demand requires, we may not be able to expand commercial production of Exubera Inhalation Powder in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost. Increasing manufacturing capacity requires significant capital investments and substantial periods of time to implement and obtain regulatory qualifications. As a result of the long-lead time required to add manufacturing capacity, increases in demand for Exubera could result in our inability to meet market demand.    We are required to maintain compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and are subject to inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. We anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of our powder drug manufacturing facilities for compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. The results of these inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes,     23    Table of Contents  facility or capital equipment upgrades, or suspension of manufacturing until the FDA is satisfied that the manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with cGMP. Manufacturing delays for Exubera Inhalation Powder pending resolution of regulatory deficiencies or suspensions would have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations.    We depend on two contract manufacturers to manufacture the Exubera Inhalers and the failure to manufacture sufficient quantities of the Exubera Inhalers to meet market demand would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    We depend on two contract manufacturers and their supply chains to manufacture and supply the Exubera Inhalers. Because the manufacturing process for the Exubera Inhaler is complex and subject to extensive government regulations, alternative qualified contract manufacturers or increased capacity may not be available on a timely basis, at a commercially reasonable cost or at all. Increasing manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers involves significant risks and uncertainties including significant lead time requirements, large capital investments, the recruitment and training of additional qualified personnel, and other operational complexities. Although our contract manufacturers have been successful at meeting the commercial manufacturing objectives for Exubera Inhalers to date, there can be no assurance that in future periods our contract manufacturers may not experience manufacturing or quality control problems or that they will be able to continue to scale-up manufacturing to meet commercial demand for the Exubera Inhaler devices.    We also depend on the suppliers of our contract manufacturers to provide a large number of component parts for the Exubera Inhaler in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis to meet market demand. A failure by one or more of these suppliers to provide sufficient parts or components in accordance with our specifications on a timely basis to meet market demand would limit our Exubera Inhaler production capacity and would have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations.    In addition, we anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of our contract manufacturers’ facilities. Although our contract manufacturers have obligations to comply with regulatory requirements, the results of these regulatory inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes, facility or capital equipment upgrades or expansion, or suspension of manufacturing until the FDA is satisfied that the manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with cGMP. Manufacturing delays pending resolution of regulatory deficiencies or suspensions would have a severe negative impact on our revenue, results of operations, and financial position.    If Pfizer is unable to manufacture and deliver bulk insulin for powder processing, fill the insulin powder into blister packs for the Exubera Inhaler, or package sufficient quantities of the Exubera product to meet market demand, it would significantly and negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    Pfizer is responsible for providing the bulk insulin for powder processing, automated filling of all the powder insulin blister packs, and all packaging required for the final Exubera product. Pfizer may encounter manufacturing, filling or packaging problems that cannot be remedied in a timely manner to meet commercial demand for the Exubera product. In addition, Pfizer also has the right to manufacture up to one-half of the Exubera Inhalation Powder. In the second half of 2006, Pfizer experienced manufacturing scale-up challenges due to the complex Exubera manufacturing process designed by Pfizer which requires highly automated, specially engineered equipment. Any failure, delay or inability to address these challenges and scale-up Pfizer’s portion of the manufacturing, filling and packaging processes could impede Exubera sales and would significantly and negatively impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.    We also anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of Pfizer manufacturing, filling and packaging facilities for regulatory compliance. Findings from these regulatory inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes, facility or capital equipment upgrades or suspension of Pfizer’s manufacturing activities until the FDA is satisfied that the manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with cGMP.     24    Table of Contents  Manufacturing delays pending resolution of deficiencies or suspension would have a negative impact on our revenue, results of operations, regulatory approvals, and public confidence in the Exubera product.    The discovery of any new or more severe side effects or negative efficacy findings for Exubera could significantly harm our business.    While the safety of Exubera for patients has been extensively studied in clinical trials with generally mild to moderate side-effects to date, Pfizer is conducting controlled long-term safety and efficacy studies of Exubera. Exubera is known to have certain side effects such as a small decrease in lung function generally within the first months of treatment, lowered blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) and a mild cough within seconds to minutes after taking Exubera. There can be no assurance that additional or more severe side effects or negative efficacy findings may not be discovered based on Pfizer’s long-term safety and efficacy studies or required reporting of adverse events regarding Exubera, any of which could severely harm our business and result in one or more of the following regulatory events:        •    a voluntary or involuntary recall or market withdrawal of Exubera;        •    labeling changes such as restriction on intended uses, additional contraindications, warnings, precautions, or adverse reactions that would limit Exubera market potential;        •    a ‘boxed’ warning in the label;        •    imposition of post-marketing surveillance studies or risk management programs;        •    distribution restrictions; and        •    adverse publicity.    In addition, one or more of the above factors would also have the potential to negatively impact regulatory registrations for Exubera in other countries.    If we are not successful in developing the next generation Exubera pulmonary inhaler device it could negatively impact our revenue and results of operations.    We currently are working on the development of a next generation Exubera Inhaler device which we believe will be important to maintaining a long term competitive advantage for Exubera. The objective of these development efforts is to improve the device portability, convenience, reliability and ease of use. There are significant risks associated with this program including developing the formulation for the next generation device, design engineering challenges, design for manufacturability and cost effectiveness and regulatory considerations. The next-generation Exubera Inhaler will require regulatory approval which could be a very costly and time consuming process with substantial risk. Competitors with products under development could successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval, and commercialize a more convenient, easy to use, smaller pulmonary insulin inhaler device for insulin which could negatively impact market share for Exubera. If we are not successful in developing a next generation Exubera Inhaler on a timely basis or at all, it could result in loss of market share for Exubera which would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.    The manufacture, testing, marketing and sale of medical products involves an inherent risk of product liability. If product liability costs exceed our product liability insurance coverage, we may incur substantial liabilities that could have a severe negative impact on our financial position. Whether or not we were ultimately successful in product liability litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, and might result in adverse publicity, all of which would impair our business. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain our clinical trial insurance or product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all, and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims or losses.    25    Table of Contents If we fail to establish future successful collaborative relationships, then our results of operation and financial condition may be adversely impacted.    We intend to seek future collaborative relationships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to fund some of our research and development expenses and develop and commercialize product candidates. We are currently seeking partners for two of our proprietary product candidates and the success, timing and terms and conditions of these partnering efforts will affect our revenues and financial results in 2007 and beyond. If we are ultimately not able to negotiate acceptable collaborative arrangements with respect to our existing and future product candidates, or if any arrangements we do negotiate do not include sufficiently favorable commercial terms, we may not receive an adequate return on these investments and our results of operations and financial condition would suffer.    If the collaborative partners we depend on to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our partner products are not successful, or if such collaborations fail, then the product development or commercialization of our partner products may be delayed or unsuccessful.    When we sign a collaborative development agreement or license agreement to develop a product candidate with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, the pharmaceutical or biotechnology company is generally expected to:        •    synthesize active pharmaceutical ingredients to be used in the product candidate;        •    design and conduct large scale clinical studies;        •    prepare and file documents necessary to obtain government approvals to sell a given product candidate; or        •    market and sell our products when and if they are approved.    Reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including:        •    the potential inability to control whether and the extent to which our collaborative partners will devote sufficient resources to the development programs or commercial efforts;        •    disputes which may arise in the future with respect to the ownership of rights to technology or intellectual property developed with collaborative partners;        •    disagreements with collaborative partners which could lead to delays in or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, or result in litigation or arbitration;        •    the potential for contracts with our collaborative partners to fail to provide significant protection or to be effectively enforced if one of these partners fails to perform. Collaborative partners have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional product candidates and may pursue alternative technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors;        •    the potential for collaborative partners with marketing rights to choose to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our products than they do to products of their own development;        •    the timing and level of resources that our collaborative partners’ dedicate to the development program will affect the timing and amount of revenue we receive;        •    risks related to the ability of our collaborative partners to pay us; and        •    the potential for collaborative partners to terminate their agreements with us unilaterally for any or no reason.    Given these risks, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative partner arrangements.    26    Table of Contents We have entered into collaborations in the past that have been subsequently terminated. If other collaborations are suspended or terminated, our ability to commercialize certain other proposed product candidates could also be negatively impacted. If our collaborations fail, our product development or commercialization of product candidates could be delayed or cancelled and it would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    If our preclinical testing or clinical trials or those of our collaborative partners are delayed or unsuccessful, our business could be significantly harmed.    All of our partner product candidates and proprietary product candidates are in research and development, including preclinical testing and clinical trials. Preclinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and uncertain processes. It may take us, or our collaborative partners, several years to complete clinical trials, and failure can occur at any stage and at any time. Typically, there is a high rate of attrition for product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not necessarily predict success in later clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later stage clinical trials due to such factors as inconclusive results and adverse medical events, even after achieving positive results earlier trials that were satisfactory to us, our collaborative partners and the reviewing regulatory agencies. If our partner product candidates or proprietary product candidates fail in clinical trial stage, it could have a significant and adverse impact on our business prospects.    We depend on third parties in the conduct of our proprietary product candidate clinical trials and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect our development and commercialization plans.    We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third party service providers and our collaborators in the conduct of clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials but do not control many aspects of their activities. For example, the investigators are not our employees. However, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates.    If we or our partners do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates on a timely basis or at all, or if the terms of any approval impose significant restrictions or limitations on use, then our revenues and results of operations may be affected negatively.    There is a risk that we, or our partners, will not obtain regulatory approval (which in some countries includes pricing approval) for product candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or that the terms of any approval will impose significant restrictions or limitations on use. Product candidates must undergo rigorous animal and human testing and an extensive FDA mandated or equivalent foreign authorities’ review process for safety and efficacy. This process generally takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The time required for completing such testing and obtaining such approvals is uncertain. The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies also have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials, require additional testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and mandate product withdrawals including recalls. Even though our partners have obtained regulatory approval for some of our products, these products and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Even if we or our partners receive regulatory approval of a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. In addition, any marketed products and manufacturing facilities used in the manufacture of such products will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections. Later discovery from such review and inspection of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketed products or on us, including withdrawal of such products from the market, recall, or suspension of our manufacturing     27    Table of Contents  operations. The failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of product candidates, any product marketing limitations or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    Our collaboration agreements with our partners contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes or litigation that could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, or financial condition.    We currently derive, and expect to derive in the foreseeable future, all of our revenue from collaboration agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These collaboration agreements contain complex commercial terms including:        •    research and development performance and reimbursement obligations for our personnel and other resources allocated to partner product development programs;        •    clinical and commercial manufacturing agreements, some of which are priced on an actual cost basis for products supplied to partners by us with complicated cost calculation and allocation formulas and methodologies;        •    intellectual property ownership allocation between us and our partners for improvements and new inventions developed during the course of the collaborative partnership;        •    royalties on end product sales based on a number of complex variables including net sales calculations, cost of goods, geography, patent life, and other financial metrics; and        •    indemnity obligations for third-party intellectual property, infringement, product liability and certain other claims.    From time to time, we have informal dispute resolution discussions with our partners regarding the appropriate interpretation of the complex commercial terms contained in our collaboration agreements. There can be no assurance that one or more disputes may arise in the future regarding our collaborative contracts which will not ultimately result in costly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, results of operations, or financial condition.    Because our proprietary product candidates are in the early stages of development, there is a high risk of failure, and we may never succeed in developing marketable products or generating revenue from our proprietary product candidates.    We are now applying our Pulmonary Technology and PEGylation Technology to our proprietary product development programs. None of our proprietary product candidates have received regulatory approval and our development efforts may never result in a commercialized product. Development of our proprietary products will require extensive additional time, effort and cost in preclinical testing and clinical trials. Our proprietary product candidates also require lengthy regulatory reviews before they can be marketed by us or our partners. Drug development is an uncertain process that involves trial and error, and we may fail at numerous stages along the way. In addition, it can also be very difficult to estimate the commercial potential of early stage product candidates due to such factors as safety and efficacy when compared to other available treatments, changing standards of care, patient and physician preferences and the availability competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the long development process or after commercial introduction.    Our investment in the development and commercialization of our proprietary product candidates prior to seeking partnering arrangements may be unsuccessful and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.    Our strategy is to fund our proprietary product development programs, including some or all of the clinical trials, prior to partnering with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. While we believe this strategy may result in improved economics for our proprietary product candidates, it will require significant investment by us     28    Table of Contents  without reimbursement. As a result, we bear an increased economic risk in the event one or more of our proprietary product candidates is not successful. Even if the product development is ultimately successful, our increased investment could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition prior to commercialization.    We may incur substantial litigation costs and liabilities, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.    Third parties from time to time have asserted or may assert that we or our commercial partners are infringing their proprietary rights based upon their patents that they believe cover our technology. In addition, future patents may issue to third parties that may give rise to similar assertions of infringement. We agree, in certain circumstances, to indemnify and hold harmless our collaborative partners from intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our commercial partners against any such claims. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability or the ability of our partners to develop or commercialize some or all of our products or product candidates in the United States and abroad, and could result in the award of substantial damages. We cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any pending litigation or future litigation. Costs associated with such litigation, substantial damage claims, indemnification claims, or royalties paid for licenses from third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.    On June 30, 2006, we entered into a litigation settlement related to an intellectual property dispute with the University of Alabama Huntsville pursuant to which we paid $11 million and agreed to pay an additional $10 million in equal $1 million installments over ten years beginning on July 1, 2007.    On August 1, 2006, Novo Nordisk filed a lawsuit against Pfizer in federal court claiming that Pfizer willfully infringes on Novo’s patents covering inhaled insulin with Exubera. The case is currently proceeding with discovery and other pre-trial activities. Although we are not currently a named party in this litigation, we have incurred litigation costs as a result of such litigation and may incur substantial future costs and potential indemnity claims from Pfizer associated with the litigation. These and other disputes may have a material impact on our business, results of operation and financial condition.    If any of our pending patent applications do not issue or following issuance are deemed invalid, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection. We rely on trade secret protection for important proprietary technologies.    We have filed patent applications (and we plan to file additional patent applications) covering, among other things, aspects of our Pulmonary Technology (in general and as it relates to specific molecules) including, without limitation, our powder processing technology, our powder formulation technology, and our inhalation device technology; our PEGylation Technology; and certain other early stage technologies. We own over 1,000 U.S. and foreign patents and a number of patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies. The patent positions of pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies, including ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues. There can be no assurance that patents we apply for will issue, or that patents that have issued will be valid and enforceable. Even if such patents are enforceable, we anticipate that any attempt to enforce our patents could be time consuming and costly. Additionally, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. As a consequence, we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in patents with broad coverage or whether the claims that eventually issue or that have issued will be circumvented. Since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lag behind the date such discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our patents or patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require us to cease using the technology in dispute.    29    Table of Contents U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications exist which comprise intellectual property rights and potential rights owned by third parties that relate to pharmaceutical compositions and reagents, medical devices, and equipment and methods for preparation, packaging, and delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, these rights will be considered relevant to our technology by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. There can be no assurance that we can obtain on reasonable terms, if at all, a license to any technology that we determine we need or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternate technology. The failure to obtain such licenses or obtain such alternative technology would have a material adverse effect on us.    We also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.    We may be required to obtain intellectual property licenses from third parties and there is a risk we may not be able to obtain such licenses on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.    Numerous pending and issued U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights owned by third parties relate to pharmaceutical compositions, medical devices, and equipment and methods for preparation, packaging, and delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, patent references will be considered relevant to our or our collaborative partners’ technology by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternate technology. The failure to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, if needed, would have a material adverse effect on us.    There is significant competition for our technology platforms and partnered and proprietary product and product candidates which could make our products, product candidates or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive and it would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    There are competitors to our platform technologies and partnered and proprietary products and product candidates. Some of our competitors with regard to our Pulmonary Technology include Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Alkermes, Inc., Aradigm Corporation, 3M, MannKind Corporation, Microdose Technologies Inc., Skyepharma and Vectura. Some of our competitors with regard to our PEGylation Technology include Dow Chemical Company, Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SunBio Corporation, Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Neose, NOF Corporation and Valentis, Inc., and there may be several chemical, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical companies also developing PEGylation technologies. Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others are developing the technology for internal use.    There are several direct competitors with development programs underway for inhaled insulin products. If these products are approved, they could be competitive to Exubera. These companies include Novo Nordisk, Alkermes, Inc. in collaboration with Eli Lilly Company, MannKind Corporation, and Kos Pharmaceuticals, all of which are working on various versions of inhaled insulin products in either a liquid or dry powder form. Some products are in late stage clinical testing including Alkermes’s inhalable insulin product (AIR Insulin System™) in Phase 3 clinical development and Mannkind’s Technosphere® Insulin System also in Phase 3 clinical development. There are other smaller companies that we believe are developing oral or buccal products for insulin delivery, such as Biocon, Emisphere Technologies, Inc., Coremed Corporation, and Generex Biotechnology Corporation. Exubera also competes with approved injectable insulins, including both fast-acting and longer-acting basal insulins. Lastly, Exubera competes with other treatment modalities for diabetes including oral agents and other injectable products approved for patients with Type 2 diabetes, such as Amilyn Pharmaceutical’s Byetta.    30    Table of Contents Many of our competitors have greater research and development capabilities, experience, manufacturing, marketing, financial and managerial resources than we do and represent significant competition for us. Acquisitions of or collaborations with competing drug delivery companies by large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies could enhance our competitors’ financial, marketing and other resources. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies, obtaining regulatory approval for products, or gaining market acceptance before us. Developments by others could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. There can be no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals, and commercialize next generation products or new products that will successfully compete with those of certain of our competitors.    If government and private insurance programs do not provide reimbursement for our partnered products or proprietary products, those products will not be widely accepted and it would have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations.    In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our partners’ products and any of our proprietary products that may be approved will depend in part upon pricing approvals by government authorities and the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government health administration authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In addition, such third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services. Significant uncertainty exists as to the pricing approvals for, and the reimbursement status of, newly approved health care products. For example, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients have current insulin therapies available to them, primarily injectable and oral insulin therapies. Therefore, an important factor in the commercial success of Exubera will be the timing and availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Moreover, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before regulatory agencies approve our proposed products for marketing. Adoption of such legislation and regulations could further limit pricing approvals for, and reimbursement of, medical products. A government or third-party payor decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursements of, our products would limit market acceptance of such products.    If we are not able to manufacture products in accordance with cGMP in commercially feasible quantities or at commercially feasible costs, then our proprietary product candidates or those of our partners will not be successfully commercialized.    If we are not able to scale-up manufacturing to meet the drug quantities required to support large clinical trials or commercial manufacturing in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost, we risk not meeting our collaborative partners’ supply requirements, our contractual obligations or supply requirements for our proprietary product candidates. Building and validating commercial-scale manufacturing facilities and processes, recruiting and training of qualified personnel and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals is complex, expensive and time-consuming. In addition, we also sometimes face very limited supply for certain critical raw materials from single or a limited number of suppliers that could constrain our manufacturing output. Failure to manufacture products in commercially feasible quantities or at commercially feasible costs, would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations and cause us not to meet our customers’ supply requirements, contractual obligations or requirements for our proprietary product candidates.    If earthquakes and other catastrophic events strike, our business may be negatively affected.    Our corporate headquarters, including a substantial portion of our research and development and manufacturing operations, are located in the San Francisco Peninsula, a region known for seismic activity. A significant natural disaster such as an earthquake would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There are no backup facilities for our manufacturing operations located in the San Francisco Peninsula and in the event of any earthquake or other natural disaster or terrorist event, we would not be able to manufacture and supply bulk powder drugs, such as the Exubera Inhalation Powder, without     31    Table of Contents  significant disruption. Certain of our collaborative partners located elsewhere may also be subject to catastrophic events such as hurricanes and tornadoes, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.    If we do not generate sufficient cash flow through increased revenues or raising additional capital, then we may not be able to meet our substantial debt obligations.    As of December 31, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and investments in marketable securities valued at approximately $467.0 million and approximately $447.9 million of indebtedness including approximately $417.7 million in convertible subordinated notes, $20.5 million in capital lease obligations and $9.7 million of other long-term liabilities. We expect to use a substantial portion of our cash to fund our on-going operations over the next few years and to repay the $102.7 million of convertible subordinated notes due in 2007. The remaining $315.0 million of convertible subordinated notes will mature in 2012.    Our substantial indebtedness has and will continue to impact us by:        •    making it more difficult to obtain additional financing;        •    constraining our ability to react quickly in an unfavorable economic climate; and        •    constraining our ability to invest in our proprietary product development programs.    Currently we are not generating positive cash flow. If Exubera is not successful it will adversely impact our ability to meet our debt obligations. In addition, if the market price of our common stock is below the related conversion price, the holders of the related outstanding convertible subordinated notes will not likely convert such securities to equity in accordance with their existing terms. If we are unable to satisfy our debt service requirements, substantial liquidity problems could result.    In the future, we may not generate sufficient cash from operations to repay our remaining convertible subordinated notes or satisfy any other of these obligations when they become due and may have to raise additional funds from the sale of equity or debt securities or otherwise restructure our obligations in order to do so. There can be no assurance that any such financing or restructuring will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.    If we cannot raise additional capital our financial condition may suffer.    Our capital needs may change as a result of numerous factors including without limitation significant investments in our proprietary product candidates, and may result in additional funding requirements. In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our stockholders.    We have no material credit facility or other material committed sources of capital. To the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital needs, we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies and proprietary products. Such funds may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. In particular, our substantial leverage may limit our ability to obtain additional financing. In addition, as an early stage biotechnology company, we do not qualify to issue investment grade debt and therefore any financing we do undertake will likely involve the issuance of equity, convertible debt instruments or high-yield debt. These sources of capital may not be available to us in the event we require additional financing. If adequate funds are not available on reasonable terms, we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing, supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms. Our inability to raise capital could negatively impact our business.    32    Table of Contents We recently appointed a new President and Chief Executive Officer and any failure or delay in successfully transitioning duties and responsibilities could have a negative impact on our business.    On January 15, 2007, Howard W. Robin was appointed as our President and Chief Executive Officer. Although Mr. Robin is a very experienced executive in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, any delays or inefficiencies in the transition of duties and responsibilities to Mr. Robin would have a negative impact on our business.    Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.    Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:        •    establishment of a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board may be elected at one time;        •    lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;        •    the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;        •    prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders;        •    establishment of advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and        •    limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.    Further, we have in place a preferred share purchase rights plan, commonly known as a “poison pill.” The provisions described above, our “poison pill” and provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market prices. We also have a change of control severance benefits plan which provides for certain cash severance, stock award acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition. This severance plan could discourage a third party from acquiring us.    We expect our stock price to remain volatile.    Our stock price is volatile. During the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2006, based on closing bid prices on the NASDAQ Stock Market, our stock price ranged from $13.10 to $22.75. We expect our stock price to remain volatile. A variety of factors may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock, including:        •    announcement of Exubera prescription and sales results;        •    clinical trial results or product development delays or delays in product approval or launch;        •    announcements by collaboration partners as to their plans or expectations related to products using our technologies;        •    announcements or terminations of collaborative relationships by us or our competitors;    33    Table of Contents     •    fluctuations in our results of operations;        •    developments in patent or other proprietary rights;        •    announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products that may compete with our approved products or products under development;        •    governmental regulation;        •    litigation brought against us or third parties to whom we have indemnification obligations;        •    public concern as to the safety of drug formulations developed by us or others; and        •    general market conditions.
