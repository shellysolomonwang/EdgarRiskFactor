Item 1A. Risk Factors    We are providing the following cautionary discussion of risk factors, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions that we believe are relevant to our businesses. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and our forward-looking statements. We note these factors for investors as permitted by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider this section to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may substantially impact our business.   Our revenue and results of operations will depend on the successful commercial launch of Exubera®.    We currently depend on Pfizer Inc as the source of a significant portion of our revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, revenue from Pfizer Inc accounted for 64% and 61%, respectively, of our total revenue. After receipt of regulatory approval for marketing in the U.S. and EU in January 2006 and the anticipated commercial launch of Exubera® by Pfizer Inc in 2006, we expect a significant portion of our future revenue from Pfizer Inc will come from the commercial manufacture and sale of bulk powder insulin to Pfizer Inc, the sale of Exubera® pulmonary inhalers and component parts to Pfizer Inc, and royalties from Exubera® product sales by Pfizer Inc. There can be no assurance regarding the timing or success of the Exubera® commercial launch which will depend on such factors as the timing, scope, and size of Pfizer Inc’s investment in the commercial launch of Exubera®, physician and patient education and experiences, third party payor reimbursement, country specific pricing approvals, and competition from alternative insulin therapies. If the commercial launch of Exubera® is delayed or not successful it would significantly and negatively impact our revenue and results of operations.    If we are not able to manufacture and supply sufficient quantities of powder formulated drugs to meet market demand it would negatively impact our revenue and results of operations.    Drug Powder Product Manufacturing    We have limited experience manufacturing powder drug products at commercial scale. With respect to drugs based on the Nektar Pulmonary Technology, such as Exubera®, we have only performed powder processing on the scale needed for larger clinical trials but not commercial production. We may encounter manufacturing and quality control problems as we scale-up powder processing to provide commercial quantities such as insulin powder manufacturing for Exubera®. We may not successfully scale-up or expand commercial production in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost, if at all. Our failure to scale up manufacturing could delay or prevent large scale clinical testing and commercialization of our products and would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. In addition, adding manufacturing capacity requires large capital investments and substantial periods of time to implement and obtain regulatory qualifications for additional manufacturing capacity. As a result of this manufacturing capacity limitation, unplanned fluctuations in demand could result in our inability to meet market demand or increased inventory requirements.    We anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of our insulin powder manufacturing facilities for compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. The results of these inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes, facility or capital equipment upgrades, or suspension or revocation of regulatory approval for our manufacturing site. Manufacturing delays pending resolution of regulatory suspensions or disqualifications would have a severe negative impact on our revenue and results of operations.    We rely primarily on two particular methods of powder processing. There is a risk that these technologies will not work with all drugs or that the cost of drug production with this processing will preclude the commercial viability of certain drugs. Additionally, there is a risk that any alternative powder processing methods we may pursue will not be commercially practical for aerosol drugs or that we will not have, or be able to acquire the rights to use, such alternative methods.    22    Table of Contents Drug Powder Packaging and Filling    Our fine particle powders and small quantity packaging utilized for drugs based on Nektar Pulmonary Technology, such as the Exubera® product, require special handling. We have designed and qualified automated filling equipment for small and moderate quantity packaging of fine powders and we have yet to prove that we can scale-up an automated filling system that can handle the small dose and particle sizes of our powders in commercial quantities. There is a risk that we will not be able to scale-up our automated filling equipment in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable costs. Any failure or delay in such scale-up would delay product development or substantially impede commercialization of products based on Nektar Pulmonary Technology and would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    There can be no assurance we will be able to manufacture products on our auto-filler system in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost. Any delay or failure in further developing such technology would delay product development or impede commercialization of our products and would have a materially adverse effect on our business.    We depend on two contract manufacturers to manufacture the Exubera® inhaler devices and the failure to manufacture sufficient quantities of inhalers to meet market demand would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    We depend on two contract manufacturers to manufacture our pulmonary inhaler device for Exubera®. Dependence on these two contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our Exubera® Inhaler devices and their suppliers may adversely affect our cost of goods and our ability to scale manufacturing to meet market demand. Because the manufacturing process for the Exubera® Inhaler is very complex and subject to extensive government regulations, alternative qualified contract manufacturers or increased capacity may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Increasing manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers involves risks and uncertainties including significant lead time requirements, increased capital investments, the recruitment and training of additional qualified personnel, and other operational complexities.    We also depend on the suppliers of our contract manufacturers to provide a large number of component parts for the Exubera® Inhaler in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis to meet market demand. A failure by one or more of these suppliers to provide sufficient parts or components on a timely basis to meet market demand would limit our Exubera® Inhaler production capacity and would have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations.    In addition, we anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of our contract manufacturers’ facilities. Although our contract manufacturers have obligations to comply with regulatory requirements, the results of these regulatory inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes, facility or capital equipment upgrades or expansion, or suspension or revocation of U.S. and/or EU approval for one or both of our contract manufacturers. Manufacturing delays pending resolution of regulatory suspensions or disqualifications would have a severe impact on our results of operations, financial position, contractual obligations, regulatory approvals, and market share.    If Pfizer Inc is not able to manufacture or fill the bulk insulin powder in sufficient quantities to meet market demand it would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    Pfizer Inc has responsibility for manufacturing approximately half of the bulk insulin powder for Exubera®. Pfizer may encounter manufacturing and control problems as they scale-up commercial scale powder processing. Pfizer may not be able to successfully achieve commercial scale-up to meet market demand. In addition, we anticipate periodic FDA inspections of Pfizer Inc’s bulk insulin powder manufacturing facilities for regulatory compliance. The results of these regulatory inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes, facility or capital equipment upgrades, suspension or revocation of FDA approval for Pfizer Inc manufacturing sites. Manufacturing delays pending resolution of FDA suspension or disqualifications would have a negative impact on our revenue, results of operations, regulatory approvals, and public confidence in the Exubera® product.    23    Table of Contents Pfizer Inc has responsibility for the automated filling of all of the insulin blister packs for Exubera®. We have developed and transferred to Pfizer Inc an automated filling technology which we believe will be capable of filling blisters on a production scale for Exubera®. There are significant technical challenges in scaling-up an automated filling system that can handle the small dose and particle sizes of our powders in commercial quantities. Any failure, delay, or lack of scale in the automated filling process would impede commercialization of Exubera® and would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    In February 2006, Pfizer Inc announced that it had closed a transaction to acquire sanofi-aventis’s partnership interest in the bulk insulin manufacturing facility located in Frankfurt, Germany. Any disruption in manufacturing as a result of post-acquisition integration challenges or other issues could impact the commercial supply of bulk insulin powder and it would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    The discovery of any new or more severe side effects or negative efficacy findings for Exubera® could significantly harm our business.    While the safety of Exubera® for patients has been extensively studied in clinical trials with generally mild to moderate side-effects to date, Pfizer Inc is conducting controlled long-term safety and efficacy studies of Exubera®. Exubera® is known to have certain side effects such as a small decrease in lung function generally within the first months of treatment, lowered blood sugar levels that typically occurs with other insulin therapies, and a mild cough within seconds to minutes after taking Exubera®. There can be no assurance that additional or more severe side effects or negative efficacy findings may be discovered based on Pfizer Inc’s long-term safety and efficacy studies or required reporting of adverse events regarding Exubera®, any of which could severely harm our business and result in one or more of the following regulatory events:        •   a voluntary or involuntary recall or market withdrawal of Exubera®;        •   labeling changes such as additional contraindications, warnings, precautions, or adverse reactions that would limit Exubera® market potential; and/or        •   a ‘boxed’ warning in the label; narrowing or other negative alterations to the labeling; restrictions on distribution.    In addition, one or more of the above factors would also have the potential to negatively impact pending and planned regulatory registrations for Exubera® in other countries.    If government and private insurance programs do not pay for our products they will not be widely accepted and it would have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations.    In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our products under development will depend in part upon pricing approvals by government authorities and the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government health administration authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In addition, such third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services. Significant uncertainty exists as to the pricing approvals for, and the reimbursement status of, newly approved health care products. For example, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients have current insulin therapies available to them, primarily injectable and oral insulin therapies. Pricing for Exubera® could be at a premium to currently available insulin therapies. Therefore, an important factor in the success of the Exubera® commercial launch will be the timing and availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Moreover, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before regulatory agencies approve our proposed products for marketing. Adoption of such legislation and regulations could further limit pricing approvals for, and reimbursement of, medical products. A government or third-party payor decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursements of, our products would limit market acceptance of such products.    24    Table of Contents If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.    The manufacture, testing, marketing and sale of medical products involves an inherent risk of product liability. If product liability costs exceed our product liability insurance coverage, we may incur substantial liabilities that could have a severe negative impact on our financial position. Whether or not we were ultimately successful in product liability litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, and might result in adverse publicity, all of which would impair our business. We may not be able to maintain our clinical trial insurance or product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all, and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims or losses.    If we are not successful in designing and developing new and next generation pulmonary inhaler devices it would negatively impact our revenue and results of operations.    We face many technical challenges in developing our pulmonary inhaler device to work with a broad range of drugs, to produce such devices in sufficient quantities once developed, and to adapt the devices to different powder formulations. Our pulmonary inhaler device being used with Exubera® has been approved by regulators in the U.S. and EU. Following commercialization of Exubera® or in connection with other pulmonary products that we are developing or may develop, additional design and development work may be required to optimize the device for field reliability, changes required by regulators or other issues that may be important to its commercial success such as device portability, convenience, reliability, and ease of use. Additional design and development work could lead to a delay in regulatory approval for any product that incorporates the device. There is a risk that we will not successfully meet one or more of these challenges and it would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    If our competitors develop and sell better drug delivery and formulation technologies, then our products or technologies may be uncompetitive or obsolete and it would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    We are aware of other companies engaged in developing and commercializing drug delivery and formulation technologies similar to our technologies. Some of our competitors with regard to Nektar Pulmonary Technology include Alexza MDC, Alkermes, Inc., Aradigm Corporation, 3M, MannKind Corporation, Microdose Technologies Inc., Quadrant Technologies Limited, Skyepharma, and Vectura. In the non-invasive delivery of insulin, there are companies working on inhaled insulin products such as Aradigm Corporation, Alkermes, Inc., Microdose Technologies Inc., Quadrant Technologies Limited, and MannKind Corporation, all of which are working on pulmonary products and most with announced pharmaceutical partners. Although none of these products are currently approved, if they are approved in any of the markets where Exubera® is approved, this could affect our revenues from Exubera®. In particular, certain of our competitors have announced inhaled insulin programs that, if approved, could compete with Exubera® based on smaller devices and/or different insulin formulations that may provide increased efficacy, convenience, ease of use, and/or reliability. Some of our competitors with regard to Nektar Advanced PEGylation Technology include Dow Chemical Company, SunBio Corporation, Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Neose, NOF Corporation, and Valentis, Inc., and there may be several chemical, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical companies also developing PEGylation technologies. Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others are developing the technology for internal use.    Many of our competitors have greater research and development capabilities, experience, manufacturing, marketing, financial and managerial resources than we do and represent significant competition for us. Acquisitions of or collaborations with competing drug delivery companies by large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies could enhance our competitors’ financial, marketing and other resources. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies, obtaining regulatory approval for products, or gaining market acceptance before us. Developments by others could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. For example, certain competitors for our Exubera® product could successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval, and commercialize a more convenient, easy to use, smaller pulmonary     25    Table of Contents  insulin inhaler device for insulin which could negatively impact market share for Exubera®. There can be no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals, and commercialize next generation products or new products that will successfully compete with those of certain of our competitors.    If the collaborative partners we depend on to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our partner products are not successful, or if such collaborations fail, then the product development or commercialization of our partner products may be delayed or unsuccessful.    When we sign a collaborative development agreement or license agreement to develop a product with a drug or biotechnology company, the drug or biotechnology company is generally expected to:        •   synthesize active pharmaceutical ingredients to be used as medicines;        •   design and conduct large scale clinical studies;        •   prepare and file documents necessary to obtain government approvals to sell a given drug product; and/or        •   market and sell our products when and if they are approved.    Reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including:        •   the potential inability to control whether and the extent to which our collaborative partners will devote sufficient resources to our programs or products;        •   disputes which may arise in the future with respect to the ownership of rights to technology and/or intellectual property developed with collaborative partners;        •   disagreements with collaborative partners which could lead to delays in or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, or result in litigation or arbitration;        •   the potential for contracts with our collaborative partners to fail to provide significant protection or to be effectively enforced if one of these partners fails to perform. Collaborative partners have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional products and may pursue alternative technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors;        •   the potential for collaborative partners with marketing rights to choose to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our products than they do to products of their own development;        •   risks related to the ability of our collaborative partners to pay us; and        •   the potential for collaborative partners to terminate their agreements with us unilaterally for any or no reason.    Given these risks, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts.    We have entered into collaborations in the past that have been subsequently terminated. If other collaborations are suspended or terminated, our ability to commercialize certain other proposed products could also be negatively impacted. If our collaborations fail, our product development or commercialization of products could be delayed or cancelled and it would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    If we are not able to manufacture our dry powder inhaler device in commercially feasible quantities or at commercially feasible costs, then our Pulmonary Technology products may not be successfully commercialized.    In addition to our inhaler device being used with Exubera®, we are developing a breath-actuated compact dry powder inhaler device (“DPI”). We are developing the DPI device to be appropriate for the delivery of either     26    Table of Contents  large or small molecules for short-term use. We face many unique technical challenges in developing the DPI device to work with a broad range of drugs, producing the DPI device in sufficient quantities and adapting the DPI device to different powder formulations. Our DPI device is still in clinical testing and production scale-up work is ongoing. Further design and development will be required to obtain regulatory approval for the DPI device, enable commercial manufacturing, insure field reliability or manage other issues that may be important to its commercial success. Such additional design and development work may lead to a delay in efforts to obtain regulatory approval for any product that incorporates the DPI device, or could delay the timeframe within which the device could be ready for commercial launch. There is a risk that we will not successfully achieve any of these challenges. Our failure to overcome any of these challenges would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    Our increasing investment in the development and commercialization of our proprietary products prior to seeking partnering arrangements may be unsuccessful and adversely impact our financial condition and liquidity.    We intend to fund significant development expenses associated with the development and commercialization of new products, including clinical trials, prior to seeking collaborative relationships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners. While we believe this strategy may result in improved economics for any products ultimately developed and approved, it will require us to invest significant funds in developing these products without reimbursement from a collaborative partner. If we are ultimately not able to negotiate acceptable collaborative arrangements with respect to these products, or any arrangements we do negotiate are not successful, we may not receive an adequate return on these investments and our results of operations and financial condition would suffer. Even if our development efforts are ultimately successful, our increased investment in the development of these products could adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity prior to their commercialization.    If we fail to establish future successful collaborative relationships, then our financial results may suffer and our product development efforts may be delayed or unsuccessful.    We intend to seek future collaborative relationships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to fund some of our research and development expenses and to develop and commercialize potential products. Further, we anticipate that the timing of drug development programs under existing collaborative agreements with our partners will continue to affect our revenues from such agreements. We may not be able to negotiate acceptable collaborative arrangements in the future, and any arrangements we do negotiate may not be successful. If we fail to establish additional collaborative relationships, we will be required to undertake research, development, marketing, and manufacturing of our proprietary product programs at our own expense or discontinue or reduce these activities.    If our technologies are not commercially feasible, then it would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    We are in an early stage of development with respect to most of our products. There is a risk that our technologies will not be commercially feasible. Even if our technologies are commercially feasible, they may not be commercially accepted across a range of large and small molecule drugs. Exubera® is the only product using Nektar Pulmonary Technology that has been approved for use. Although the Nektar Advanced PEGylation Technology has been incorporated in six products most of the products incorporating this technology are still in clinical trials. The Nektar SCF Technology is in an early stage of feasibility testing. Our potential products require extensive research, development and preclinical and clinical testing. Our potential products also may involve lengthy regulatory reviews and require regulatory approval before they can be sold. We do not know if, and cannot provide assurance that, any of our potential products will prove to be safe and effective, accomplish the objectives that we or our collaborative partners are seeking through the use of our technologies, meet regulatory standards, or continue to meet such standards if already approved. There is a risk that we, or our     27    Table of Contents  collaborative partners, may not be able to produce any of our potential products in commercial quantities at acceptable costs, or market them successfully. Failure to achieve commercial feasibility, demonstrate safety, achieve clinical efficacy, obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully market products will negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    If our pre-clinical or clinical testing trials are delayed or unsuccessful, then we will experience delay or be unsuccessful in having our products commercialized, and our business will be significantly harmed.    Except for Exubera® and products using Nektar Advanced PEGylation Technology that have already been approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, our product candidates are still in research and development, including preclinical testing and clinical trials. Preclinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and uncertain processes. It may take us, or our collaborative partners, several years to complete these trials, and failure can occur at any stage in the process. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later stage clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials.    Any clinical trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to us, our collaborative partners, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities. Preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval or commercialization. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be repeated or a program to be terminated. We typically rely on collaborative partners and third-party clinical investigators to conduct clinical trials of our products and, as a result, we may face additional delaying factors outside our control.    We do not know if any of our research and development efforts, including preclinical testing or clinical trials, will adhere to our planned schedules or be completed on a timely basis or at all. Typically, there is a high rate of attrition for product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials.    If our technologies do not satisfy certain basic feasibility requirements such as total system efficiency and the ability to efficiently attached PEG polymer chains, then our products may not be commercially feasible or competitive.    We may not be able to achieve the total system efficiency for products based on our Pulmonary Technology that is needed to be competitive with alternative routes of delivery or formulation technologies. We determine total system efficiency by the amount of drug loss during manufacture, in the delivery system, and in reaching the ultimate site at which the drug exhibits its activity. We would not consider a drug to be a good candidate for development and commercialization using our Pulmonary Technology if drug loss is excessive at any one stage or cumulatively in the manufacturing and delivery process.    Our ability to efficiently attach PEG polymer chains to a drug molecule is the initial screen for determining whether drug formulations using our Advanced PEGylation Technology are commercially feasible. We would not consider a drug formulation to be a good candidate for development and commercialization using our Advanced PEGylation Technology if we could not efficiently attach a PEG polymer chain to such drug without destroying the drug’s activity.    If our drug formulations are not stable, then we will not be able to develop or commercialize products.    We may not be able to identify and produce powdered or other formulations of drugs that retain the physical and chemical properties needed to work effectively with our inhaler devices for deep lung delivery using our Pulmonary Technology, or through other methods of drug delivery using our Advanced PEGylation Technology. Formulation stability is the physical and chemical stability of the drug over time and under various storage, shipping and usage conditions. Formulation stability will vary with each drug formulation and the type and     28    Table of Contents  amount of ingredients that are used in the formulation. Since our drug formulation technology is new and largely unproven, we do not know if our drug formulations will retain the needed physical and chemical properties and performance of the drugs. Problems with formulated drug powder stability in particular would negatively impact our ability to develop products based on our Pulmonary Technology or Supercritical Fluid Technology, or obtain regulatory approval for or market such products.    If our drug delivery technologies are not safe, then regulatory approval of our (or our partners) products may not be obtained, or our (or our partners) products may not be developed or marketed of our (or our partners) products may be suspended following commercialization.    We, or our collaborative partners, may not be able to prove that potential products using our technologies are safe. Our products require lengthy laboratory, animal and human testing. We cannot be certain that these products, and our technology upon which these products are based, will be safe or will not produce adverse side effects. The safety of our formulations will vary with each drug and the ingredients used in our formulation. If any product is found not to be safe, the product will not be approved for marketing or commercialization. In addition, even if a product is approved and commercialized, regulatory authorities could still later suspend or terminate the license to market the product if it is determined that the product does not meet safety or other standards.    If the products using Nektar Pulmonary Technology do not provide consistent doses of medicine, then we will not be able to develop, and we or our partners will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize products.    We may not be able to provide reproducible dosing of stable formulations of drug compounds. Reproducible dosing is the ability to deliver a consistent and predictable amount of drug into the bloodstream over time both for a single patient and across patient groups. Reproducible dosing of drugs based on our Pulmonary Technology requires the development of:        •   an inhalation or other device that consistently delivers predictable amounts of dry powder to the deep lung;        •   accurate unit dose packaging of dry powder; and        •   moisture resistant packaging.    Since our Pulmonary Technology is still in development and has only been approved for Exubera® and has yet to be commercialized on a broad scale, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop reproducible dosing of any potential product.    If we or our partners do not obtain regulatory approval for our products on a timely basis, then our revenues and results of operations may be affected negatively.    There is a risk that we, or our partners, will not obtain regulatory approval (which in some countries includes pricing approval) for unapproved products on a timely basis, or at all. Unapproved products must undergo rigorous animal and human testing and an extensive FDA mandated or equivalent foreign authorities’ review process. This process generally takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The time required for completing such testing and obtaining such approvals is uncertain. The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies also have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials, require additional testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and mandate product withdrawals including recalls. Even though our partners have obtained regulatory approval for some of our products, these products and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Even if we or our partners receive regulatory approval of a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. In addition, any marketed products and manufacturing facilities used in the manufacture of such products will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections.     29    Table of Contents  Later discovery from such review and inspection of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketed products or on us, including withdrawal of such products from the market, voluntary recall, or suspension of our manufacturing operations. The failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of products, any product marketing limitations or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    In addition, we may encounter delays or rejections based upon changes in FDA regulations or policies, including policies relating to cGMP, during the period of product development. We or our partners may encounter similar delays in other countries.    If our technologies cannot be integrated successfully to bring products to market, then our or our partners’ ability to develop, obtain approval for, or market products, may be delayed or unsuccessful.    We may not be able to integrate all of the relevant technologies to provide complete drug delivery and formulation systems. In particular, our development of drugs based on our Pulmonary Technology relies upon the following several different but related technologies:        •   dry powder formulations;        •   dry powder processing technology;        •   dry powder packaging technology; and        •   deep lung delivery devices.    Our other technologies may face similar challenges relating to the integration of drug formulation, processing, packaging and delivery device technologies. At the same time we or our partners must:        •   perform laboratory, pre-clinical, and clinical testing of potential products; and        •   scale-up manufacturing processes.    All of these steps must be accomplished without delaying any aspect of product development. Any delay in one component of product or business development could delay our or our partners’ ability to develop, obtain approval for, or market products using our delivery and formulation technologies.    If we are not able to manufacture products using Nektar Advanced PEGylation Technology in commercially feasible quantities or at commercially feasible costs, then our products will not be successfully commercialized.    If we are not able to scale-up to large clinical trials or commercial manufacturing for products based on Nektar Advanced PEGylation Technology in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost, we risk not meeting our customers’ supply requirements or our contractual obligations. Production problems encountered during the second and third quarters of 2004 resulted in the temporary shutdown of our manufacturing facility with respect to our Advanced PEGylation products. This resulted in a decrease in product revenues and gross margin compared to 2003. Although we believe we have addressed these manufacturing problems by expanding our manufacturing capacity, our failure to satisfactorily address these issues in the future or additional production problems may negatively impact our product revenues and results of operations in future periods. In addition, our failure to solve any of these problems could delay or prevent late stage clinical testing, regulatory approval for, and commercialization of our products using Nektar Advanced PEGylation Technology and could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    If the market does not accept products based on our technologies, then our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected.    The commercial success of our potential products depends upon market acceptance by health care providers, third-party payors like health insurance companies and government reimbursement programs, and patients. Our     30    Table of Contents  products under development use new technologies and there is a risk that the market will not accept our potential products. Market acceptance will depend on many factors, including:        •   the safety and efficacy of products demonstrated in clinical trials;        •   favorable regulatory approval and product labeling;        •   the frequency of product use;        •   the ease of product use;        •   the availability of third-party reimbursement;        •   the availability of alternative technologies; and        •   the price of our products relative to alternative technologies.    There is a risk that health care providers, patients or a third party payors will not accept products using our drug delivery and formulation technologies. If the market does not accept our potential products, our revenues and results of operations would be significantly and negatively impacted.    If any of our pending patent applications do not issue or following issuance are deemed invalid or if any of our patents are deemed invalid, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection. If any of our products infringe third-party intellectual property rights, we may suffer adverse effects to our ability to develop and commercialize products and to our revenues and results from operations.    We have filed patents applications (and we plan to file additional patent applications) covering, among other things, aspects of: Nektar Pulmonary Technology (in general and as it relates to specific molecules) including, without limitation, our powder processing technology, our powder formulation technology, and our inhalation device technology; our Advanced PEGylation Technology; and certain other early stage technologies. As of December 31, 2005, we owned 1,018 issued U.S. and foreign patents that cover various aspects of our technologies, and we have a number of patent applications pending.    The patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and drug delivery companies, including ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues. There can be no assurance that patents we apply for will be issued, or that patents that are issued will be valid and enforceable. Even if such patents are enforceable, we anticipate that any attempt to enforce our patents could be time consuming and costly. Additionally, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. As a consequence, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will be granted with broad coverage or whether the claims that eventually issue or that have issued will be circumvented. Since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require us to cease using the technology in dispute.    Numerous pending and issued U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights owned by third parties relate to pharmaceutical compositions and reagents, medical devices, and equipment and methods for preparation, packaging, and delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, patent references will be considered relevant to our technology by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternate technology. The failure to obtain licenses if needed would have a material adverse effect on us.    31    Table of Contents We also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.    Third parties from time to time have asserted or may assert that we are infringing their proprietary rights based upon issued patents, trade secrets or know-how that they believe cover our technology. In addition, future patents may be issued to third parties that our technology may infringe. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our partners against any such claims. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the United States and abroad, and could result in the award of substantial damages. In the event of a claim of infringement, we and our partners may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties. There can be no assurance that our partners and we will be able to obtain such licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such required license could have a material adverse effect on us.    Access, or our partners’ access, to drugs to be formulated using our various delivery technologies affects our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies. We intend generally to rely on the ability of our partners to provide access to drugs that we formulate for pulmonary and other forms of delivery. There is a risk that our partners will not be able to provide access to such drugs. This situation is complex, and as such, the ability of any one company, including us, to commercialize a particular drug is unpredictable.    In addition, formulations of drugs that are presently under development by us, as well as our drug formulation and delivery technologies, may be subject to issued U.S. and foreign patents (and may be subject in the future to patents that issue from pending patent applications) owned by competitors. Therefore, even if our partners provide access to drugs for the formulation of pulmonary and other forms of delivery, there is a risk that third parties will accuse, and possibly a court or a governmental agency will determine, that we and/or our partners infringe third party patent rights covering such drugs and/or the formulation or delivery technologies utilizing such drugs, and we will be prohibited from working with the drug or formulation or delivery technology, or we will be found liable for damages that may not be subject to indemnification, or we may elect to pay such third party royalties under a license to such patent rights if one is available. Any such restrictions on access to drugs, liability for damages, prohibition, or payment of royalties would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    We may incur material litigation costs, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.    In July 2005, a complaint was filed by The Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama (“UAH”) against Nektar Therapeutics AL, Corporation, and Nektar Therapeutics in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The complaint alleges patent infringement, breach of a contract royalty obligation, violation of the Alabama Trade Secrets Act, and unjust enrichment. In August 2005, UAH amended its complaint to add J. Milton Harris, a Nektar employee, as a party to the litigation, add certain additional claims, seek declaratory judgment on patents assigned to the Company, and seek compensatory, treble and punitive damages, all in unspecified amounts. In December 2005, UAH filed its second amended complaint expanding its previously asserted claims that the Company and Harris had infringed patents of UAH, misappropriated and taken intellectual property rightfully belonging to UAH, concealed intellectual property from UAH that was rightfully the property of UAH, and converted these discoveries for their own profit notwithstanding that the Company and Harris were fully aware that the inventions rightfully belonged to UAH. UAH further claimed fraudulent concealment, conversion, detinue, misrepresentation, conspiracy, and, as against Harris, breach of express and implied contract and breach of an assignment of application. UAH is seeking equitable relief including declaratory judgment, the imposition of a constructive trust, specific performance, injunction, accounting and other relief on the theory that UAH should be the record holder of certain patent’s assigned to the Company. We have filed and continue to assert a counterclaim against UAH seeking full refund of all royalty     32    Table of Contents  payments erroneously paid to UAH under the patent at issue in the original complaint. The litigation is at too early a stage to make an assessment about the probability of the outcome in the case. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this litigation, however, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in such defense.    From time to time, we are party to various other litigation matters, including several that relate to our patent and intellectual property rights. We cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any pending litigation or potential future litigation, and we might have to incur substantial expense in defending these or future lawsuits or indemnifying third parties with respect to the results of such litigation.    If earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and other catastrophic events strike, our business may be negatively affected.    Our corporate headquarters, including a substantial portion of our research and development and manufacturing operations, are located in the San Francisco Peninsula, a region known for seismic activity. A significant natural disaster such as an earthquake could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There are no backup facilities for some of our manufacturing operations located in the San Francisco Peninsula and in the event of any earthquake or other natural disaster or terrorist event, we would not be able to manufacture and supply bulk powder drugs without significant disruption to certain of our other facilities and certain of our collaborative partners located elsewhere may also be subject to catastrophic events such as hurricanes and tornadoes, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.    Investors should be aware of industry-wide risks, which are applicable to us and may affect our revenues and results of operations.    In addition to the risks associated specifically with us described above, investors should also be aware of general risks associated with drug development and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. These include, but are not limited to:        •   changes in and compliance with government regulations;        •   handling and disposal of hazardous materials;        •   workplace health and safety requirements;        •   hiring and retaining qualified people; and        •   insuring against product liability claims.    If we do not generate sufficient cash flow through increased revenues or raising additional capital, then we may not be able to meet our substantial debt obligations.    As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $417.7 million in long-term convertible subordinated notes, $20.3 million in non-current capital lease obligations, and $21.8 million in other long-term liabilities. Our substantial long-term indebtedness, which totaled $459.8 million as of December 31, 2005, has and will continue to impact us by:        •   making it more difficult to obtain additional financing; and        •   constraining our ability to react quickly in an unfavorable economic climate.    Currently we are not generating positive cash flow. Delay or lack of success in the commercial launch of Exubera®, or other adverse occurrences related to our product development efforts will adversely impact our ability to meet our obligations to repay the principal amounts on our convertible subordinated notes when due. In addition, if the market price of our common stock is below the related conversion price, the holders of the related outstanding     33    Table of Contents  convertible subordinated notes will not likely convert such securities to equity in accordance with their existing terms. If we are unable to satisfy our debt service requirements, substantial liquidity problems could result. As of December 31, 2005 we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments valued at approximately $566.4 million. We expect to use a substantial portion of these assets to fund our on-going operations over the next few years. Of our approximately $417.7 million of convertible subordinated notes outstanding as of December 31, 2005, $102.7 million will mature in 2007, and the remaining $315.0 million will mature in 2012. We may not generate sufficient cash from operations to repay our convertible subordinated notes or satisfy any other of these obligations when they become due and may have to raise additional funds from the sale of equity or debt securities or otherwise restructure our obligations in order to do so. There can be no assurance that any such financing or restructuring will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.    If we cannot raise additional capital our financial condition may suffer.    Our capital needs may change as a result of numerous factors including without limitation significant investments in our proprietary product programs, and may result in additional funding requirements. In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our stockholders.    We have no material credit facility or other material committed sources of capital. To the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements, we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies and products. Such funds may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. In particular, our substantial leverage may limit our ability to obtain additional financing. In addition, as an early stage biotechnology company, we do not qualify to issue investment grade debt and therefore any financing we do undertake will likely involve the issuance of equity, convertible debt instruments and/or high-yield debt. These sources of capital may not be available to us in the event we require additional financing. If adequate funds are not available on reasonable terms, we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing, supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms. Our inability to raise capital could negatively impact our business.    If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business may suffer.    Our ability to offer commercially viable products, achieve our expansion objectives, manage our growth effectively and satisfy our commitments under our collaboration agreements depend on a variety of factors, all of which must be successfully managed. Key factors include our ability to develop products internally, enter into strategic partnerships with collaborators, attract and retain skilled employees and effectively expand our internal organization to accommodate anticipated growth including integration of any potential businesses that we may acquire. If we are unable to manage some or all of these factors effectively, our business could grow too slowly or too quickly to be successfully sustained, thereby resulting in material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.    If we fail to manage our executive officer transitions, our business may suffer.    In the first quarter of 2006, our former Chief Financial Officer resigned and our Chief Executive Officer has announced his resignation. Although we believe our current Chief Financial Officer is very experienced and our interim Chief Executive Officer has been involved with the Company for a significant period of time as a prior executive officer and director, any delays or inefficiencies in the transition of responsibilities may also hinder our growth and progress. In addition, we are currently in the process of recruiting a new Chief Executive Officer and a prolonged delay in successfully recruiting this person or inefficiencies in the transition of duties may also hinder our growth and progress.    34    Table of Contents If we acquire additional companies, products or technologies, we may not be able to effectively integrate personnel and operations and such failure may disrupt our business and results of operations.    We have acquired companies, products and/or technologies in the past, and may continue to acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies in the future. We may not receive the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments. We may face risks relating to difficult integrations of personnel, technology and operations, uncertainty whether any integration will be successful and whether earnings will be negatively affected, and potential distractions to our management with respect to these acquisitions. In addition, our earnings may suffer because of acquisition-related costs.    We expect to continue to lose money for the next few years and may not reach profitability if our products do not generate sufficient revenue.    We have never had a profitable year and, through December 31, 2005, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $902.2 million. We expect to continue to incur substantial and potentially increasing losses over at least the next few years as we expand our research and development efforts, testing activities and manufacturing operations, and as we further expand our late stage clinical and early commercial production facilities. Most of our potential products are in the early stages of development. Our revenues to date have consisted primarily of payments under short-term research and feasibility agreements and development contracts.    To achieve and sustain profitable operations, we must, alone or with others, successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, introduce, market and sell products using our drug delivery technologies. In particular, the successful commercial launch and market acceptance of Exubera® will be very important to our financial condition. There is risk that we will not generate sufficient product or contract research revenue to become profitable or to sustain profitability.    Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.    Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:        •   establishment of a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board may be elected at one time;        •   lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;        •   the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;        •   prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders;        •   establishment of advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and        •   limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.    Further, we have in place a preferred share purchase rights plan, commonly known as a “poison pill.” The provisions described above, our “poison pill” and provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market prices.    35    Table of Contents We expect our stock price to remain volatile.    Our stock price is volatile. In the twelve-month year ending December 31, 2005, based on closing bid prices on The NASDAQ National Market, our stock price ranged from $13.41 to $19.80. We expect our stock price to remain volatile. A variety of factors may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock, including:        •   announcement of results indicating the level of success of the commercial launch and market acceptance of Exubera®;        •   clinical trial results or product development delays or delays in product approval or launch;        •   announcements by collaboration partners as to their plans or expectations related to products using our technologies;        •   announcements or terminations of collaborative relationships by us or our competitors;        •   fluctuations in our results of operations;        •   developments in patent or other proprietary rights;        •   announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products that may compete with our approved products or products under development;        •   governmental regulation;        •   litigation brought against us;        •   public concern as to the safety of drug formulations developed by us or others; and        •   general market conditions.    New and potential new accounting pronouncements may impact our future financial position and results of operations.    There may be potential new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings, which may have an impact on our future financial position and results of operations. For example, in December 2004, the FASB issued an amendment to SFAS No. 123, Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation (“FAS 123R”). We have implemented this standard for the reporting period commencing January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 123 eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB 25”), and instead requires companies to recognize compensation expense using a fair-value based method for costs related to share-based payments including stock options, [restricted stock awards], and employee stock purchase plans. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R will materially impact our financial position and results of operations for future periods. Our actual share-based compensation expense in 2006 and subsequent periods will be dependent on a number of factors, including the amount of awards granted and the fair value of those awards at the time of grant. Also, a change in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. Other new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules, future changes, if any, or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business, which may also adversely affect our stock price.    Our business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.    We are subject to rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and NASDAQ, have issued new requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to     36    Table of Contents  recent laws enacted by Congress, most notably The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”). Our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, substantial general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to SOX compliance activities.    In particular, our efforts to comply with Section 404 of SOX and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors’ audit of that assessment has required, and continues to require, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. Our management determined, as of the year ended December 31, 2004, that we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. We began our remediation efforts in the first half of 2005 and management continued to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting through December 31, 2005, when we concluded that there were no deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that would constitute a material weakness as of that date. Although we are making additional improvements in our internal controls over financial reporting, in future periods we may conclude that we have one or more material weaknesses, and remedying these material weaknesses may require significant additional financial and managerial resources and could result in a loss of investor confidence in our internal controls and financial reporting.    Moreover, because these laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. The continuing uncertainty that we will meet or continue to meet the requirements of these laws, regulations, and standards, may negatively impact our business operations and financial position.
