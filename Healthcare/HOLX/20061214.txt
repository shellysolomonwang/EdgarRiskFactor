Item 1A. Risk Factors    This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our objectives, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.    Risks Relating to Acquisitions    Our business may be harmed by our recently completed acquisitions.    We have acquired related businesses, technologies, product lines, and products from Suros Surgical Systems, Inc., R2 Technology, Inc. and AEG Elektrofotografie GmbH. The success of these acquisitions will depend on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquired businesses with our own. We may fail to realize these anticipated benefits for a number of reasons, including the following:        •   problems may arise with our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses, which may result in the combined companies not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected, which problems may include:        •   diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration;        •   failure to retain and motivate key employees;        •   failure to successfully manage relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers;        •   failure of customers to accept new products;        •   failure to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts;        •   failure to combine product offerings and product lines quickly and effectively;        •   failure to effectively enhance acquired technology and products or develop new products relating to the acquired businesses;        •   potential difficulties and inefficiencies in managing and operating businesses in multiple locations or operating businesses in which we have either limited or no direct experience;        •   potential difficulties integrating financial reporting systems; and        •   potential difficulties in implementing controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to our acquisition had lacked such controls, procedures and policies;    17        •   we may not be able to achieve the expected synergies from an acquisition or it may take longer than expected to achieve those synergies;        •   an acquisition may involve unexpected costs or liabilities, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from our expectations; and        •   the acquired businesses may be adversely affected by future legislative, regulatory, or tax changes as well as other economic, business and/or competitive factors.    Our acquisition of AEG Elektrofotografie, which conducts its business worldwide, with headquarters in Germany and manufacturing operations in Germany and China, is subject to the additional challenges and risks associated with volatility in the market for organic photoconductor coatings used for laser printer cartridges, and the company’s international operations, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risk and the particular economic, legal, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.    The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of our recent acquisitions.    The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of our recent acquisitions for a number of reasons, including the following:        •   we have expended significant funds, incurred significant debt and issued a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions, which may negatively affect our results of operations and be dilutive to our stockholders;        •   the perceived benefits we anticipate of the acquisitions may not be consistent with those perceived by financial or industry analysts or by investors;        •   the combined companies may not achieve the expected benefits of the acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or by investors;        •   the effect of the acquisitions on our financial results may not be consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts or of investors; and        •   our significant stockholders, or stockholders of the acquired entities may decide to dispose of their shares of our common stock.    Our business may be harmed by acquisitions we complete in the future.    Our identification of suitable acquisition candidates involves risks inherent in assessing the values, strengths, weaknesses, risks and profitability of acquisition candidates, including the effects of the possible acquisition on our business, diversion of our management’s attention and risks associated with unanticipated problems or latent liabilities. If we are successful in pursuing future acquisitions, we will be required to expend significant funds, incur additional debt or issue additional securities, which may negatively affect our results of operations and be dilutive to our stockholders. If we spend significant funds or incur additional debt, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline, and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete. Should we acquire another business, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing business.    We may incur significant additional and unforeseen expenses and costs to defend or pursue litigation, investigations or other inquiries in connection with acquisitions that we complete.    We may become subject to litigation, investigations or inquiries in connection with acquisitions that we complete, which may cause us to incur significant additional and unforeseen costs to defend or pursue litigation     18     or investigations or other inquiries relating to the acquisition. In connection with our acquisition in September 2005 of the mammography intellectual property assets from Fischer, including the rights to their SenoScan digital mammography and MammoTest stereotactic breast biopsy systems, we became subject to a non-public Federal Trade Commission investigation to determine if the acquisition of certain of those assets may be anticompetitive and in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act or Section 5 of the FTC Act. In July 2006, we entered into a consent agreement with the FTC to resolve our dispute with the FTC regarding our acquisition of the MammoTest stereotactic breast biopsy system intellectual property acquired as part of the mammography intellectual property assets purchased from Fischer. As part of the consent agreement, we agreed to sell and license back, on a royalty-free nonexclusive basis, all of the intellectual property relating to the Mammotest system to Siemens AG. The consent agreement and agreement with Siemens received final approval from the FTC on August 9, 2006.    Risks relating to our business    The markets for our direct-to-digital full-field mammography products are relatively new and may not develop as expected.    We cannot assure that the markets for our direct-to-digital full-field mammography products will continue to develop. There is a significant installed base of conventional screen-film mammography products in hospitals and radiological practices. The use of our direct-to-digital mammography products in many cases would require these potential customers to either modify or replace their existing x-ray imaging equipment. Moreover, as direct-to-digital mammography products are generally more expensive than conventional screen-firm mammography products, we believe that a major factor in the market’s acceptance of direct-to-digital mammography products has been and will continue to be based upon the benefits direct-to-digital technology as compared to less expensive technologies. As a result, the market for our direct-to-digital mammography products has and will continue to be affected by published studies and reports relating to the comparative efficacy of digital mammography products, and the publication of an adverse study could significantly impair the adoption of this technology and harm our business. The implementation of digital mammography technology is also affected by the trend toward transition by the healthcare industry from conventional film archiving systems to hospital Picture Archiving and Communications Systems, known as PACS, to store x-ray images electronically. Because the benefits of our direct-to-digital mammography technology may not be fully realized by customers until they install a PACS platform, a large potential market for these products may not develop until PACS environments are more widely used. Because the markets for these products are relatively new, it is likely that our evaluation of the potential markets for these products will materially vary with time.    We depend on third party reimbursement to our customers for market acceptance of our products. Failure of third party payors to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for use of our products could harm our business and prospects.    Sales of medical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients’ medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. The costs of our products are substantial, and market acceptance of our products depends upon our customers’ ability to obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement from third-party payors for use of our products. In the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, known as CMS, establishes guidelines for the reimbursement of healthcare providers treating Medicare and Medicaid patients. Under current CMS guidelines, varying reimbursement levels have been established for mammography, breast biopsy, CAD and bone density assessment and other imaging and diagnostic procedures performed by our products. The actual reimbursement amounts are determined by individual state Medicare carriers and, for non-Medicare and Medicaid patients, private insurance carriers. There are often delays between the reimbursement approvals by CMS and by a state Medicare carrier and private insurance carriers. Moreover, states as well as private insurance carriers may choose not to follow the CMS reimbursement guidelines. The use of our products outside the United States is similarly affected by reimbursement policies adopted by foreign regulatory and insurance carriers. In November 2006, the CMS     19     announced reductions to the 2007 reimbursement levels for bone density assessments, CAD, breast biopsy and digital and analog mammography screening and diagnostics. The most significant reductions were an approximately 40% decline in 2007 in reimbursement for osteoporosis (DXA) testing, which increases to an approximately 70% decline over 4 years, an approximately 30% decline in 2007 in reimbursement for stereotactic biopsy, which increases to an approximately 63% decline over 4 years, an approximately 16% decline in reimbursement for CAD in 2007, which increases to an approximately 50% decline over four years, and an approximately 10% decline in 2007 in reimbursement for vacuum assisted (Suros) biopsy, which increases to an approximately 15% decline over 4 years. These reductions or any other reduction or other adverse change in reimbursement policies for the use of our products could harm our business and prospects.    If we fail to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our direct radiography products require, we will not be successful in developing and marketing those products.    The manufacture of our direct radiography detectors is highly complex and requires precise high quality manufacturing that is difficult to achieve. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing these detectors in commercial quantities, primarily related to delays and difficulties in obtaining critical components for these detectors that meet our high manufacturing standards. Our initial difficulties have led to increased delivery lead-times and increased costs of manufacturing these products. Our failure, including the failure of our contract manufacturers, to achieve and maintain the required high manufacturing standards could result in further delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns, product recalls or withdrawals, or other problems that could harm our business and prospects.    Interruptions, delays, shutdowns or damage at our manufacturing facilities could harm our business.    We manufacture our products at our manufacturing facilities in Danbury, Connecticut, Bedford, Massachusetts, Newark, Delaware, and, with our recent acquisition of AEG, we manufacture the selenium coatings used in the digital x-ray image capture radiographic systems in Germany. We also manufacture selenium and organic photoconductor coatings for other uses in Germany and China. An interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods or weather conditions. We may experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failures, loss of power, gray outs, delays in deliveries or extensive damage to any of our facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, our AEG manufacturing operations in Germany and China are subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations.    The uncertainty of healthcare reform could harm our business and prospects.    In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including efforts at national healthcare reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare, consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office-based healthcare practitioners. Healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the United States and in many foreign countries could:        •   limit the use of our products;        •   reduce reimbursement available for such use; or        •   adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted.    These reforms or cost containment measures, including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect, could harm our business and prospects and make it difficult for us to raise additional capital on advantageous terms, if at all.    20    Our success depends on new product development.    We have a continuing research and development program designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve our products. We are expending significant resources on the development of digital x-ray imaging products, including the development of a digital mammography product to perform breast tomosynthesis, a 3-dimensional imaging technique. The successful development of these products and product enhancements are subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:        •   unanticipated delays;        •   access to capital;        •   budget overruns;        •   technical problems; and        •   other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design, development and commercialization of these new products, including, for example, changes requested by the FDA in connection with pre-market approval applications for our products or 510(k) notification.    Given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction, we cannot assure that any of our product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget, if at all. Our failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget could harm our business and prospects.    Our business could be harmed if our products contain undetected errors or defects or do not meet customer specifications.    We are continuously developing new products and improving our existing products. Newly introduced products can contain undetected errors or defects. In addition, these products may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications. If, despite our internal testing and testing by our customers, any of our products contain errors or defects or any of our products fail to meet customer specifications, then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies. We may not be able to do so on a timely basis, if at all, and may only be able to do so at considerable expense. In addition, any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction, negative publicity or legal claims and could harm our business and prospects.    Any new products or product enhancements developed by us may not be commercially successful.    Even if we are successful in developing a new product or a product enhancement, we cannot assure that such product or product enhancement will be commercially successful. The successful commercialization of new products and product enhancements are subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:        •   uncertainty of the development of a market for such product or enhancement;        •   product performance, perceived or actual;        •   competition; and        •   other technological developments,    as well as the other risks relating to our business as set forth herein. Often, the development of a significant market for a new product or product enhancement will depend upon the establishment of a reimbursement code or an advantageous reimbursement level for use of the product. Moreover, even if addressed, such reimbursement codes or levels frequently are not addressed until after a new product or product enhancement is developed and commercially introduced, which can delay the successful commercialization of a new product or product enhancement.    21    Our reliance on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products could harm our business and prospects.    We rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products. In particular, we have a limited number of suppliers for the panel for our direct radiography products and AEG is our sole source provider for Selenium coatings. In addition, we have only limited sources of supply for some key components used in our mini C-arm systems and our Suros biopsy systems. Obtaining alternative sources of supply of these components could involve significant delays and other costs, and may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. The failure of a component supplier or contract assembler to provide acceptable quality and timely components or assembly service at an acceptable price, or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could harm our business and prospects. Any disruption of supplies of key components could delay or reduce shipments, which could result in lost or deferred sales.    Our liquidity and financial position could be harmed by our obligations under our credit facility and our long-term leases for our headquarters and Lorad facilities.    Our obligations under our credit facility and our long-term leases for our headquarters and Lorad facilities could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, working capital or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. These obligations could also adversely affect our liquidity and, in the event of a cash shortfall, we could be forced to reduce other expenditures to be able to meet such requirements. Moreover, our credit facility and long-term leases contain financial and other covenants. If we do not comply with our covenants our obligations could be accelerated and our liquidity and financial position could be harmed. Our ability to meet our obligations under our credit facility and leases will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and make our lease payments, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of such obligations, or obtain additional financing and our liquidity and financial position could be harmed.    We may not be able to compete successfully.    A number of companies have developed, or are expected to develop, products that compete or will compete with our products. Many of these competitors offer a range of products in areas other than those in which we compete, which may make such competitors more attractive to hospitals, radiology clients, general purchasing organizations and other potential customers. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors such as Agfa, Fuji, GE, Kodak, Johnson and Johnson, Siemens and Toshiba, are larger and have greater financial resources than us and offer a range of products broader than our products. Some of the companies with which we now compete or may compete in the future have or may have more extensive research, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and significantly greater technical and personnel resources than us, and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry. Our failure to compete successfully could harm our business and prospects.    Recent proposed changes to reclassify full field digital mammography to permit 510(k) clearance could increase competition for our digital mammography products.    On May 23, 2006 the US FDA Radiological Devices Panel recommended the reclassification of full field digital mammography systems from Class III to Class II devices. The FDA has not taken any additional steps act on the panel’s recommendation. If the FDA implements the panel’s recommendation, the reclassification would allow full field digital mammography systems to be cleared for commercialization through the 510(k) process, which is less rigorous than the present pre-market approval process. If and when implemented, the reclassification for full field digital mammography systems from Class III to Class II devices may lower barriers of entry into the digital mammography market, may result in more competitors entering the United States market and could harm sales of our digital mammography systems.    22    Our success depends upon our ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements.    The market for our products has been characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements. We believe that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to enhance our existing products, successfully develop new products that meet increasing customer requirements and gain market acceptance. If we fail to do so our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology.    Our failure to manage current or future alliances or joint ventures effectively may harm our business and prospects.    We have entered into strategic alliances with Siemens and Esaote. We are also exploring other potential alliances, joint ventures or other business relationships. Siemens and Esaote compete with us in some of our business segments, and are competitors or potential competitors to some of our customers or potential customers. Our alliance with Siemens, Esaote or any other person could enhance their business to our detriment or make it more difficult for us to enter into advantageous business transactions or relationships with others. Moreover, we may not be able to:        •   identify appropriate candidates for alliances or joint ventures;        •   assure that any alliance or joint venture candidate will provide us with the support anticipated;        •   successfully negotiate an alliance or joint venture on terms that are advantageous to us; or        •   successfully manage any alliance or joint venture.    Furthermore, any alliance or joint venture may divert management time and resources. Entering into a disadvantageous alliance or joint venture or failing to manage an alliance or joint venture effectively could harm our business and prospects.    The future growth of our bone densitometry business depends in large part on the continued development and more widespread acceptance of complementary therapies as well as our ability to expand into the primary care market.    Our bone densitometers and related products are used to assist physicians in diagnosing patients at risk for osteoporosis and other bone disorders, and to monitor the effectiveness of therapies to treat these disorders. As a result, the future growth of the market for these products and of this business will in large part be dependent upon the development and more widespread acceptance of drug therapies to prevent and to treat osteoporosis, and in addition, our ability to expand into the primary care market. Over the last several years, the FDA has approved a number of drug therapies to treat osteoporosis. We also understand that a number of other drug therapies are under development. While sales of our bone densitometry products have benefited from the increased availability and use of these therapies, most patients who are at risk for osteoporosis continue to go untreated. We cannot assure that any therapies under development or in clinical trials will prove to be effective, obtain regulatory approval, or that any approved therapy will gain widespread acceptance, or that we will be able to expand into the primary care market. Even if these therapies gain widespread acceptance, we cannot assure that this acceptance will increase the sales of our products.    Reductions in revenues could harm our operating results because a high percentage of our operating expenses is relatively fixed.    A high percentage of our operating expenses is relatively fixed. We likely will not be able to reduce spending to compensate for adverse fluctuations in revenues. As a result, shortfalls in revenues are likely to harm our operating results.    23    Our results of operations are subject to significant quarterly variation and seasonal fluctuation.    Our results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation. The results for a particular quarter may vary due to a number of factors, including:        •   the overall state of healthcare and cost containment efforts        •   reimbursement levels for the use of our products;        •   the development status and demand for our products;        •   the development status and demand for therapies to treat breast cancer and osteoporosis;        •   economic conditions in our markets;        •   foreign exchange rates;        •   the timing of orders;        •   the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales;        •   the mix of products we sell;        •   the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors; and        •   pricing and other competitive conditions.    Customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments. Production difficulties could also delay shipments. Any of these factors also could harm our business and prospects.    Our delay or inability to obtain any necessary United States or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our products could harm our business and prospects.    Our products are medical devices that are the subject of a high level of regulatory oversight. Our delay or inability to obtain any necessary United States or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our products could harm our business and prospects. The process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time-consuming. There is a risk that any approvals or clearances, once obtained, may be withdrawn or modified. Medical devices cannot be marketed in the United States without clearance or approval by the FDA. Medical devices sold in the United States must also be manufactured in compliance with FDA Good Manufacturing Practices, which regulate the design, manufacture, packing, storage and installation of medical devices. Moreover, medical devices are required to comply with FDA regulations relating to investigational research and labeling. States may also regulate the manufacture, sale and use of medical devices, particularly those that employ x-ray technology. Our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies.    Fluctuations in the exchange rates of European currencies and the other foreign currencies in which we conduct our business, in relation to the U.S. dollar, have harmed and could continue to harm our business and prospects.    Foreign sales accounted for approximately 28% of our product sales in fiscal 2006, 33% of our product sales in fiscal 2005, and 39% of our product sales in fiscal 2004. We maintain a sales and service office in Belgium and a support office in France, and our AEG Elektrofotografie subsidiary conducts its business worldwide, with headquarters in Germany and manufacturing operations in Germany and China. The expenses of these offices are denominated in local currencies, and our foreign sales may be denominated in local currencies, the Euro or U.S. dollars. We anticipate that foreign sales and sales denominated in foreign currencies will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales. Fluctuations in the value of local currencies have caused, and are likely to continue to cause, amounts translated into U.S. dollars to fluctuate in comparison with previous periods. We have hedged our foreign currency exposure by borrowing funds in local European currencies to pay the expenses of our foreign offices. In addition, our recently acquired AEG operation has engaged in hedging activities, such as currency swaps, to hedge its foreign currency exposure. There is a risk that any hedging activities will not be successful in mitigating our foreign exchange risk exposure.    24    We conduct our business worldwide, which exposes us to a number of difficulties in coordinating our international activities and dealing with multiple regulatory environments.    We sell our products to customers throughout the world. Our worldwide business may be harmed by:        •   difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations;        •   greater difficulties in trade accounts receivable collection;        •   possible adverse tax consequences;        •   governmental currency controls;        •   changes in various regulatory requirements;        •   political and economic changes and disruptions;        •   export/import controls; and        •   tariff regulations.    Additionally, as a result of our acquisition of AEG Elektrofotografie, which also conducts its business worldwide, with headquarters in Germany and manufacturing operations in Germany, China and the United States, we may experience increased difficulties in coordinating international activities and successfully integrating and operating AEG Elektrofotografie’s business.    Our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology.    We rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our technology. Despite these precautions, unauthorized third parties may infringe, copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology. We do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought, if at all, or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated. In addition, we have obtained or applied for corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign countries for some of our patents and patent applications. There is a risk that these patent applications will not be granted or that the patent or patent application will not provide significant protection for our products and technology. Our competitors may independently develop similar technology that our patents do not cover. In addition, because patent applications in the United States are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued, applications may have been filed which relate to our technology. Moreover, there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States intellectual property laws. In the absence of significant patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, processes or technology.    Our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.    There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and related industries. We are and have been engaged, and may be in the future, notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties. In connection with such litigation or if any claims are asserted against our intellectual property rights, we may seek to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. There is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms. Alternatively, we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology. These actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. As a result, any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims, whether or not proven to be true, may harm our business and prospects.    Our future success will depend on the continued services of our key personnel.    The loss of any of our key personnel, particularly our key research and development personnel, could harm our business and prospects. Our success will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified     25     managerial and technical personnel. Competition for such personnel, particularly software engineers and other technical personnel, is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business. We do not have any key man life insurance for any of our officers or other key personnel.    We are exposed to potential risks and we will continue to incur increased costs as a result of the internal control testing and evaluation process mandated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.    We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006 and assessed all deficiencies on both an individual basis and in combination to determine if, when aggregated, they constitute a material weakness. As a result of this evaluation, no material weaknesses were identified. Although we have completed the documentation and testing of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for fiscal 2006, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we expect to continue to incur costs, including increased accounting fees and increased staffing levels, in order to maintain compliance with that section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We continue to monitor controls for any weaknesses or deficiencies. No evaluation can provide complete assurance that our internal controls will detect or uncover all failures of persons within the company to disclose material information otherwise required to be reported. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures could also be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments. In addition, as we continue to expand globally, the challenges involved in implementing appropriate internal controls will increase and will require that we continue to improve our internal controls.    In the future, if we fail to complete the Sarbanes-Oxley 404 evaluation in a timely manner, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot attest in a timely manner to our evaluation, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls. In addition, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.    Our assessment of internal controls in fiscal 2006 did not include our recently acquired entities of AEG, R2 and Suros. Our assessment of internal controls in fiscal 2007 will include these entities. We expect that these and future acquisitions of companies, some of which have operations outside the United States, will provide us with additional challenges in implementing the required processes, procedures and controls in our acquired operations. Our recently acquired companies do not have disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are as thorough or effective as those required by securities law applicable to public companies in the United States. Although we intend to devote substantial time and incur substantial costs, as necessary, to ensure ongoing compliance, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in complying with Section 404.    There is a risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to protect us from product liability or other claims, or that in the future liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all.    Our business involves the risk of product liability and other claims inherent to the medical device business. We maintain product liability insurance subject to deductibles and exclusions. There is a risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to protect the company from product and other liability claims, or that product liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. An under-insured or uninsured claim could harm our operating results or financial condition.    We use hazardous materials and products.    Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, such as toxic and carcinogenic chemicals and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state and local regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of this type of accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any such liability     26     could be extensive. We are also subject to substantial regulation relating to occupational health and safety, environmental protection, hazardous substance control, and waste management and disposal. The failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to, among other things, fines and criminal liability.    Risks relating to our common stock    Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our stockholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.    Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the provisions of Delaware corporate law include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control. In addition, we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control. These provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock.    Our stock price is volatile.    The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. We believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:        •   announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, including changes in reimbursement rates, proposed and completed acquisitions, or the industry in which we compete;        •   quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels;        •   general conditions in the worldwide economy;        •   announcements of technological innovations;        •   new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;        •   developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; and        •   developments in relationships with our customers and suppliers.    In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “high-tech” companies, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may decline.    Future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.    Substantially all of our outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradable without restriction or registration. Affiliates must sell all shares they own in compliance with the volume and other requirements of Rule 144, except for the holding period requirements. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our stockholders, or even the potential for such sales, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities.
