Item 1A. Risk Factors  This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our objectives, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.  Risks Related to our Indebtedness  We incurred significant indebtedness in order to finance the merger with Cytyc Corporation, which limits our operating flexibility, and could adversely affect our operations and financial results and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.  In order to finance the cash portion of the merger with Cytyc Corporation (“Cytyc”) and other expenses incurred in connection with the merger, we incurred over $2.35 billion of new indebtedness, including approximately $600 million under a senior secured tranche A term loan facility which matures on September 30, 2012, $500 million under a senior secured tranche B-1 and B-2 term loan facility which matures on March 31, 2013, and $1.25 billion under senior secured capital markets term loan facility which matures on April 22, 2009. Additionally, certain other of our indebtedness may remain outstanding. These credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. This level of indebtedness may:        •    make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;        •    increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates;        •    require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes;        •    limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;        •    place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and        •    limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes or acquisitions.  In addition, the terms of our financing obligations contain covenants that restrict our ability, and that of our subsidiaries, to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, including, among other things, limitations on the ability to:        •    incur additional indebtedness;        •    pay dividends and make distributions;        •    repurchase stock;        •    make certain investments;        •    create liens;        •    engage in transactions with affiliates;        •    merge with or acquire another company; and        •    transfer and sell assets.  Our new credit facilities also require us to satisfy certain financial covenants.    22    Table of Contents Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, political decisions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the new credit facilities, including financial covenants, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.  If there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments or a change of control, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately and may be cross-defaulted to other debt. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities.  We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our obligations, including our obligations under our credit facilities.  Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures, strategic transactions and expansion efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  Our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and we cannot assure that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as such indebtedness matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. If this is the case, we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may need to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing. These financing strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, will depend on, among other things, our financial condition at the time, restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness, and other factors, including the condition of the financial markets and the markets in which we compete.  If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and additional borrowings, refinancings or proceeds of asset sales are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations.  We may be required to enter into hedging transactions for our variable interest rate exposure under our existing credit facilities which could adversely affect our ability to repay all or a portion of those facilities without incurring additional costs, and will subject us to risks of default by the counterparties to those transactions.  The terms of our credit facility obligate us to enter into hedging transactions to hedge a substantial portion of the interest rate risk under those facilities, if we do not otherwise refinance a substantial portion of those facilities with debt bearing a fixed rate of interest. If we repay, redeem or repurchase (voluntarily or mandatorily) all or a portion of our credit facilities prior to their scheduled maturities, our obligations under those hedging transactions, if any, may cease to match our obligations under the credit facilities, and could result in significant additional expense to the company. These hedging transactions may not qualify for effective hedge treatment in accordance with U.S. GAAP and as a result, any changes in fair value of hedge contracts could be required to be recorded to the statement of income. In addition, default by the counterparties to our hedging transactions could result in us having to make interest payments at the variable rates payable under the credit facilities and expose us further to interest rate fluctuation risk under those credit facilities.    23    Table of Contents Risks Related to our Business  Sales and market acceptance of our products is dependent on third party reimbursement. Failure of third party payors to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for use of our products could harm our business and prospects.  Sales and market acceptance of our medical products in the United States and other countries is dependent on the reimbursement of patient’s medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. The costs of our products to customers are substantial, and market acceptance of our products will continue to depend upon our customers’ ability to obtain an appropriate level of reimbursement from third-party payors for use of such products. In the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, known as CMS, establish guidelines for the reimbursement of healthcare providers treating Medicare and Medicaid patients. Under current CMS guidelines, varying reimbursement levels have been established for our products and procedures. The actual reimbursement amounts are determined by individual state Medicare carriers and, for non-Medicare and Medicaid patients, private insurance carriers. There are often delays between the reimbursement approvals by CMS and by a state Medicare carrier and private insurance carriers. Moreover, states as well as private insurance carriers may choose not to follow the CMS reimbursement guidelines. The use of our products outside the United States is similarly affected by reimbursement policies adopted by foreign governments’ reimbursements and regulatory positions and insurance carriers.  In November 2007, the CMS announced reductions to the 2008 reimbursement levels for physician, hospital and ambulatory surgical center payments. Such reimbursement rates also reflect a Sustainable Growth Rate (“SGR”) reduction which requires that reimbursement rates factor in a 10.1% reduction in physician payments under the physician fee schedule as determined by the SGR formula. The most significant reductions for 2008 applicable to our products were an approximately 4% to 9% decline in digital and analog mammography screening and diagnostic reimbursement rates, primarily due to the 10.1% SGR reduction and an approximately 22% decline, in addition to the SGR reduction, in reimbursement for CAD in 2008, the second year of the increases to an approximately 50% decline over four years as announced in 2006. Medicare payments in 2008 for our other products are effected primarily by the SGR reduction, and will decline by less than approximately 12%,while in-office payments for NovaSure and MammoSite balloon catheter placement will decline by approximately 17%. In November 2006, CMS announced reductions to the 2007 reimbursement levels for bone density assessments including an approximately 40% decline in 2007 in reimbursement for osteoporosis (DXA) testing, which increases to an approximately 70% decline over four years. The increase in the decline for 2008 for reimbursement for DXA testing is approximately 2%. These reductions or any other reduction or adverse change in reimbursement policies for the use of our products could harm our business and prospects.  Our business may be harmed by our recently completed acquisitions and our merger with Cytyc.  We recently acquired a number of businesses, technologies, product lines, and products, including Cytyc, BioLucent, Suros, R2, AEG, Adeza and Adiana. The success of these acquisitions will depend on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquired businesses with our business. We may fail to realize these anticipated benefits for a number of reasons, including the following:        •    problems may arise with our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses, which may result in us not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected, and may include:        •    diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration or inadequate management resources available for integration activity and oversight;        •    failure to retain and motivate key employees;        •    failure to successfully manage relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers;        •    failure of customers to accept new products;    24    Table of Contents     •    failure to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts;        •    failure to combine product offerings and product lines quickly and effectively;        •    failure to effectively enhance acquired technology and products or develop new products relating to the acquired businesses;        •    potential difficulties and inefficiencies in managing and operating businesses in multiple locations or operating businesses in which we have either limited or no direct experience;        •    potential difficulties integrating financial reporting systems;        •    potential difficulties in the timely filing of required reports with the SEC; and        •    potential difficulties in implementing controls, procedures and policies, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, appropriate for a larger public company at companies that, prior to the acquisition of such companies, had lacked such controls, procedures and policies, which may result in ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting;        •    we may not be able to achieve the expected synergies from an acquisition or it may take longer than expected to achieve those synergies;        •    an acquisition may result in future impairment charges related to diminished fair value of businesses acquired as compared to the price we paid for them;        •    an acquisition may involve restructuring operations or reductions in workforce which may result in substantial charges to our operations;        •    an acquisition may involve unexpected costs or liabilities, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from our expectations; and        •    the acquired businesses may be adversely affected by future legislative, regulatory, or tax decisions and/or changes as well as other economic, business and/or competitive factors.  Our acquisition of AEG, which conducts its business worldwide, with headquarters in Germany and manufacturing operations in Germany and China, is also subject to the additional challenges and risks associated with volatility in the market for organic photoconductor coatings used for laser printer cartridges, and our international operations, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risk and the particular economic, legal, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.  Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquired businesses could harm our business and prospects and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  The current levels of growth in the markets for our direct-to-digital full-field mammography products and endometrial ablation procedures, such as our NovaSure System, may not continue to develop as expected or be indicative of future growth.  Demand for newly introduced technologies or treatments can initially be exaggerated as supply increases to meet pre-existing demand. However, once the pre-existing demand is met, growth in the market may abruptly stop or significantly slow. The markets for our direct-to-digital full-field mammography products and endometrial ablation procedures, such as our NovaSure System, may not continue to develop as current levels of growth and demand may indicate and we cannot predict when, or at what rate, this demand may stop or decline in growth.    25    Table of Contents There is a significant installed base of conventional screen-film mammography products in hospitals and radiological practices. The use of our direct-to-digital mammography products in many cases would require these potential customers to replace their existing x-ray imaging equipment. Moreover, as digital mammography products are generally more expensive than conventional screen-film mammography products, we believe that a major factor in the market’s acceptance of digital mammography products has been and will continue to be based upon the benefits of digital technology as compared to less expensive technologies. As a result, the market for our digital mammography products has and will continue to be affected by published studies and reports relating to the comparative efficacy of digital mammography products. The publication of an adverse study could significantly impair the adoption of this technology and harm our business. Similarly, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in continuing to attract physicians and women to use the NovaSure System, or whether or not evolving trends in the treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding will favor new endometrial ablation procedures as compared to traditional approaches.  If the demand for our direct-to-digital mammography products and treatments like the NovaSure System were to stop abruptly or begin to decline, our operating results and profitability could be adversely affected.  The success of our ThinPrep System depends upon the cost and continued market acceptance of our ThinPrep System products.  The success of our ThinPrep System depends on the continued market acceptance of our ThinPrep System and ThinPrep Imaging System, including any follow-on applications of ThinPrep technology. The laboratory cost of using the ThinPrep System and ThinPrep Imaging System for cervical cancer screening, both together and individually, is higher than that of a conventional Pap smear and, we believe, competing liquid-based slide preparation systems. Due in part to increased competitive pressures in the cytology screening market and healthcare industry to reduce costs, our ability to continue to gain market acceptance of the ThinPrep System and follow-on products will depend on our ability to demonstrate that the higher cost of using the ThinPrep System is offset by (i) a reduction in costs often associated with conventional Pap smears or competing liquid-based slide preparation systems, such as inaccurate diagnoses and the need for repeat Pap smears, as well as (ii) the ability to conduct additional testing, such as testing for the HPV, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea on samples collected in a ThinPrep vial of preservative. In particular, for the ThinPrep Imaging System, we will need to work with healthcare providers, insurance companies and other third-party payors, and clinical laboratories to reinforce the known clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the ThinPrep Imaging System.  We are dependent upon a relatively small number of large clinical laboratory customers in the United States for a significant portion of our sales of the ThinPrep System.  We are dependent upon a relatively small number of large clinical laboratory customers in the United States for a significant portion of our sales of the ThinPrep System. Due in part to a trend toward consolidation of clinical laboratories in recent years and the relative size of the largest United States laboratories, it is likely that a significant portion of ThinPrep System sales will continue to be concentrated among a relatively small number of large clinical laboratories. Our business and prospects may be harmed if we are unable to increase sales to, or maintain pricing levels with our existing customers and establish new customers both within and outside the United States.  Our success will depend on new product development.  We have continuing research and development programs designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve our products. We are expending significant resources on the development of digital x-ray imaging products, including the development of a digital mammography product to perform breast tomosynthesis, a 3-dimensional imaging technique as well as on continued product line enhancements. The successful development of our products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:        •    unanticipated delays;    26    Table of Contents     •    access to capital;        •    budget overruns;        •    third party intellectual property;        •    technical problems; and        •    other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design, development and commercialization of these new products, including, for example, changes requested by the FDA in connection with pre-market approval applications for products or 510(k) notification.  Given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction, there can be no assurance that any of our product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget, if at all. Our failure to develop new products and product enhancements, such as our digital mammography tomosynthesis product, on a timely basis or within budget could harm our business and prospects and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  The markets for and future growth of our products and treatments may not develop as expected.  There can be no assurance that our existing products or treatments, or the enhancement of products or treatments will be commercially successful. The successful commercialization of our products and treatments are subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:        •    uncertainty of the development of a market for such product or treatment;        •    trends relating to, or the introduction or existence of, competing products, technologies or alternative treatments or therapies that may be more effective, safer or easier to use than our products, technologies, treatments or therapies;        •    perceptions of our products or treatments as compared to other products and treatments;        •    recommendation and support for the use of our products or treatments by influential customers, such as hospitals, radiological practices, breast surgeons and radiation oncologists and treatment centers;        •    the availability and extent of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of our products or treatments;        •    competition, including the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories, more recognizable names and more established distribution networks; and        •    other technological developments.  Often, the development of a significant market for a product or treatment will depend upon the establishment of a reimbursement code or an advantageous reimbursement level for use of the product or treatment. Moreover, even if addressed, such reimbursement codes or levels frequently are not addressed until after a product or treatment is developed and commercially introduced, which can delay the successful commercialization of a product or treatment. If we are unable to successfully commercialize and create a significant market for our products and treatments, such as our digital mammography tomosynthesis product, due to, among other things, the lack of reimbursement codes or disadvantageous reimbursement levels for such products or treatments, our business and prospects could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.  We may not be successful in growing our international sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  We cannot guarantee that we will successfully continue to develop international sales channels or capabilities that will enable us to generate significant revenue from international sales. We may not be able to obtain favorable third-party reimbursements and required regulatory approvals in foreign countries. Failure to continue to increase international sales could harm our business and prospects.    27    Table of Contents Our success depends on our ability to manage growth effectively.  Our operations and facilities, including the number of employees and the geographic area of operations, have grown rapidly, and our operations and facilities are expected to continue to grow. Our failure to manage growth effectively could harm our business and prospects. Such growth may significantly strain our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. To manage such growth effectively, it is expected that we will continue to implement and improve additional management and financial systems and controls, and to effectively retain, expand, train and manage our employee base.  Our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.  There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and related industries. We have been involved in infringement litigation, and may in the future be notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties.  For example, in October 2007, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson operating company (“Ethicon”), filed a complaint against us and our wholly-owned subsidiary Suros. The complaint alleges that certain of the ATEC biopsy systems manufactured and sold by Suros infringe four Ethicon patents. The complaint seeks to enjoin us and Suros from infringing the patents as well as the recovery of damages and costs resulting from the alleged infringement.  In connection with litigation or if any claims are asserted against our intellectual property rights, we may seek to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. There is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms. Alternatively, we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology. These actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. As a result, any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims, whether or not proven to be true, may harm our business and prospects.  If we fail to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our direct radiography products require, we may not be successful in developing and marketing those products.  The manufacture of our direct radiography detectors is highly complex and requires precise high quality manufacturing that is difficult to achieve. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing these detectors in sufficient quantities, primarily related to delays and difficulties in obtaining critical components for these detectors that meet our high manufacturing standards. Our initial difficulties led to increased delivery lead-times and increased costs of manufacturing these products. Our failure, including the failure of our contract manufacturers, to achieve and maintain the required high manufacturing standards could result in further delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns, product recalls or withdrawals, increased warranty costs or other problems that could harm our business and prospects.  The uncertainty of healthcare reform could harm our business and prospects.  In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including efforts at national healthcare reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare, consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office-based healthcare practitioners. Healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the United States and in many foreign countries could:        •    limit the use of our products;        •    reduce reimbursement available for such use; or        •    adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted.  These reforms or cost containment measures, including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect, could harm our business and prospects.    28    Table of Contents Our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology.  We have relied primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our products and technology. Despite these precautions, unauthorized third parties may infringe, copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology. We do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought, if at all, or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated. In addition, we have obtained or applied for corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign countries for some of our patents and patent applications. There is a risk that these patent applications will not be granted or that the patent or patent application will not provide significant protection for our products and technology. Our competitors may independently develop similar technology that our patents do not cover. In addition, because patent applications in the United States are not generally publicly disclosed until eighteen months after the application is filed, applications may have been filed by third parties which relate to our technology. Moreover, there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States intellectual property laws. In the absence of significant patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, processes or technology.  Our international operations expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face.  We are subject to a number of additional risks and expenses due to our international operations. Any of these risks or expenses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. These risks and expenses include:        •    difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences;        •    protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;        •    greater difficulties in trade accounts receivable collection;        •    difficulties and expenses related to implementing internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;        •    expenses associated with customizing products for clients in foreign countries;        •    possible adverse tax consequences;        •    governmental currency controls;        •    multiple, conflicting and changing government laws and regulations (including, among other things, antitrust and tax requirements, international trade regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act);        •    reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;        •    political and economic changes and disruptions;        •    export/import controls; and        •    tariff regulations.  Interruptions, delays, shutdowns or damage at our manufacturing facilities could harm our business.  We manufacture most of our mammography, breastcare and osteoporosis assessment products as well as our mini C-arm products and MRI systems at our manufacturing facilities in Danbury, Connecticut, Bedford, Massachusetts, Indianapolis, Indiana and Newark, Delaware. In addition, we manufacture the selenium coatings used in the digital x-ray image capture radiographic systems in Germany and our selenium and organic photoconductor coatings for other uses in Germany and China. We assemble and manufacture our ThinPrep products at our facilities in Marlborough, Massachusetts and Londonderry, New Hampshire. In addition, we     29    Table of Contents  manufacture our NovaSure System and MammoSite System in Costa Rica. An interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods or weather conditions. Our manufacturing facilities may experience plant shutdowns, strikes or other labor disruptions, or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failures, loss of power, gray outs, delays in deliveries or extensive damage to any of our facilities, which could harm our business and prospects. Because some of our manufacturing operations are located in Germany, China and Costa Rica, those manufacturing operations are also subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations described below.  Our business could be harmed if products contain undetected errors or defects or do not meet customer specifications.  We are continuously developing new products and improving our existing products. Newly introduced products can contain undetected errors or defects. In addition, these products may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications. If, despite internal testing and testing by customers, any of our products contain errors or defects or fail to meet customer specifications, then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies. We may not be able to do so on a timely basis, if at all, and may only be able to do so at considerable expense. In addition, any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction, negative publicity, mandatory or voluntary recall or legal claims and could harm our business and prospects.  We rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products. This reliance could harm our business and prospects.  We rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products. In particular, we have a limited number of suppliers for certain components of our digital detector. In addition, we have only limited sources of supply for some key components used in our mini C-arm systems and our Suros biopsy systems. We currently obtain certain key components of our products, including the proprietary filter material and microscope slides used in the ThinPrep Pap Test, radioisotopes, certain balloons and other items used in the design and manufacture of the MammoSite System and the Iotrex liquid isotope used with the GliaSite System, from single or a limited number of sources due to technology, availability, price, quality and other considerations. Additionally, the NovaSure System utilizes several components that may become obsolete or no longer be manufactured.  Obtaining alternative sources of supply of these components could involve significant delays and other costs and regulatory challenges, and may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. The failure of a component supplier or contract assembler to provide sufficient quantities, acceptable quality and timely components or assembly service at an acceptable price, or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could harm our business and prospects. Any disruption of supplies of key components could delay or reduce shipments, which could result in lost or deferred sales.  We face intense competition from other companies and may not be able to compete successfully.  A number of companies have developed, or are expected to develop, products that compete or will compete with our products. Some of our competitors are large companies that may enjoy significant competitive advantages over us, including:        •    significantly greater name recognition;        •    established distribution networks;        •    additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives to gain competitive advantage;    30    Table of Contents     •    more extensive research, development, sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities; and        •    better positioning to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry.  The markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and may be significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Other companies may develop products that are superior to or less expensive, or both, than our products. Improvements in existing competitive products or the introductions of new competitive products may reduce our ability to compete for sales, particularly if those competitive products demonstrate better safety or effectiveness, clinical results, ease of use or lower costs.  If we are unable to compete effectively against existing and future competitors and existing and future alternative treatments, our business and prospects could be harmed.  Our success depends upon our ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements.  The markets for our products have been characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements. These trends will likely continue into the foreseeable future. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to enhance our existing products, successfully develop new products that meet increasing customer requirements and gain market acceptance. If we fail to do so our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology.  Our results of operations is subject to significant quarterly variation and seasonal fluctuation.  Our results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation. Our results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including:        •    the overall state of healthcare and cost containment efforts;        •    the timing and level of reimbursement for our products domestically and internationally;        •    the development status and demand for our products;        •    the development status and demand for therapies to treat breast cancer and osteoporosis;        •    economic conditions in our markets;        •    foreign exchange rates;        •    the timing of orders;        •    the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales;        •    the mix of products we sell;        •    the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors;        •    pricing and other competitive conditions;        •    unanticipated expenses; and        •    complex revenue recognition rules pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP).  Customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments. Production difficulties could also delay shipments. Any of these factors also could harm our business and prospects.  Our delay or inability to obtain any necessary United States or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our products could harm our business and prospects.  Our products are medical devices that are the subject of a high level of regulatory oversight. Our delay or inability to obtain any necessary United States or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our products,     31    Table of Contents  such as our digital mammography tomosynthesis product and our permanent female contraception product, could harm our business and prospects and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time-consuming. There is a risk that any approvals or clearances, once obtained, may be withdrawn or modified.  Medical devices cannot be marketed in the United States without clearance or approval by the FDA. Any modifications to a device that has received a pre-market approval that affect its safety or effectiveness require a pre-market approval supplement or possibly a separate pre-market approval, either of which is likely to be time-consuming, expensive and uncertain to obtain. If the FDA requires us to seek one or more pre-market approval supplements or new pre-market approvals for any modification to a previously approved device, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified device until we obtain approval, and we may be subject to significant criminal and/or civic sanctions, including but not limited to, regulatory fines or penalties.  Medical devices sold in the United States must also be manufactured in compliance with FDA Good Manufacturing Practices, which regulate the design, manufacture, packing, storage and installation of medical devices. Moreover, medical devices are required to comply with FDA regulations relating to investigational research and labeling. States may also regulate the manufacture, sale and use of medical devices, particularly those that employ x-ray technology. Our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies.  Recent proposed changes to reclassify full-field digital mammography to permit 510(k) clearance could increase competition for our digital mammography products.  On May 23, 2006 the FDA Radiological Devices Panel recommended the reclassification of full-field digital mammography systems from Class III to Class II devices. The FDA has indicated that they intend to issue guidance on full field digital mammography during 2008. If the FDA implements the panel’s recommendation, the reclassification would allow full-field digital mammography systems to be cleared for commercialization through the 510(k) process, which is less rigorous than the present pre-market approval process. If and when implemented, the reclassification for full-field digital mammography systems from Class III to Class II devices may lower barriers of entry into the digital mammography market, may result in more competitors entering the United States market and could harm sales of our digital mammography systems.  Our products may be subject to recalls even after receiving FDA clearance or approval, which could harm our business and prospects.  The FDA and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of medical products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall could harm the reputation of our products and adversely affect our business and prospects.  Some of our activities may subject us to risks under federal and state laws prohibiting “kickbacks” and false or fraudulent claims.  We are subject to the provisions of a federal law commonly known as the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law, and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. While the federal law applies only to referrals, products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws often apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, with hospitals, physicians, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other     32    Table of Contents  third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties (including fines) for noncompliance that can be substantial. While we continually strive to comply with these complex requirements, interpretations of the applicability of these laws to marketing practices is ever evolving and even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and prospects.  We are subject to the risk of product liability claims relating to our products.  Our business involves the risk of product liability and other claims inherent to the medical device business. If even one of our products is found to have caused or contributed to injuries or deaths, we could be held liable for substantial damages. We maintain product liability insurance subject to deductibles and exclusions. There is a risk that the insurance coverage will not be sufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims, or that product liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. An under-insured or uninsured claim could harm our business and prospects. In addition, claims could adversely affect the reputation of the related product, which could damage that product’s competitive position in the market.  The sale and use of one of our diagnostic products could also lead to the filing of product liability claims if someone were to allege that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect that resulted in the failure to detect a disorder for which it was being used to screen or caused injuries to a patient. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure additional coverage in the future. Also, even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could be time consuming and expensive to defend, which could result in a diversion of management’s attention from our business and could adversely affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products, and could harm our business and prospects.  We use hazardous materials and products.  Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, such as toxic and carcinogenic chemicals and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state and local regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of this type of accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any such liability could be extensive. We are also subject to substantial regulation relating to occupational health and safety, environmental protection, hazardous substance control, and waste management and disposal. The failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to, among other things, fines and criminal liability.  Fluctuations in the exchange rates of European currencies and the other foreign currencies in which we conduct our business, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could harm our business and prospects.  We maintain sales and service offices outside the United States, have manufacturing facilities in Germany, Costa Rica and China, and conduct business worldwide. The expenses of our international offices are denominated in local currencies, except at our Costa Rica subsidiary, where the majority of business is conducted in U.S. dollars, and our foreign sales may be denominated in local currencies, the Euro or U.S. dollars.  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency. We have historically hedged, and may in the future hedge, our foreign currency exposure by borrowing funds in local European currencies to pay the expenses of our foreign offices. In addition, our AEG operation has engaged in hedging activities, such as currency swaps, to hedge our foreign currency exposure. There is a risk that any hedging activities will not be successful in mitigating our foreign exchange risk exposure.    33    Table of Contents Our future success depends on the continued services of key personnel.  The loss of any of our key personnel, particularly key research and development personnel, could harm our business and prospects and could impede the achievement of our research and development, operational or strategic objectives. Our success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel. Competition for such personnel, particularly software engineers and other technical personnel, is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business.  Our business may be harmed by acquisitions we complete in the future.  Our identification of suitable acquisition candidates involves risks inherent in assessing the values, strengths, weaknesses, risks and profitability of acquisition candidates, including the effects of the possible acquisition on our business, diversion of our management’s attention and risks and costs associated with unanticipated problems or latent liabilities, such as litigation, investigations or inquiries in connection with acquisitions that we complete. If we are successful in pursuing future acquisitions, we will be required to expend significant funds, incur additional debt or issue additional securities, which may negatively affect our results of operations and be dilutive to our stockholders. If we spend significant funds or incur additional debt, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline, and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete. Should we acquire another business, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing business.  Our failure to manage current or future alliances or joint ventures effectively may harm our business and prospects.  We have entered into alliances, joint ventures or other business relationships. Alliances with certain partners or companies could make it more difficult for us to enter into advantageous business transactions or relationships with others. Moreover, we may not be able to:        •    identify appropriate candidates for alliances or joint ventures;        •    assure that any alliance or joint venture candidate will provide us with the support anticipated;        •    successfully negotiate an alliance or joint venture on terms that are advantageous to us; or        •    successfully manage any alliance or joint venture.  Furthermore, any alliance or joint venture may divert management time and resources. Entering into a disadvantageous alliance or joint venture, failing to manage an alliance or joint venture effectively, or failing to comply with obligations in connection therewith, could harm our business and prospects.  We are exposed to potential risks and will continue to incur significant costs as a result of the internal control testing and evaluation process mandated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2007 and assessed all deficiencies on both an individual basis and in combination to determine if, when aggregated, they constitute a material weakness. As a result of this evaluation, no material weaknesses were identified.  We expect to continue to incur significant costs, including increased accounting fees and increased staffing levels, in order to maintain compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We continue to monitor controls for any weaknesses or deficiencies. No evaluation can provide complete assurance that our internal controls will detect or uncover all failures of persons within the company to disclose material information     34    Table of Contents  otherwise required to be reported. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures could also be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments. In addition, as we continue to expand globally, the challenges involved in implementing appropriate internal controls will increase and will require that we continue to improve our internal controls over financial reporting.  In 2007, Cytyc acquired Adeza and Adiana and we completed the merger with Cytyc. We expect to include Cytyc, Adeza and Adiana in our assessment of internal control over financial reporting in fiscal 2008. We expect to face additional challenges in implementing the required processes, procedures and controls as a result of the merger and other acquired operations. Although we intend to devote substantial time and incur substantial costs, as necessary, to ensure ongoing compliance, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in complying with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  For example, in connection with Cytyc’s filing of their original Annual Report on Form 10-K in March 2007, its management included Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting therein, which expressed a conclusion by management that they believed that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006. As a result of the restatement of Cytyc’s consolidated financial statements, its management determined that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2006, and, subsequently concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2006.  A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The following material weakness in Cytyc’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 was identified and included in its assessment: Cytyc did not implement controls necessary to provide reasonable assurance that the accounting for certain stock option exercise activity that occurred during the period from 1996 through 2002 was properly recorded in its financial statements included in its 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as originally filed, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. To remedy the material weakness identified in the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, Cytyc enhanced its policies surrounding consultations on complex technical accounting matters to include third-party subject matter experts.  In the future, if we fail to complete the Sarbanes-Oxley 404 evaluation in a timely manner, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot attest in a timely manner to our evaluation, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls which could adversely impact the market price of our common stock. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting which may result in a loss of public confidence in our internal controls and adversely impact the market price of our common stock. In addition, any failure to implement required, new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.  Risks Related to our Common Stock  Provisions in our charter and bylaws and our stockholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  Our charter, bylaws and the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control. In addition, we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control. These provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock.    35    Table of Contents Our stock price is volatile.  The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. We believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:        •    announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, including changes in reimbursement rates or regulatory requirements, proposed and completed acquisitions, or the industry in which we compete;        •    published studies and reports relating to the comparative efficacy of products and markets in which we participate;        •    quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels;        •    general conditions in the worldwide economy;        •    announcements of technological innovations;        •    new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;        •    developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; and        •    developments in relationships with our customers and suppliers.  In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “high-tech” companies, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may decline.      Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
