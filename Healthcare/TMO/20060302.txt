Item 1A.   Risk Factors        Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 3.  We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer.   Development of our products requires significant investment; our products and technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue.   Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. These activities require us to make significant investments.   Products in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological change because of quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of new products and technologies that make existing products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. The products that we are currently developing, or those we will develop in the future, may not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace, and our products or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete.      Financial Statement Index   16      Table of Contents     It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:      ·   finding new markets for our products;          ·   developing new applications for our technologies;          ·   combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively;          ·   allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;          ·   continuing key customer initiatives;         ·   expanding our service offerings;         ·   strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; and          ·   continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our breadth in product offerings.      We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the growth of our business.  Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.   We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.     Financial Statement Index   17      Table of Contents       Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. For example, in September 2004 Applied Biosystems/MDS Scientific Instruments and related parties brought a lawsuit against us alleging our mass spectrometer systems infringe a patent held by the plaintiffs. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. These policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products.  Our results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential future benefits from new productivity initiatives. We continue to pursue practical process improvement (PPI) programs and other cost saving initiatives at our locations which are designed to further enhance our productivity, efficiency and customer satisfaction. While we anticipate continued benefits from these initiatives, future benefits are expected to be fewer and smaller in size and may be more difficult to achieve.  Our Measurement and Control segment sells products and services to a number of companies that operate in cyclical industries; downturns in those industries would adversely affect our results of operations. The growth and profitability of some of our businesses in the Measurement and Control segment depend in part on sales to industries that are subject to cyclical downturns. For example, certain businesses in this segment depend in part on sales to the steel, cement and semiconductor industries. Slowdowns in these industries would adversely affect sales by these businesses, which in turn would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.  Our business is impacted by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Adverse economic conditions could adversely impact our business in 2006 and beyond, resulting in:     ·   reduced demand for some of our products;         ·   increased rate of order cancellations or delays;         ·   increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;         ·   increased pressure on the prices for our products and services; and         ·   greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable.      Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.     Financial Statement Index   18      Table of Contents     If any of our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation, we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. The products sold by our environmental instruments division include a comprehensive range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could pass through the product undetected, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.  Our branding strategy could be unsuccessful. We historically operated our business largely as autonomous, unaffiliated companies, and as a result, each of our businesses independently created and developed its own brand names. Our marketing and branding strategy transitions multiple, unrelated brands to one brand, Thermo Electron. Several of our former brands such as Finnigan and Nicolet commanded strong market recognition and customer loyalty. We believe the transition to the one brand enhances and strengthens our collective brand image and brand awareness across the entire company. Our success in promoting our brand depends on many factors, including effective communication of the transition to our customers, acceptance and recognition by customers of this brand and successful execution of the branding campaign by our marketing and sales teams. If we are not successful with this strategy, we may experience erosion in our product recognition, brand image and customer loyalty and a decrease in demand for our products.  Our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including antitrust, approvals. We may not be able to identify and successfully complete transactions. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business. For example, we will need to integrate the Kendro business that we recently acquired in order to realize its anticipated cost savings and synergies.  Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill on our balance sheet, which amounts to approximately $1.97 billion as of December 31, 2005. We assess the realizability of the goodwill we have on our books annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired. These events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.  We have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold. From 1997 through 2004, we divested over 60 businesses with aggregate annual revenues in excess of $2 billion. As part of these transactions, we retained responsibility for some of the contingent liabilities related to these businesses, such as lawsuits, product liability and environmental claims and potential claims by buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were inaccurate. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition; however, we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.     Financial Statement Index   19      Table of Contents     As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. International revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets. In 2005, our international revenues from continuing operations, including export revenues from the United States, accounted for approximately 58% of our total revenues. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets, where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. In addition, reported sales made in non-U.S. currencies by our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. Should our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2005, currency translation had an unfavorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of $4.5 million due to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services. In 2004, currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of $92.1 million due to weakening of the U.S. dollar.  We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.  Unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could interfere with our operations. As a part of the effort to upgrade our current information systems, we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner: provide quotes, take customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins. As a result, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.    Our debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities.   As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $598.8 million in outstanding indebtedness.  We have $250 million in additional borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility and $83 million available under our euro facility. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.  Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions.      Financial Statement Index   20      Table of Contents     Our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations. If we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.  Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The financial covenants in our U.S. dollar revolving credit facility and euro facility include interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios. Specifically, the company agrees that, so long as the commitments remain in effect or any loan or other amount is outstanding under the loan agreements, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined in the loan agreements):      ·   the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be less than 3.25:1.00; or         ·   the Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated Total Capitalization ratio at the end of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 0.50:1.00.      Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates.  Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.  Earthquakes could disrupt our operations in California. One of the company’s principal operations, which manufactures analytical instruments, is located in San Jose, a region near major California earthquake faults. Our operating results could be materially affected in the event of a major earthquake.      Item 1B.   Unresolved Staff Comments
