Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.    In addition to external forces discussed in the preceding paragraph, our results of operations are impacted by levels and mix of membership. During 2009, we experienced membership declines due to current economic conditions. We expect unemployment levels will remain high throughout 2010, which may impact our ability to increase or maintain current membership levels. These membership trends could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. For additional discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in of this Form 10-K.    We believe health care is local and feel that we have the strong local presence required to understand and meet local customer needs. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver what customers want: innovative, choice-based products; distinctive service; simplified transactions; and better access to information for quality care. Our local presence and national expertise have created opportunities for collaborative programs that reward physicians and hospitals for clinical quality and excellence. We feel that our commitment to health improvement and care management provides added value to customers and health care professionals.    In January 2007, we unveiled a comprehensive plan to help address the growing ranks of the uninsured. Our plan is a blend of public and private initiatives aimed at ensuring universal coverage for children and providing new and more attractive options for the uninsured. This plan is part of our mission to improve the lives of the people we serve and the health of our communities. In furtherance of our plan, we have launched an interactive website for the uninsured and opened community resource centers to assist the uninsured to obtain health insurance coverage.    We believe that an essential ingredient for practical and sustainable health care reform is improving quality, which can help manage costs. We have identified solutions that we believe will deliver better health care while reducing costs. These include promoting evidence-based medicine and determining real-world outcomes;    4    Table of Contents  advancing health care quality by disseminating information throughout the system; focusing on prevention and managing chronic illness; improving effective use of drug therapies to prevent and manage illness; promoting strategies to reduce medical errors and adverse drug events; reducing costs through eliminating fraud; reducing costs related to litigation; and improving administration.    We continue to expand 360º Health, the industry’s first program to integrate all aspects of care management into a centralized, consumer-friendly resource that assists patients in navigating the health care system, using their health benefits and accessing the most comprehensive and appropriate care available.    In addition, we continue to supplement interactions with customers, brokers, agents, employees and other stakeholders through web-enabled technology and enhancing internal operations. We continue to develop our e-business strategy with the goal of becoming widely regarded as an e-business leader in the health benefits industry. The strategy includes not only sales and distribution of health benefits products on the Internet, but also implementation of advanced capabilities that improve service benefiting customers, agents, brokers, and providers while optimizing administrative costs. These enhancements will also help improve the quality, coordination and safety of health care through increased communications between patients and their physicians.    We intend to continue our expansion and will focus on earnings per share, or EPS, growth through organic membership gains, strategic acquisitions and capital transactions, while pursuing our mission to improve the lives of the people we serve and the health of our communities.    We are a large accelerated filer (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act) and are required, pursuant to Item 101 of Regulation S-K, to provide certain information regarding our website and the availability of certain documents filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our Internet website is www.wellpoint.com. We make available, free of charge or through our Internet website, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the SEC. We also include on our Internet website our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Standards of Ethical Business Conduct and the charter of each standing committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, we intend to disclose on our Internet website any amendments to, or waivers from, our Standards of Ethical Business Conduct that are required to be publicly disclosed pursuant to rules of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE. WellPoint, Inc. is an Indiana corporation incorporated on July 17, 2001.    Significant Events    Listed below are the more significant events that have occurred over the last five years:        •    We regularly review the appropriate use of capital. Accordingly, under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased and retired approximately 57.3 million shares at an average per share price of $46.02, for an aggregate cost of $2.6 billion. On March 5, 2009, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of $1.5 billion in our stock repurchase program. On October 23, 2009, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase of $0.5 billion in our stock repurchase program, subject to completion of the Express Scripts transaction, and pending current market and industry conditions. As of December 31, 2009, $0.4 billion remained authorized for future repurchases. On January 26, 2010, our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by $3.5 billion. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we repurchased and retired approximately 6.5 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $0.4 billion, leaving approximately $3.5 billion for authorized future repurchases at February 10, 2010. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares when we believe it is a prudent use of capital.    5    Table of Contents     •    On December 1, 2009, we sold our prescription benefits management, or PBM, business to Express Scripts, Inc., or Express Scripts, and received $4.7 billion in cash. The pre-tax and after-tax gains on the sale were $3.8 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. During the first quarter of 2010, we will make tax payments of approximately $1.2 billion relating to the PBM sale. We also entered into a 10-year contract for Express Scripts to provide PBM services to our members. We expect this alliance to provide our members with more cost effective solutions as well as access to state-of-the-art PBM services. The results of operations of our PBM business have been included in our consolidated results through November 30, 2009.        •    On October 28, 2009, we announced that we entered into a member transition agreement with Health Care Service Corporation, or HCSC, which operates as Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Illinois and Texas. Under this agreement, HCSC will offer guaranteed replacement coverage to our UniCare commercial group and individual members in those states. Starting on January 1, 2010, certain of our membership began transitioning to HCSC as a result of this agreement. The member transition agreement did not have a material effect on our consolidated cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.        •    On April 9, 2009, we completed our acquisition of DeCare Dental, LLC, or DeCare, a wholly-owned subsidiary of DeCare International. DeCare is one of the country’s largest administrators of dental benefit plans and provides services directly and through partnerships and administrative agreements with ten dental insurance brands, primarily as a third party administrator. DeCare manages benefits for over four million people and is expected to provide our customers with innovative dental products and enhanced customer service.       •    During 2008 and 2009, we worked with The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to resolve issues identified as a result of our internal compliance audits and findings from a 2008 CMS audit. Our work included detailed action plans to remediate such findings. In addition, we engaged an independent third party to provide CMS with on-going assessments regarding our compliance, including verification of systems, processes and procedures.    On January 12, 2009, CMS notified us that we were suspended from marketing to and enrolling new members in our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D health benefit products until remediation efforts had been fully implemented and confirmed. On September 9, 2009, CMS notified us that the sanctions had been lifted. We began marketing our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D products on October 1, 2009 and began enrolling new members on November 15, 2009 for the 2010 contract year. However, we are not currently eligible to receive auto-enrollment or reassignment of Medicare Part D Low Income Subsidy, or LIS, beneficiaries. We continue to work with CMS to demonstrate that our operations related to the Medicare Part D LIS programs have been corrected so that we will again be allowed to participate in the Medicare Part D LIS auto-assignment process.        •    During the year ended December 31, 2008, we settled disputes with the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, relating to certain tax years and industry issues which we had been discussing with the IRS for several years. As a result of the settlements, we recorded additional tax benefits that had previously been denied by the IRS. In addition, tax litigation in the U.S. Tax Court concluded adversely to us during 2008. The case has been appealed to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals and oral arguments are scheduled for February 2010.        •    On August 1, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Imaging Management Holdings, LLC, whose sole business is the holding company parent of American Imaging Management, Inc., or AIM. AIM is a leading radiology benefit management and technology company and provides services to us as well as other customers nationwide, including several other Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees. The acquisition supports our strategy to become the leader in affordable quality care by incorporating AIM’s services and technology for more effective and efficient use of radiology services by our members. The purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $300.0 million in cash.    6    Table of Contents     •    On December 28, 2005 (December 31, 2005 for accounting purposes) we completed our acquisition of WellChoice, Inc., or WellChoice. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the stockholders of WellChoice received consideration of $38.25 in cash and 0.5191 of a share of WellPoint common stock for each share of WellChoice common stock outstanding. In addition, WellChoice stock options and other awards were converted to WellPoint awards in accordance with the merger agreement. The purchase price including cash, fair value of stock and stock awards and estimated transaction costs was approximately $6.5 billion. WellChoice merged with and into WellPoint Holding Corp., a direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of WellPoint, with WellPoint Holding Corp. as the surviving entity in the merger.        •    On July 11, 2005, we announced that an agreement was reached with representatives of more than 700,000 physicians nationwide involved in two multi-district class-action lawsuits against us and other health benefits companies. As part of the agreement, we agreed to pay $135.0 million to physicians and to contribute $5.0 million to a not-for-profit foundation whose mission is to promote higher quality health care and to enhance the delivery of care to the disadvantaged and underserved. In addition, we paid $61.3 million in legal fees, including interest, on October 6, 2007. As a result of the agreement, we incurred a pre-tax expense of $103.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, which represented the final settlement amount of the agreement that was not previously accrued. Appeals of the settlement initially filed by certain physicians have been resolved. Final cash payments under the agreement totaling $209.5 million, including accrued interest, were made on October 5 and 6, 2006.        •    On June 9, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Lumenos, Inc., or Lumenos, for approximately $185.0 million in cash paid to the stockholders of Lumenos. Lumenos was recognized as a pioneer and market leader in consumer-driven health programs.        •    On April 25, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of shares of common stock, which was effected in the form of a 100% common stock dividend. All shareholders of record on May 13, 2005 received one additional share of WellPoint common stock for each share of common stock held on that date. The additional shares of common stock were distributed to shareholders of record in the form of a stock dividend on May 31, 2005. All applicable historical weighted average share and per share amounts and all references to stock compensation data and market prices of our common stock for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been adjusted to reflect this two-for-one stock split.    Industry Overview    The health benefits industry has experienced significant change in the last decade. The increasing focus on health care costs by employers, the government and consumers has led to the growth of alternatives to traditional indemnity health insurance. HMO, PPO and hybrid plans, such as POS plans and CDHPs, are among the various forms of managed care products that have been developed. Through these types of products, insurers attempt to contain the cost of health care by negotiating contracts with hospitals, physicians and other providers to deliver health care to members at favorable rates. These products usually feature medical management and other quality and cost optimization measures such as pre-admission review and approval for certain non-emergency services, pre-authorization of outpatient surgical procedures, network credentialing to determine that network doctors and hospitals have the required certifications and expertise, and various levels of care management programs to help members better understand and navigate the medical system. In addition, providers may have incentives to achieve certain quality measures, may share medical cost risk or have other incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner. Also, certain plans offer members incentives for healthy behaviors, such as smoking cessation and weight management. Members are charged periodic, pre-paid premiums and pay co-payments, coinsurance and deductibles when they receive services. While the distinctions between the various types of plans have lessened over recent years, PPO, POS and CDHP products generally provide reduced benefits for out-of-network services, while traditional HMO products generally provide little to no reimbursement for non-emergency out-of-network utilization. An HMO plan may also require members to select one of the network primary care physicians to coordinate their care and approve any specialist or other services.    7    Table of Contents Recently, economic factors and greater consumer awareness have resulted in the increasing popularity of products that offer larger, more extensive networks, more member choice related to coverage, physicians and hospitals, and a desire for greater flexibility for customers to assume larger deductibles and co-payments in return for lower premiums. CDHPs, which are relatively high deductible PPO products and which are often paired with some type of member health care expenditure account that can be used at the member’s discretion to help fund member out-of-pocket costs, help to meet this demand. CDHPs also usually incorporate member education, wellness, and care management programs, to help customers make better informed health care decisions. We believe we are well-positioned in each of our regions to respond to these market preferences.    Each of the BCBS companies, of which there were 39 independent primary licensees as of December 31, 2009, works cooperatively in a number of ways that create significant market advantages, especially when competing for very large multi-state employer groups. As a result of this cooperation, each BCBS company is able to take advantage of other BCBS licensees’ substantial provider networks and discounts when any BCBS member works or travels outside of the state in which their policy is written. This program is referred to as BlueCard®, and is a source of revenue for providing member services in our states for individuals who are customers of BCBS plans not affiliated with us.    Competition    The managed care industry is highly competitive, both nationally and in our regional markets. Competition continues to be intense due to aggressive marketing, business consolidations, a proliferation of new products and increased quality awareness and price sensitivity among customers.    Health benefits industry participants compete for customers mainly on the following factors:        •    quality of service;        •    access to provider networks;        •    access to care management and wellness programs, including health information;        •    innovation, breadth and flexibility of products and benefits;        •    reputation (including National Committee on Quality Assurance, or NCQA, accreditation status);        •    brand recognition;        •    price; and        •    financial stability.    Over the last few years, a health plan’s ability to interact with employers, members and other third parties (including health care professionals) via the Internet has become a more important competitive factor. During the last several years, we have made significant investments in technology to enhance our electronic interaction with providers, employers, members and third parties.    We believe our exclusive right to market products under the most recognized brand in the industry, BCBS, in our most significant markets provides us with an advantage over our competition. In addition, our provider networks in our regions enable us to achieve cost-efficiencies and service levels enabling us to offer a broad range of health benefits to our customers on a more cost-effective basis than many of our competitors. We strive to distinguish our products through provider access, service, care management, product value and brand recognition.    To build our provider networks, we compete with other health benefits plans for the best contracts with hospitals, physicians and other providers. We believe that physicians and other providers primarily consider member volume, reimbursement rates, timeliness of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities along with the reduction of non-value added administrative tasks when deciding whether to contract with a health benefits plan.    8    Table of Contents At the sales and distribution level, we compete for qualified agents and brokers to recommend and distribute our products. Strong competition exists among insurance companies and health benefits plans for agents and brokers with demonstrated ability to secure new business and maintain existing accounts. We believe that quality and price of our products, support services, reputation and prior relationships, along with a reasonable commission structure are the factors agents and brokers consider in choosing whether to market our products. We believe that we have good relationships with our agents and brokers, and that our products, support services and commission structure compare favorably to our competitors in all of our regions. Typically we are the lead competitor in each of our markets and thus a closely watched target by other insurance competitors.    Reportable Segments    We manage our operations through three reportable segments: Commercial, Consumer, and Other. Segment disclosures for 2007 have been reclassified to conform to the 2009 and 2008 presentation.    Our Commercial and Consumer segments both offer a diversified mix of managed care products, including PPOs, HMOs, traditional indemnity benefits and POS plans, as well as a variety of hybrid benefit plans including CDHPs, hospital only and limited benefit products.    Our Commercial segment includes Local Group (including UniCare), National Accounts and certain other ancillary business operations (dental, vision, life and disability and workers’ compensation). Business units in the Commercial segment offer fully-insured products and provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers, including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management, disease management, wellness programs and other administrative services.    Our Consumer segment includes Senior, State-Sponsored and Individual businesses. Senior business includes services such as Medicare Part D, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare Supplement, while State-Sponsored business includes our managed care alternatives for the Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Plan programs.    Our Other segment includes the Comprehensive Health Solutions Business unit, or CHS, that brings together our resources focused on optimizing the quality of health care and cost of care management. CHS included our PBM business until its sale to Express Scripts on December 1, 2009, and also includes provider relations, care and disease management, employee assistance programs, including behavioral health, radiology benefit management and analytics-driven personal health care guidance. Our Other segment also includes results from our Federal Government Solutions, or FGS, business. FGS business includes the Federal Employee Program, or FEP, and National Government Services, Inc., or NGS, which acts as a Medicare contractor in several regions across the nation. The Other segment also includes other businesses that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, segment reporting guidance, as well as intersegment sales and expense eliminations and corporate expenses not allocated to the other reportable segments.    For additional information regarding the operating results of our segments, see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, included in this Form 10-K.    Products and Services    A general description of our products and services is provided below:    Preferred Provider Organization. PPO products offer the member an option to select any health care provider, with benefits reimbursed by us at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider. Coverage is subject to co-payments or deductibles and coinsurance, with member cost sharing usually limited by out-of-pocket maximums.    9    Table of Contents Consumer-Driven Health Plans. CDHPs provide consumers with increased financial responsibility, choice and control regarding how their health care dollars are spent. Generally, CDHPs combine a high-deductible PPO plan with an employer-funded and/or employee-funded personal care account, which may result in tax benefits to the employee. Some or all of the dollars remaining in the personal care account at year-end can be rolled over to the next year for future health care needs.    Traditional Indemnity. Indemnity products offer the member an option to select any health care provider for covered services. Coverage is subject to deductibles and coinsurance, with member cost sharing usually limited by out-of-pocket maximums.    Health Maintenance Organization. HMO products include comprehensive managed care benefits, generally through a participating network of physicians, hospitals and other providers. A member in one of our HMOs must typically select a primary care physician, or PCP, from our network. PCPs generally are family practitioners, internists or pediatricians who provide necessary preventive and primary medical care, and are generally responsible for coordinating other necessary health care services. We offer HMO plans with varying levels of co-payments, which result in different levels of premium rates.    Point-of-Service. POS products blend the characteristics of HMO, PPO and indemnity plans. Members can have comprehensive HMO-style benefits through participating network providers with minimum out-of-pocket expenses (co-payments) and also can go directly, without a referral, to any provider they choose, subject to, among other things, certain deductibles and coinsurance. Member cost sharing is limited by out-of-pocket maximums.    Administrative Services. In addition to fully-insured products, we provide administrative services to large group employers that maintain self-funded health plans. These administrative services include underwriting, actuarial services, medical management, claims processing and other administrative services for self-funded employers. Self-funded health plans are also able to use our provider networks and to realize savings through our negotiated provider arrangements, while allowing employers the ability to design certain health benefit plans in accordance with their own requirements and objectives. We also underwrite stop loss insurance for self-funded plans.    BlueCard. BlueCard host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer sponsored health plan serviced by a non-WellPoint controlled BCBS licensee, who is the “home” plan. We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard host members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan.    Senior Plans. We offer a wide variety of senior plans, products and options such as Medicare supplement plans, Medicare Advantage (including private fee-for-service plans) and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans, or Medicare Part D. Medicare supplement plans typically pay the difference between health care costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans provide Medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare and often include a Medicare Part D benefit. Medicare Part D offers a prescription drug plan to Medicare and dual eligible (Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. In September 2005, we were awarded contracts to offer Medicare Part D to eligible Medicare beneficiaries in all 50 states. We began offering these plans to customers through our health benefit subsidiaries throughout the country. We served as the exclusive point of sale facilitated enrollment provider as defined by CMS for 2009, 2008 and 2007. On January 12, 2009, CMS notified us that we were suspended from marketing to and enrolling new members in our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D health benefit products until remediation efforts had been fully implemented and confirmed. On September 9, 2009, CMS notified us that the sanctions had been lifted. We began marketing our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D products on October 1, 2009 and began enrolling new members on November 15, 2009 for the 2010 contract year. However,    10    Table of Contents  we are not currently eligible to receive auto-enrollment or reassignment of Medicare Part D Low Income Subsidy, or LIS, beneficiaries. We continue to work with CMS to demonstrate that our operations related to the Medicare Part D LIS programs have been corrected so that we will again be allowed to participate in the Medicare Part D LIS auto-assignment process.    Individual Plans. We offer a full range of health insurance plans with a variety of options and deductibles for individuals under age 65 who are not covered by employer-sponsored coverage. Some of our products target certain demographic populations such as the uninsured, “young invincibles,” (individuals between the ages of 19 and 29), families and those transitioning between jobs or early retirees.     Medicaid Plans and Other State-Sponsored Programs. We have contracts to serve members enrolled in Medicaid, State Children’s Health Insurance programs and other publicly funded health care programs for low income and/or high medical risk individuals. We provide services in California, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.    Pharmacy Products. Until December 1, 2009, we offered pharmacy and PBM services directly to our members through our PBM subsidiaries. Subsequent to the December 1, 2009 sale of our PBM subsidiaries, these services are now managed for us by Express Scripts under our ten-year contract. Pharmacy services incorporate features such as drug formularies, a pharmacy network and maintenance of a prescription drug database and mail order capabilities. PBM services include management of drug utilization through outpatient prescription drug formularies, retrospective review and drug education for physicians, pharmacists and members. Two of our PBM subsidiaries were licensed pharmacies and made prescription dispensing services available through mail order for PBM clients. Our PBM companies also included Precision Rx Specialty Solutions, a full service specialty pharmacy designed to help improve quality and cost of care by coordinating a relatively new class of prescription medications commonly referred to as biopharmaceuticals, also known as specialty medications.     Life Insurance. We offer an array of competitive individual and group life insurance benefit products to both large and small group customers in conjunction with our health plans. The life products include term life and accidental death and dismemberment.    Disability. We offer short-term and long-term disability programs, usually in conjunction with our health plans.    Behavioral Health. We offer specialized behavioral health plans and benefit management. These plans cover mental health and substance abuse treatment services on both an inpatient and an outpatient basis. We have implemented employee assistance and behavioral managed care programs for a wide variety of businesses throughout the United States. These programs are offered through our subsidiaries.    Radiology Benefit Management. We offer outpatient diagnostic imaging management services to health plans. These services include utilization management for advanced diagnostic imaging procedures, network development and optimization, patient safety, claims adjudication and provider payment.    Personal Health Care Guidance. We offer leading analytics-driven personal health care guidance. These services help improve the quality, coordination and safety of health care, enhance communications between patients and their physicians, and reduce medical costs.    Dental. Our dental plans include networks in certain states in which we operate. Many of the dental benefits are provided to customers enrolled in our health plans and are offered on both an insured and self-funded basis. Additionally, we offer managed dental services to other health care plans to assist those other health care plans in providing dental benefits to their customers.    Vision Services. Our vision plans include networks within the states we operate. Many of the vision benefits are provided to customers enrolled in our health plans and are offered on both an insured and self-funded basis.    11    Table of Contents Long-Term Care Insurance. We offer long-term care insurance products to our California members through a subsidiary. The long-term care products include tax-qualified and non-tax qualified versions of a skilled nursing home care plan and comprehensive policies covering skilled, intermediate and custodial long-term care and home health services.    Medicare Administrative Operations. Through our subsidiary, NGS, we serve as a fiscal intermediary, carrier and Medicare administrative contractor providing administrative services for the Medicare program, which generally provides coverage for persons who are 65 or older and for persons who are disabled or with end-stage renal disease. Part A of the Medicare program provides coverage for services provided by hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and other health care facilities. Part B of the Medicare program provides coverage for services provided by physicians, physical and occupational therapists and other professional providers, as well as certain durable medical equipment and medical supplies. CMS is currently conducting competitive procurements to replace the current fiscal intermediary and carrier contracts with contracts that conform to the Federal Acquisition Regulations. These new contracts, referred to as Medicare Administrative Contracts, or MACs, will combine most of the administrative activities currently performed by the existing intermediaries and carriers. At year end 2008, NGS held two MACs as a prime contractor and supported one MACs as a subcontractor. Additionally, NGS was awarded one prime contract and two subcontracts under other MAC awards, but those awards were protested and sustained by the government. To date, the protested awards have not been awarded by CMS. Compensation under the MACs is on a cost plus award fee basis while compensation under the fiscal intermediary and carrier contracts is on a cost reimbursement basis.   Customer Types    Our products are generally developed and marketed with an emphasis on the differing needs of our various customers. In particular, our product development and marketing efforts take into account the differing characteristics between the various customers served by us, including individuals, employers, seniors and Medicaid recipients, as well as the unique needs of educational and public entities, labor groups, federal employee health and benefit programs, national employers and state-run programs servicing low-income, high-risk and under-served markets. Each business unit is responsible for product design, pricing, enrolling, underwriting and servicing customers in specific customer types. We believe that one of the keys to our success has been our focus on distinct customer types, which better enables us to develop benefit plans and services that meet our customers’ unique needs.    Overall, we seek to establish pricing and product designs to achieve an appropriate level of profitability for each of our customer categories balanced with competitive objectives. Our customer definitions were revised in the first quarter of 2008 in accordance with our new organizational structure. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the 2009 and 2008 presentation. As of December 31, 2009, our medical membership customer types included the following categories:        •    Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 2,500 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes UniCare local group members. These groups are generally sold through brokers or consultants working with industry specialists from our in-house sales force. Local Group insurance premiums may be based on claims incurred by the group or sold on a self-insured basis. The customer’s buying decision is typically based upon the size and breadth of our networks, customer service, the quality of our medical management services, the administrative cost included in our quoted price, our financial stability, reputation and our ability to effectively service large complex accounts. Local Group accounted for 47% of our medical members at December 31, 2009.        •    Individual consists of individual customers under age 65 (including UniCare) and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, our in-house sales force or via the Internet. Individual business is sold on a fully-insured basis and is usually    12    Table of Contents       medically underwritten at the point of initial issuance. Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network, and the efficiency of administration. Account turnover is generally higher with Individual as compared to Local Groups. Individual business accounted for 6% of our medical members at December 31, 2009.        •    National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in a WellPoint service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 2,500 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker relationships. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. National Accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. We have a significant advantage when competing for very large National Accounts due to the size and breadth of our networks and our ability to access the national provider networks of BCBS companies and take advantage of their provider discounts in their local markets. National Accounts represented 20% of our medical members at December 31, 2009.        •    BlueCard host customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by WellPoint who receive health care services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-WellPoint controlled BCBSA licensee (i.e., the “home plan”). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard claims received per month. BlueCard host membership accounted for 14% of our medical members at December 31, 2009.        •    Senior customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, or who have purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage. Medicare Supplement policies are sold to Medicare recipients as supplements to the benefits they receive from the Medicare program. Rates are filed with and in some cases approved by state insurance departments. Most of the premium for Medicare Advantage is paid directly by the Federal government on behalf of the participant who may also be charged a small premium. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Senior business accounted for 4% of our medical members at December 31, 2009.        •    State-Sponsored membership represents eligible members with State-Sponsored managed care alternatives in Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Plan programs. Total State-Sponsored program business accounted for 5% of our medical members at December 31, 2009.        •    FEP members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. FEP business accounted for 4% of our medical members at December 31, 2009.    In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two principal funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk.    13    Table of Contents The following tables set forth our medical membership by customer type and funding arrangement:                December 31      2009   2008  (In thousands)           Customer Type:         Local Group   15,643   16,632   Individual   2,131   2,272   National:         National Accounts   6,813   6,720   BlueCard   4,744   4,736             Total National   11,557   11,456   Senior   1,215   1,304   State-Sponsored   1,733   1,992   FEP   1,391   1,393             Total medical membership by customer type   33,670   35,049             Funding Arrangement:         Self-Funded   18,236   18,520   Fully-Insured   15,434   16,529             Total medical membership by funding arrangement   33,670   35,049             For additional information regarding the change in medical membership between years, see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Form 10-K.    In addition to the above medical membership, we also serve customers who purchase one or more of our other products or services that are often ancillary to our health business. Examples of these other products or services include life, disease management and wellness, personal health care guidance, radiology benefit management, vision, and dental. We also provide some of these other products to unaffiliated BCBS or other health plans which contract with us for certain services.    Networks and Provider Relations    Our relationships with physicians, hospitals and professionals that provide health care services to our members are guided by regional and national standards for network development, reimbursement and contract methodologies.    We attempt to provide market-based hospital reimbursement along industry standards. We also seek to ensure that physicians in our network are paid in a timely manner at appropriate rates. We use multi-year contracting strategies, including case or fixed rates, to limit our exposure to medical cost inflation and increase cost predictability. We seek to maintain broad provider networks to ensure member choice, based on both price and access needs, while implementing programs designed to improve the quality of care received by our members.    It is generally our philosophy not to delegate full financial responsibility to our physician providers in the form of capitation-based reimbursement. However, in certain markets we believe capitation can be a useful method to lower costs and reduce underwriting risk, and we therefore have some capitation contracts.    Depending on the consolidation and integration of physician groups and hospitals, reimbursement strategies vary across markets. Fee-for-service is our predominant reimbursement methodology for physicians. Physician fee schedules are developed at the state level based on an assessment of several factors and conditions, including    14    Table of Contents  CMS resource-based relative value system, or RBRVS, changes, medical practice cost inflation and physician supply. We utilize CMS RBRVS fee schedules as a reference point for fee schedule development and analysis. The RBRVS structure was developed and is maintained by CMS, and is used by the Medicare program and other major payers. In addition, we have implemented and continue to expand physician incentive contracting, which recognizes clinical quality and performance as a basis for reimbursement.    Our hospital contracts provide for a variety of reimbursement arrangements depending on local market dynamics and current hospital utilization efficiency. Most hospitals are reimbursed a fixed amount per day or per case for inpatient covered services. Some hospitals, primarily sole community hospitals, are reimbursed on a discount from approved charge basis for covered services. Our “per case” reimbursement methods utilize many of the same attributes contained in Medicare’s Diagnosis Related Groups, or DRG, methodology. Hospital outpatient services are reimbursed by fixed case rates, fee schedules or percent of approved charges. Our hospital contracts recognize unique hospital attributes, such as academic medical centers or community hospitals, and the volume of care performed for our members. To improve predictability of expected cost, we frequently use a multi-year contracting approach and have been transitioning to case rate payment methodologies. Many of our hospital contracts have reimbursement linked to improved clinical performance, patient safety and medical error reduction.    Medical Management Programs    Our medical management programs include a broad array of activities that facilitate improvements in the quality of care provided to our members and promote cost effective medical care. These medical management activities and programs are administered and directed by physicians and trained nurses. One of the goals of our medical management strategies is to ensure that the care delivered to our members is supported by appropriate medical and scientific evidence.    Precertification. A traditional medical management program involves assessment of the appropriateness of certain hospitalizations and other medical services prior to the service being rendered. For example, precertification is used to determine whether a set of hospital and medical services is being appropriately applied to the member’s clinical condition, in accordance with criteria for medical necessity as that term is defined in the member’s benefits contract. Most of our health plans have implemented precertification programs for certain high cost radiology studies, addressing an area of historically significant cost trends. As previously described in Significant Transactions, on August 1, 2007, we completed our acquisition of AIM. We continue to incorporate AIM’s services and technology for more effective and efficient use of diagnostic imaging services by our members.    Concurrent review. Another traditional medical management strategy we use is concurrent review, which is based on nationally recognized criteria developed by third-party medical specialists. With concurrent review, the requirements and intensity of services during a patient’s hospital stay are reviewed, at times by an onsite skilled nurse professional in collaboration with the hospital’s medical and nursing staff, in order to coordinate care and determine the most effective transition of care from the hospital setting.    Formulary management. We have developed formularies, which are selections of drugs based on clinical quality and effectiveness. A pharmacy and therapeutics committee of physicians uses scientific and clinical evidence to ensure that our members have access to the appropriate drug therapies. This function remained with us after the sale of our PBM business.    Medical policy. A medical policy group comprised of physician leaders from various areas of the country, working in cooperation with academic medical centers, practicing community physicians and medical specialty organizations such as the American College of Radiology and national organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and the American Cancer Society, determines our national policy for the application of new medical technologies and treatments.    15    Table of Contents Quality programs. We are actively engaged with our hospital and physician networks to enable them to improve medical and surgical care and achieve better outcomes for our members. We endorse, encourage and incent hospitals and physicians to support national initiatives to improve the quality of clinical care, patient outcomes and to reduce medication errors and hospital infections. We have demonstrated our leadership in developing hospital quality programs.    External review procedures. We work with outside experts through a process of external review to provide our members scientifically and clinically, evidenced-based medical care. When we receive member concerns, we have formal appeals procedures that ultimately allow coverage disputes related to medical necessity decisions under the benefits contract to be settled by independent expert physicians.    Service management. In HMO and POS networks, primary care physicians serve as the overall coordinators of members’ health care needs by providing an array of preventive health services and overseeing referrals to specialists for appropriate medical care. In PPO networks, patients have access to network physicians without a primary care physician serving as the coordinator of care.    Anthem Care Compare. We educate members about high-quality, cost-effective procedures that are covered by their benefit plans. Members are able to access via the internet a comparison of the cost of care, quality ratings and benefit levels for common services at specified facilities, including the facility and professional and ancillary service costs. This allows members to make an educated decision about quality and cost before choosing a provider for these common procedures.    Personal Health Care Guidance. These services help improve the quality, coordination and safety of health care, enhance communications between patients and their physicians, and reduce medical costs. Examples of services include member and physician messaging, providing access to evidence-based medical guidelines, physician quality profiling, and other consulting services.    Care Management Programs    We continue to expand our 360º Health suite of integrated care management programs and tools, offered through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Health Management Corporation. 360º Health offers the following programs, among others, that have been proven to increase quality and reduce medical costs for our members:    ConditionCare and FutureMoms are care management and maternity management programs that serve as excellent adjuncts to physician care. A dedicated nurse and added support from our team of dietitians, exercise physiologists, pharmacists, health educators and other health professionals help participants understand their condition, their doctor’s orders and how to become a better self-manager of their condition.    24/7 NurseLine offers access to qualified, registered nurses anytime. This allows our members to make informed decisions about the appropriate level of care and avoid unnecessary worry. This program also includes a robust audiotape library, accessible by phone, with more than 400 health topics, as well as on-line health education topics designed to educate members about symptoms and treatment of many common health concerns.    ComplexCare is an advanced care management program that reaches out to participants with multiple health care issues who are at risk for frequent and high levels of medical care in order to offer support and assistance in managing their health care needs. ComplexCare identifies candidates through claims analysis using predictive modeling techniques, the use of health risk assessment data, utilization management reports and referrals from a physician or one of our other programs, such as the 24/7 NurseLine.    MyHealth Advantage utilizes integrated information systems and sophisticated data analytics to help our members improve their compliance with evidence-based care guidelines, providing personal care notes that alert members to potential gaps in care, enable more prudent health care choices, and assist in the realization of member out-of-pocket cost savings.    16    Table of Contents MyHealth Coach provides our members with a professional guide who helps them navigate the health care system and make better decisions about their well-being. MyHealth Coach proactively reaches out to people who are at risk for serious health issues or have complex health care needs. Our health coaches help participants understand and manage chronic conditions, handle any health and wellness related services they need and make smart lifestyle choices.    HealthyLifestyles helps employees transform unhealthy habits into positive ones by focusing on behaviors that can have a positive effect on their health and their employer’s financial well-being. HealthyLifestyles programs include smoking cessation, weight management, stress management, physical activity and diet and nutrition.    MyHealth@Anthem is our secure web-based solution, complementing other programs by reinforcing telephonic coaching and mail campaigns. The website engages participants in regularly assessing their health status, gives them feedback about their progress, and tracks important health measures such as blood pressure, weight and blood glucose levels.    Employee Assistance Programs provide many resources that allow members to balance work and personal life by providing quick and easy access to confidential resources to help meet the challenges of daily life. Examples of services available in person as well as via telephone or internet are counseling for child care, health and wellness, financial issues, legal issues, adoption and daily living.    Health Care Quality Initiatives    Increasingly, the health care industry is able to define quality health care based on preventive health measurements, outcomes of care and optimal care management for chronic disease. A key to our success has been our ability to work with our network physicians and hospitals to improve the quality and outcomes of the health care services provided to our members. Our ability to promote quality medical care has been recognized by the NCQA, the largest and most respected national accreditation program for managed care health plans.    Several quality health care measures, including the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set, or HEDIS, have been incorporated into the oversight certification by NCQA. HEDIS measures range from preventive services, such as screening mammography and pediatric immunization, to elements of care, including decreasing the complications of diabetes and improving treatment for patients with heart disease. For the HMO and POS plans, NCQA’s highest accreditation is granted only to those plans that demonstrate levels of service and clinical quality that meet or exceed NCQA’s rigorous requirements for consumer protection and quality improvement. Plans earning this accreditation level must also achieve HEDIS results that are in the highest range of national or regional performance. For the PPO plans, NCQA’s highest accreditation is granted to those plans that have excellent programs for quality improvement and consumer protection and that meet or exceed NCQA’s standards. Overall, our managed care plans have been rated “Excellent”, the highest accreditation, by NCQA.    We have committed to measuring our progress in improving the quality of care that our members and our communities receive through our proprietary Member Health Index, or MHI, and State Health Index, or SHI. The MHI is comprised of 20 clinically relevant measures for our health plan members and combines prevention, care management, clinical outcome and patient safety metrics. The SHI measures the health of all the residents in our BCBSA licensed states, not just our members, using public data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    Our wholly-owned clinical research and health outcomes research subsidiary, HealthCore, has supported biopharmaceutical manufacturers, health professionals, and health plans by enabling more effective medical management and increased physician adherence to evidence based care, and creating new knowledge on the value of clinical therapies, resulting in better care decisions.    17    Table of Contents Our wholly-owned radiology management subsidiary, AIM, has supported quality by implementing utilization management programs for advanced imaging procedures that are based on widely accepted clinical guidelines. These programs promote the most appropriate use of these procedures to improve the quality of overall health care delivered to our members and members of other health plans that are covered under AIM’s programs. In addition to utilization management, AIM has also implemented its OptiNet® program, which promotes more informed selection of diagnostic imaging facilities by providing cost and facility information to physicians at the point that a procedure is ordered. AIM also provides education on radiation exposure associated with advanced diagnostic procedures to members and physicians.    Our wholly-owned analytics-driven personal health care guidance subsidiary, Resolution Health Inc., has supported quality by helping our members take action to get healthy, stay healthy and better manage chronic illness. Our analysis of an individual member’s health data identifies opportunities to improve health care quality and safety; we then send personalized messages to the member, their doctor and care manager to take action. For example, our drug safety messages inform a member’s doctor, pharmacist or care manager of potentially dangerous drug-drug, drug-condition, drug-age, or drug-dose interactions identified in our Drug Safety Scan. This helps improve safety, drug effectiveness and medication adherence.    Pricing and Underwriting of Our Products    We price our products based on our assessment of current health care claim costs and emerging health care cost trends, combined with charges for administrative expenses, risk and profit. We continually review our product designs and pricing guidelines on a national and regional basis so that our products remain competitive and consistent with our profitability goals and strategies.    In applying our pricing to each employer group and customer, we maintain consistent, competitive, strict underwriting standards. We employ our proprietary accumulated actuarial data in determining underwriting and pricing parameters. Where allowed by law and regulation, we underwrite individual policies based upon the medical history of the individual applying for coverage, small groups based upon case specific underwriting procedures and large groups based on each group’s aggregate claim experience. Also, we employ credit underwriting procedures with respect to our self-funded products.    In most circumstances, our pricing and underwriting decisions follow a prospective rating process in which a fixed premium is determined at the beginning of the contract period. For fully-insured business, any deviation, favorable or unfavorable, from the medical costs assumed in determining the premium is our responsibility. Some of our larger groups employ retrospective rating reviews, where positive experience is partially refunded to the group, and negative experience is charged against a rate stabilization fund established from the group’s favorable experience, or charged against future favorable experience.    BCBSA Licenses    We have filed for registration of and maintain several service marks, trademarks and trade names at the federal level and in various states in which we operate. We have the exclusive right to use the BCBS names and marks for our health benefits products in California (Blue Cross only), Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York City metropolitan and surrounding counties, and as Blue Cross or BCBS in selected upstate counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield or Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield (in our New York service areas).    Our license agreements require an annual fee to be paid to the BCBSA. Through 2007, the fee was based upon enrollment and net revenue as defined by BCBSA. Beginning in 2008, the fee was based on enrollment only. BCBSA is a national trade association of Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees, the primary function of    18    Table of Contents  which is to promote and preserve the integrity of the BCBS names and marks, as well as provide certain coordination among the member companies. Each BCBSA licensee is an independent legal organization and is not responsible for obligations of other BCBSA member organizations. We have no right to market products and services using the BCBS names and marks outside of the states in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products.    We believe that the BCBS names and marks are valuable identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace. The license agreements, which have a perpetual term, contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the BCBS names and marks. Upon termination of the license agreements, we would cease to have the right to use the BCBS names and marks in one or more of the states in which we are authorized to use the marks and the BCBSA could thereafter issue licenses to use the BCBS names and marks in those states to another entity. Events that could cause the termination of a license agreement with the BCBSA include failure to comply with minimum capital requirements imposed by the BCBSA, a change of control or violation of the BCBSA ownership limits on our capital stock, impending financial insolvency, the appointment of a trustee or receiver or the commencement of any action against a licensee seeking its dissolution.    The license agreements with the BCBSA contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the BCBS names and marks, including:        •    minimum capital and liquidity requirements;        •    enrollment and customer service performance requirements;        •    participation in programs that provide portability of membership between plans;        •    disclosures to the BCBSA relating to enrollment and financial conditions;        •    disclosures as to the structure of the BCBS system in contracts with third parties and in public statements;        •    plan governance requirements;        •    a requirement that at least 80% (or, in the case of Blue Cross of California, substantially all) of a licensee’s annual combined net revenue attributable to health benefit plans within its service area must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the BCBS names and marks;        •    a requirement that at least 66 2/ 3% of a licensee’s annual combined national revenue attributable to health benefit plans must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the BCBS names and marks;        •    a requirement that neither a plan nor any of its licensed affiliates may permit an entity other than a plan or a licensed affiliate to obtain control of the plan or the licensed affiliate or to acquire a substantial portion of its assets related to licensable services;        •    a requirement that limits beneficial ownership of our capital stock to less than 10% for institutional investors and less than 5% for non-institutional investors;        •    a requirement that we divide our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;        •    a requirement that we guarantee certain contractual and financial obligations of our licensed affiliates; and        •    a requirement that we indemnify the BCBSA against any claims asserted against it resulting from the contractual and financial obligations of any subsidiary that serves as a fiscal intermediary providing administrative services for Medicare Parts A and B.    We believe that we and our licensed affiliates are currently in compliance with these standards. The standards under the license agreements may be modified in certain instances by the BCBSA.    19    Table of Contents Regulation    General    Our operations are subject to comprehensive and detailed state, federal and international regulation throughout the jurisdictions in which we do business. Supervisory agencies, including state health, insurance and corporation departments, have broad authority to:        •    grant, suspend and revoke licenses to transact business;        •    regulate many aspects of our products and services;        •    monitor our solvency and reserve adequacy; and        •    scrutinize our investment activities on the basis of quality, diversification and other quantitative criteria.    To carry out these tasks, these regulators periodically examine our operations and accounts.    Regulation of Insurance Company and HMO Business Activity    The federal government, as well as the governments of the states in which we conduct our operations, have adopted laws and regulations that govern our business activities in various ways. Further, pending health care reform legislation may result in increased federal regulation that could have a significant impact on our business. These laws and regulations, which vary significantly by state, may restrict how we conduct our businesses and may result in additional burdens and costs to us. Areas of governmental regulation include but are not limited to:        •    licensure;        •    premium rates;        •    underwriting and pricing;        •    benefits;        •    eligibility requirements;        •    guaranteed renewability;        •    service areas;        •    market conduct;        •    sales and marketing activities;        •    quality assurance procedures;        •    plan design and disclosures, including mandated benefits;        •    underwriting, marketing and rating restrictions for small group products;        •    utilization review activities;        •    prompt payment of claims;        •    requirements that pharmacy benefit managers pass manufacturers’ rebates to customers;        •    member rights and responsibilities;        •    collection, access or use of protected health information;        •    data reporting, including financial data and standards for electronic transactions;        •    payment of dividends;        •    provider rates of payment;    20    Table of Contents     •    surcharges on provider payments;        •    provider contract forms;        •    provider access standards;        •    premium taxes and assessments for the uninsured and/or underinsured;        •    member and provider complaints and appeals;        •    financial condition (including reserves and minimum capital or risk based capital requirements and investments);        •    reimbursement or payment levels for government funded business; and        •    corporate governance.    These laws and regulations are subject to amendments and changing interpretations in each jurisdiction.    Our Medicare plans, Medicaid plans and other State-Sponsored programs are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations.    States generally require health insurers and HMOs to obtain a certificate of authority prior to commencing operations. If we were to establish a health insurance company or an HMO in any jurisdiction where we do not presently operate, we generally would have to obtain such a certificate. The time necessary to obtain such a certificate varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Each health insurer and HMO must file periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business. In addition, health insurers and HMOs are subject to state examination and periodic license renewal. The health benefits business also may be adversely impacted by court and regulatory decisions that expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations. It is uncertain whether we can recoup, through higher premiums or other measures, the increased costs of mandated benefits or other increased costs caused by potential legislation, regulation or court rulings.    HIPAA and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act    The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes obligations for issuers of health insurance coverage and health benefit plan sponsors. This law requires guaranteed renewability of health care coverage for most group health plans and certain individuals. Also, the law limits exclusions based on preexisting medical conditions.    The Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA imposed a number of requirements on covered entities (including insurers, HMOs, group health plans, providers and clearinghouses). These requirements include uniform standards of common electronic health care transactions; privacy and security regulations; and unique identifier rules for employers, health plans and providers. Recently, additional federal privacy and security requirements, including breach notification, improved enforcement and additional limitations on use and disclosure of protected health information were passed through the HITECH provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and corresponding implementing regulations. Additional implementing regulations relating to HITECH are expected in 2010.    The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally places restrictions on the disclosure of non-public information to non-affiliated third parties, and requires financial institutions, including insurers, to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal information is used, including an opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures. State departments of insurance and certain federal agencies adopted implementing regulations as required by federal law. A number of states have adopted data security laws and/or regulations, regulating data security and/or requiring security breach notification, which may apply to us in certain circumstances. Federal laws and regulations concerning health care and health insurance may be subject to significant change. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.    21    Table of Contents Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974    The provision of services to certain employee welfare benefit plans is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, a complex set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation and enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor. ERISA regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us, the employers who maintain employee welfare benefit plans subject to ERISA and participants in such plans. Some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under ERISA. In addition, certain states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for benefit plans. We provide a variety of products and services to employee welfare benefit plans that are covered by ERISA. Plans subject to ERISA can also be subject to state laws and the question of whether and to what extent ERISA preempts a state law has been, and will continue to be, interpreted by many courts.   HMO and Insurance Holding Company Laws    We are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and HMO subsidiaries are domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates. These holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states’ insurance departments certain reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. In addition, various notice and reporting requirements generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company system, depending on the size and nature of the transactions. Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or, in certain circumstances, prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, HMOs, their parent holding companies and affiliates. Among other provisions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends.    Additionally, the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company, which controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person.    Guaranty Fund Assessments    Under insolvency or guaranty association laws in most states, insurance companies can be assessed for amounts paid by guaranty funds for policyholder losses incurred when an insurance company becomes insolvent. Most state insolvency or guaranty association laws currently provide for assessments based upon the amount of premiums received on insurance underwritten within such state (with a minimum amount payable even if no premium is received). Under many of these guaranty association laws, assessments against insurance companies that issue policies of accident or sickness insurance are made retrospectively.    While the amount and timing of any future assessments cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that future guaranty association assessments for insurer insolvencies will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.    22    Table of Contents Risk-Based Capital Requirements    The states of domicile of our regulated subsidiaries have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies and HMOs based on the RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to assess the capital adequacy of life and health insurers and HMOs, taking into account the risk characteristics of a company’s investments and products. The RBC Model Act sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual company’s business. In general, under these laws, an insurance company or HMO must submit a report of its RBC level to the insurance department or insurance commissioner of its state of domicile for each calendar year.    The law requires increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as a company’s RBC declines. The RBC Model Act provides for four different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of a company’s total adjusted capital (defined as the total of its statutory capital, surplus and asset valuation reserve) to its risk-based capital. The level of regulatory oversight ranges from requiring the company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciling insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its RBC, to mandatory regulatory intervention requiring a company to be placed under regulatory control in a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding. As of December 31, 2009, the RBC levels of our insurance and HMO subsidiaries exceeded all RBC thresholds.    Employees    At December 31, 2009, we had approximately 40,500 employees. As of December 31, 2009, a small portion of employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements: 170 employees in the Sacramento, California area with the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 29; 53 employees in the greater Detroit, Michigan area with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, Local No. 614; 13 employees in the New York city metropolitan area with the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 153; and 29 employees in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 9. Our employees are an important asset, and we seek to develop them to their full potential. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.    ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.    The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all our potential risks or uncertainties. Because of these and other factors, past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance.    Health care reform legislation being considered by Congress may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.    The 2008 elections resulted in a renewed focus on health care issues and many key legislators and newly appointed and elected officials, including President Obama, have proposed significant reform to the health care system. The U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate passed separate health care reform bills late in 2009. Both chambers are seeking to reconcile their bills and it is possible that the reconciled bill may contain the following elements:        •    A special assessment on health insurance providers to fund the legislation.        •    An excise tax on high cost employer-provided health coverage to fund the legislation.    23    Table of Contents     •    A health care exchange to facilitate uninsured individuals’ access to health care coverage from private companies.        •    Elimination of certain caps on health care coverage.        •    The requirement that all citizens must carry health insurance or be subject to a penalty.        •    New regulations around health plan operations that would greatly limit the ability of health plans to accurately price the risk, require health plans to pay a certain percentage of every premium dollar as a medical claim and reduce the variety of product offerings.        •    Guaranteed coverage for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions.    We do not currently know the ultimate outcome of the reconciliation process or the legislation. Depending on the provisions contained in the final law, this legislation could have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.    Changes in state and federal regulations, or the application thereof, may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.    Our insurance, managed health care and HMO subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the insurance, managed health care or HMO regulatory authorities of each state in which they are licensed or authorized to do business, as well as to regulation by federal and local agencies. We cannot assure you that future regulatory action by state insurance or HMO authorities or federal regulatory authorities will not have a material adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of our health benefits or managed care products or on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because of our participation in government-sponsored programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, changes in government regulations or policy with respect to, among other things, reimbursement levels, eligibility requirements and additional governmental participation could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that application of the federal and/or state tax regulatory regime that currently applies to us will not, or future tax regulation by either federal and/or state governmental authorities concerning us could not, have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.    Congress and state legislatures continue to focus on health care delivery and financing issues. Some of the reforms call for universal health care regulation including, but not limited to, the availability of a government sponsored health plan. A number of states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, New York, and Pennsylvania, are contemplating significant reform of their health insurance markets. These proposals include provisions affecting both public programs and privately-financed health insurance arrangements. Broadly stated, these proposals attempt to increase the number of insured by raising or expanding the eligibility levels for public programs and compelling individuals and employers to purchase health coverage. At the same time, they seek to reform the underwriting and marketing practices of health plans. As these proposals are still being debated in the various legislatures, we cannot assure you that, if enacted into law, these proposals would not have a negative impact on our business, operations or financial condition. In addition, several states are considering legislative proposals to require prior regulatory approval of premium rate increases or establish minimum benefit expense ratio thresholds. Finally, Congress and several state legislatures are contemplating the imposition of various taxes and fees on health plans and on insurance coverage and arrangements. If enacted, these federal or state proposals could have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.    From time to time, Congress has considered various forms of managed care reform legislation which, if adopted, could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under ERISA. Additionally, there have been legislative attempts to limit ERISA’s preemptive effect on state laws and litigants’ ability to seek damages beyond the benefits offered under their plans. If adopted, such limitations could increase our liability exposure, could permit greater state regulation of our operations, and could expand the scope of damages, including    24    Table of Contents  punitive damages litigants could be awarded. Other proposed bills and regulations, including those related to consumer-driven health plans and health savings accounts and insurance market reform, at the state and federal levels may impact certain aspects of our business, including premium receipts, provider contracting, claims payments and processing and confidentiality of protected health or other personal information. While we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become effective or, if enacted, what their terms will be, their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business. Further, as we continue to implement our e-business initiatives, uncertainty surrounding the regulatory authority and requirements in this area may make it difficult to ensure compliance.    Our inability to contain health care costs, implement increases in premium rates on a timely basis, maintain adequate reserves for policy benefits, maintain our current provider agreements or avoid a downgrade in our ratings may adversely affect our business and profitability.    Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting health care costs and on our ability to manage future health care costs through underwriting criteria, medical management, product design and negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement have also caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care costs. Changes in health care practices, demographic characteristics, inflation, new technologies, the cost of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, changes in the regulatory environment and numerous other factors affecting the cost of health care may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care costs, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our results of operations. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be adversely affected.    In addition to the challenge of managing health care costs, we face pressure to contain premium rates. Our customer contracts may be subject to renegotiation as customers seek to contain their costs. Alternatively, our customers may move to a competitor to obtain more favorable premiums. Further, federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict our ability to implement changes in premium rates. Fiscal concerns regarding the continued viability of programs such as Medicare and Medicaid may cause decreasing reimbursement rates or a lack of sufficient increase in reimbursement rates for government-sponsored programs in which we participate. A limitation on our ability to increase or maintain our premium or reimbursement levels or a significant loss of membership resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.    The reserves that we establish for health insurance policy benefits and other contractual rights and benefits are based upon assumptions concerning a number of factors, including trends in health care costs, expenses, general economic conditions and other factors. To the extent the actual claims experience is less favorable than estimated based on our underlying assumptions, our incurred losses would increase and future earnings could be adversely affected.    In addition, our profitability is dependent upon our ability to contract on favorable terms with hospitals, physicians and other health care providers. The failure to maintain or to secure new cost-effective health care provider contracts may result in a loss in membership or higher medical costs. In addition, our inability to contract with providers, or the inability of providers to provide adequate care, could adversely affect our business.    Claims-paying ability and financial strength ratings by recognized rating organizations are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and health benefits companies. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future. We believe our strong ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to customers, since ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. If our ratings are downgraded or placed under review, with possible negative implications, such actions could adversely    25    Table of Contents  affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders and creditors, and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock.    A reduction in the enrollment in our health benefits programs could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability.    A reduction in the number of enrollees in our health benefits programs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could contribute to a reduction in enrollment include: reductions in workforce by existing customers; general economic downturn that results in business failures; employers no longer offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or electing to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis; state and federal regulatory changes; failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers; premium increases and benefit changes; our exit from a specific market; negative publicity and news coverage; and failure to attain or maintain nationally recognized accreditations.    There are various risks associated with participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs, and contracting with CMS to provide Medicare Part C and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug benefits.    We offer Medicare approved prescription drug plans (Medicare Part D) and Medicare Advantage plans (Medicare Part C) to Medicare eligible individuals nationwide. In addition, we provide various administrative services for other entities offering medical and/or prescription drug plans to their Medicare eligible employees and retirees through our affiliated companies. We also participate in Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicaid programs and receive revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs to provide benefits under these programs.    Revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments. Funding for these programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities. An unexpected reduction or inadequate government funding for these programs may adversely affect our revenues and financial results.    Risks associated with the Medicare Advantage and Medicare prescription drug plans include potential uncollectability of receivables resulting from processing and/or verifying enrollment, inadequacy of underwriting assumptions, inability to receive and process correct information (including inability due to systems issues by the federal government, the applicable state government or us), uncollectability of premiums from members, increased medical or pharmaceutical costs, and the underlying seasonality of this business. While we believe we have adequately reviewed our assumptions and estimates regarding these complex and wide-ranging programs under Medicare Part C and D, including those related to collectability of receivables and establishment of liabilities, the actual results may be materially different than our assumptions and estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.    The laws and regulations governing participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex, subject to interpretation and can expose us to penalties for non-compliance. If we fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal fines, civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in these programs, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, legislative or regulatory changes to these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.    During 2008, we worked with CMS to resolve issues identified as a result of our internal compliance audits and findings from a 2008 CMS audit. Our work included detailed action plans to remediate such findings. In addition, we engaged an independent third party to provide CMS with on-going assessments regarding our compliance, including verification of systems, processes and procedures.    26    Table of Contents On January 12, 2009, CMS notified us that we were suspended from marketing to and enrolling new members in our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D health benefit products until remediation efforts had been fully implemented and confirmed. On September 9, 2009, CMS notified us that the sanctions had been lifted. We began marketing our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D products on October 1, 2009 and began enrolling new members on November 15, 2009 for the 2010 contract year. However, we are not currently eligible to receive auto-enrollment or reassignment of Medicare Part D Low Income Subsidy, or LIS, beneficiaries. We continue to work with CMS to demonstrate that our operations related to the Medicare Part D LIS programs have been corrected so that we will again be allowed to participate in the Medicare Part D LIS auto-assignment process.    Adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs.    The securities and credit markets have been experiencing higher than normal volatility. In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, make payments on our indebtedness and pay capital expenditures. The principal sources of our cash receipts are premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.    Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If one or a combination of these factors were to occur, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms.    One of our sources of liquidity is our $2.5 billion commercial paper program. The commercial paper markets have recently experienced higher than normal volatility, which has influenced our use of commercial paper. As a result, we have reduced the amount of commercial paper outstanding, with $0.5 billion outstanding at December 31, 2009 as compared to $0.9 billion and $1.8 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We continue to monitor the commercial paper markets and will act in a prudent manner. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we intend to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $2.4 billion senior credit facility to redeem our commercial paper when it matures. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders participating in our senior credit facility will be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations.    The value of our investments is influenced by varying economic and market conditions, and a decrease in value may result in a loss charged to income.    The market values of our investments vary from time to time depending on economic and market conditions. For various reasons, we may sell certain of our investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of the investments. In addition, in periods of declining interest rates, bond calls and mortgage loan prepayments generally increase, resulting in the reinvestment of these funds at the then lower market rates. We cannot assure you that our investment portfolios will produce positive returns in future periods.    Current and long-term available-for-sale investment securities were $17.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and represented 33% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2009. In accordance with FASB guidance for debt and equity investments, we classify fixed maturity and equity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and report those securities at fair value.    27    Table of Contents In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we review our investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis analyzing both quantitative and qualitative factors. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. This review process also entails an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold individual equity securities until they mature or full cost can be recovered.    The current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and material other-than-temporary impairments may be charged to income in future periods, resulting in realized losses.    Regional concentrations of our business may subject us to economic downturns in those regions.    The national economy has experienced a recent downturn, with the potential for continued higher unemployment. Most of our revenues are generated in the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. Due to this concentration of business in these states, we are exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of an economic downturn in these states. If economic conditions continue to deteriorate, we may experience a reduction in existing and new business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.    The health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity, which can adversely affect our business and profitability.    The health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity. Negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by: adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services; requiring us to change our products and services; or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate.    In addition, as long as we use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in marketing our health benefits products and services, any negative publicity concerning the BCBSA or other BCBSA licensees may adversely affect us and the sale of our health benefits products and services. Any such negative publicity could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.    We face competition in many of our markets and customers and brokers have flexibility in moving between competitors.    As a health benefits company, we operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is currently subject to significant changes from business consolidations, new strategic alliances, legislative reform, aggressive marketing practices by other health benefits organizations and market pressures brought about by an informed and organized customer base, particularly among large employers. This environment has produced and will likely continue to produce significant pressures on the profitability of health benefits companies.    We are dependent on the non-exclusive services of independent agents and brokers in the marketing of our health care products, particularly with respect to individuals, seniors and small employer group members. We face intense competition for the services and allegiance of these independent agents and brokers, who may also    28    Table of Contents  market the products of our competitors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.    We face intense competition to attract and retain employees. Further, managing Chief Executive Officer and key executive succession and retention is critical to our success.    We are dependent on retaining existing employees and attracting additional qualified employees to meet current and future needs and achieving productivity gains from our investments in technology. We face intense competition for qualified employees, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that such competition among potential employers will not result in increasing salaries. An inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.    We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for succession of our Chief Executive Officer, and senior management and retention of key executives. While we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us.    A change in our health care product mix may impact our profitability.    Our health care products that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than administrative services products and those health care products where the employer groups assume the underwriting risks. Individuals and small employer groups are more likely to purchase our higher-risk health care products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditures. Typically, government-sponsored programs also involve our higher-risk health care products. A shift of enrollees from more profitable products to less profitable products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.    As a holding company, we are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries. These dividends are necessary to pay our outstanding indebtedness. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to state regulations, including restrictions on the payment of dividends, maintenance of minimum levels of capital and restrictions on investment portfolios.    We are a holding company whose assets include all of the outstanding shares of common stock of our subsidiaries including our intermediate holding companies and regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities. As a holding company, we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries. Furthermore, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us, and creditors of our subsidiaries will have a superior claim to certain of our subsidiaries’ assets. Among other restrictions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. In some states we have made special undertakings that may limit the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our subsidiaries’ ability to make any payments to us will also depend on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, business and tax considerations and other legal restrictions. Our ability to repurchase shares or pay dividends in the future to our shareholders and meet our obligations, including paying operating expenses and debt service on our outstanding and future indebtedness, will depend upon the receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries. An inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in the future in an amount sufficient for us to meet our financial obligations may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.    Most of our regulated subsidiaries are subject to RBC standards, imposed by their states of domicile. These laws are based on the RBC Model Act adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, and require our regulated subsidiaries to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to the    29    Table of Contents  departments of insurance and the NAIC. Failure to maintain the minimum RBC standards could subject our regulated subsidiaries to corrective action, including state supervision or liquidation. Our regulated subsidiaries are currently in compliance with the risk-based capital or other similar requirements imposed by their respective states of domicile. As discussed in more detail below, we are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA which contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations, including minimum capital and liquidity requirements, which could restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends.    Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain riskier investment categories, such as below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and equity investments, which could generate higher returns on our investments. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations might cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and risk-based capital, and, in some instances, require the sale of those investments.    We have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Such indebtedness could also adversely affect our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities.    As of December 31, 2009, we had indebtedness outstanding of approximately $8.4 billion and had available borrowing capacity of approximately $2.4 billion under our revolving credit facility, which expires on September 30, 2011. Our debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal on debt instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to seek extraordinary dividends from our subsidiaries, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. However, these measures might be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service obligations.    We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. Our breach or failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements. If we default under our credit agreements, the lenders could cease to make further extensions of credit or cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under our credit agreements to become immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If the indebtedness under our notes or our credit agreements is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due. Indebtedness could also limit our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities, and may affect our ability to maintain an investment grade rating for our indebtedness.    We face risks related to litigation.    We are, or may in the future, be a party to a variety of legal actions that affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits and administrative charges before government agencies, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims and intellectual property-related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of our products and services. These could include claims relating to the denial of health care benefits; the rescission of health insurance policies; development or application of medical policy; medical malpractice actions; allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities; provider disputes over compensation; provider tiering programs; termination of provider contracts; self-funded business; disputes over co-payment calculations; the PBM business, which was sold on December 1, 2009; reimbursement of out-of-network claims; the failure to disclose certain business or corporate governance practices; and customer audits and contract performance, including government contracts.    Recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. In some cases, substantial non-economic, treble or punitive damages may be sought. We currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance,    30    Table of Contents  insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. Any adverse judgment against us resulting in such damage awards could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.    In addition, we are also involved in pending and threatened litigation of the character incidental to the business transacted, arising out of our operations and our 2001 demutualization, and are from time to time involved as a party in various governmental investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings. These investigations, audits and reviews include routine and special investigations by various state insurance departments, state attorneys general and the U.S. Attorney General. Such investigations could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions. We believe that any liability that may result from any one of these actions, or in the aggregate, is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations or financial position.    For additional information concerning legal actions affecting us, see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Form 10-K.    We are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA that entitle us to the exclusive and in certain areas non-exclusive use of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in our geographic territories. The termination of these license agreements or changes in the terms and conditions of these license agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.    We use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks as identifiers for our products and services under licenses from the BCBSA. Our license agreements with the BCBSA contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks, including: minimum capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the BCBSA; enrollment and customer service performance requirements; participation in programs that provide portability of membership between plans; disclosures to the BCBSA relating to enrollment and financial conditions; disclosures as to the structure of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield system in contracts with third parties and in public statements; plan governance requirements; a requirement that at least 80% (or, in the case of Blue Cross of California, substantially all) of a licensee’s annual combined local net revenue, as defined by the BCBSA, attributable to health benefit plans within its service areas must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks; a requirement that at least 66 2/3% of a licensee’s annual combined national net revenue, as defined by the BCBSA, attributable to health benefit plans must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks; a requirement that neither a plan nor any of its licensed affiliates may permit an entity other than a plan or a licensed affiliate to obtain control of the plan or the licensed affiliate or to acquire a substantial portion of its assets related to licensable services; a requirement that we guarantee certain contractual and financial obligations of our licensed affiliates; and a requirement that we indemnify the BCBSA against any claims asserted against it resulting from the contractual and financial obligations of any subsidiary that serves as a fiscal intermediary providing administrative services for Medicare Parts A and B. Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements could result in a termination of the license agreements.    The standards under the license agreements may be modified in certain instances by the BCBSA. For example, from time to time there have been proposals considered by the BCBSA to modify the terms of the license agreements to restrict various potential business activities of licensees. These proposals have included, among other things, a limitation on the ability of a licensee to make its provider networks available to insurance carriers or other entities not holding a Blue Cross or Blue Shield license. To the extent that such amendments to the license agreements are adopted in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our future expansion plans or results of operations.    Upon the occurrence of an event causing termination of the license agreements, we would no longer have the right to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in one or more of our service areas.    31    Table of Contents  Furthermore, the BCBSA would be free to issue a license to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in these service areas to another entity. Events that could cause the termination of a license agreement with the BCBSA include failure to comply with minimum capital requirements imposed by the BCBSA, a change of control or violation of the BCBSA ownership limitations on our capital stock, impending financial insolvency and the appointment of a trustee or receiver or the commencement of any action against a licensee seeking its dissolution. We believe that the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks are valuable identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace. Accordingly, termination of the license agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.    Upon termination of a license agreement, the BCBSA would impose a “Re-establishment Fee” upon us, which would allow the BCBSA to “re-establish” a Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield presence in the vacated service area. Through December 31, 2009 the fee was set at $91.23 per licensed enrollee. As of December 31, 2009 we reported 28.3 million Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield enrollees. If the Re-establishment Fee was applied to our total Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield enrollees, we would be assessed approximately $2.6 billion by the BCBSA.    Large-scale medical emergencies may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.    Large-scale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death. For example, federal and state law enforcement officials have issued warnings about potential terrorist activity involving biological and other weapons. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes and the potential for a wide-spread pandemic of influenza coupled with the lack of availability of appropriate preventative medicines can have a significant impact on the health of the population of wide-spread areas. If the United States were to experience widespread bioterrorism or other attacks, large-scale natural disasters in our concentrated coverage areas or a large-scale pandemic or epidemic, our covered medical expenses could rise and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations or, in the event of extreme circumstances, our viability could be threatened.    We have built a significant portion of our current business through mergers and acquisitions and we expect to pursue acquisitions in the future.    The following are some of the risks associated with acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:        •    some of the acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow;        •    we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or which were under-estimated;        •    we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, or as quickly as expected, and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;        •    acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures;        •    we may finance future acquisitions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders;        •    we may also incur additional debt related to future acquisitions; and        •    we would be competing with other firms, some of which may have greater financial and other resources, to acquire attractive companies.    The value of our intangible assets may become impaired.    Due largely to our past mergers and acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $21.5 billion as of December 31,    32    Table of Contents  2009, representing approximately 41% of our total assets and 87% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2009. If we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets.    In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to income may be necessary. This impairment testing requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, including goodwill and other intangibles (with indefinite lives). In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately. Estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in future impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.    Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders’ equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants.    We may not be able to realize the value of our deferred tax assets.    In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we separately recognize deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded.    At each financial reporting date, we evaluate our deferred tax assets to determine the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences. Our evaluation includes a review of the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset; the amount of taxes paid on both capital gains and ordinary income in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim; the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, the likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and any other significant issues that might impact the realization of the deferred tax asset. While we have certain tax planning strategies that we believe will enable us to fully utilize all remaining deferred tax assets, if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized, we will establish a valuation allowance. Significant judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance.    Any future increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense and a decrease in shareholders’ equity, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the increase occurs. A material decrease in shareholders’ equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants.    An unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and profitability.    As part of our normal operations, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential member information. We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information, including HIPAA and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information, whether by us or by one of our vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.    33    Table of Contents The failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information systems could adversely affect our business.    Our business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different information systems for our various businesses. As a result of our merger and acquisition activities, we have acquired additional systems. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. In addition, we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systems-related or other services or facilities from independent third parties, which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately.    Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the information we rely upon to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could have a decrease in membership, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing and reserves, have disputes with customers and providers, have regulatory problems, sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. In addition, as we convert or migrate members to our more efficient and effective systems, the risk of disruption in our customer service is increased during the migration or conversion process and such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.    We are working towards becoming a premier e-business organization by modernizing interactions with customers, brokers, agents, providers, employees and other stakeholders through web-enabling technology and redesigning internal operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to fully realize our e-business vision. The failure to maintain successful e-business capabilities could result in competitive and cost disadvantages to us as compared to our competitors.    We are dependent on the success of our relationship with a large vendor for a significant portion of our information system resources and certain other vendors for various other services.    We have an agreement with International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, pursuant to which we outsourced a significant portion of our data center operations and certain core applications development. We are dependent upon IBM for these support functions. The IBM agreement includes service level agreements, or SLAs, related to issues such as performance and job disruption, with significant financial penalties if these SLAs are not met, as well as termination assistance provisions obligating IBM to provide services during periods following transitions or terminations. If our relationship with IBM is significantly disrupted for any reason, we may not be able to find an alternative partner in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. As a result, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. We also outsource a component of our data center to another vendor, which could assume much of the IBM work and mitigate business disruption should a termination with IBM occur. We may not be adequately indemnified against all possible losses through the terms and conditions of the IBM agreement. In addition, some of our termination rights are contingent upon payment of a fee, which may be significant.    We have also entered into a ten year contract for Express Scripts to provide PBM services to our members in connection with the sale of our PBM business to Express Scripts in December 2009. If this relationship was terminated for any reason, we may not be able to find alternative partners in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. As a result, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.    34    Table of Contents We have also entered into agreements with large vendors pursuant to which we have outsourced certain functions such as data entry related to claims and billing processes and call center operations for member and provider queries as well as certain Medicare Part D sales. If these vendor relationships were terminated for any reason, we may not be able to find alternative partners in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. As a result, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.    Indiana law, and other applicable laws, and our articles of incorporation and bylaws, may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider in their best interest.    Indiana law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.    We are regulated as an insurance holding company and subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, as well as similar provisions included in the health statutes and regulations of certain states where these subsidiaries are regulated as managed care companies or HMOs. The insurance holding company acts and regulations and these similar health provisions restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes and regulations, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of a domestic insurance company or HMO, or an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company, insurance company or HMO. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person.    Further, the Indiana corporation law contains business combination provisions that, in general, prohibit for five years any business combination with a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our common stock unless the holder’s acquisition of the stock was approved in advance by our Board of Directors. The Indiana corporation law also contains control share acquisition provisions that limit the ability of certain shareholders to vote their shares unless their control share acquisition is approved in advance. In addition, pursuant to a recent amendment to the Indiana corporation law, we are required to divide our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms. Our license agreement with the BCBSA requires, and our articles of incorporation and by-laws provide, the same.    Our articles of incorporation restrict the beneficial ownership of our capital stock in excess of specific ownership limits. The ownership limits restrict beneficial ownership of our voting capital stock to less than 10% for institutional investors and less than 5% for non-institutional investors, both as defined in our articles of incorporation. Additionally, no person may beneficially own shares of our common stock representing a 20% or more ownership interest in us. These restrictions are intended to ensure our compliance with the terms of our licenses with the BCBSA. Our articles of incorporation prohibit ownership of our capital stock beyond these ownership limits without prior approval of a majority of our continuing directors (as defined in our articles of incorporation). In addition, as discussed above in the risk factor describing our license agreements with the BCBSA, such license agreements are subject to termination upon a change of control and re-establishment fees would be imposed upon termination of the license agreements.    Certain other provisions included in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may also have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, our articles of incorporation and by-laws: permit our Board of Directors to determine the    35    Table of Contents  terms of and issue one or more series of preferred stock without further action by shareholders; restrict the maximum number of directors; limit the ability of shareholders to remove directors; impose restrictions on shareholders’ ability to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors; prohibit shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders; impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at meetings of shareholders; impose restrictions on shareholders’ ability to amend our articles of incorporation; and prohibit shareholders from amending our bylaws.    We also face other risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, which include:        •    any requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles;        •    a significant failure of our internal control over financial reporting;        •    our inability to convert to international financial reporting standards, if required;        •    failure of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with internal polices, including data security;        •    provider fraud that is not prevented or detected and impacts our medical costs or those of self-insured customers;        •    failure to protect our proprietary information; and        •    failure of our corporate governance policies or procedures.
