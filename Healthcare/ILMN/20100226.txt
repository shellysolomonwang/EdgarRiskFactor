ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors       Our business is subject to various risks, including those described below. In addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K, the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price.     We face intense competition, which could render our products obsolete, result in significant price reductions, or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell.     We compete with life sciences companies that design, manufacture, and market products for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using a wide-range of competing technologies. We anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition as existing companies develop new or      15    Table of Contents    improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies. One or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical. Some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources, broader product lines, a more established customer base, and more experience in research and development than we do. Furthermore, life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, which are our potential customers and strategic partners, could also develop competing products. We believe that customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular product; therefore, it may be difficult to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased products from competitors. To the extent we are unable to be the first to develop or supply new products, our competitive position may suffer.     The market for molecular diagnostics products is currently limited and highly competitive, with several large companies already having significant market share, intellectual property portfolios, and regulatory expertise. Established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets, including clinical and reference laboratories, which could deter acceptance of our products. In addition, some of these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests.     Our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function.     We design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries. The usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease. We are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function, namely sequencing, genotyping, and gene expression profiling. These markets are new and emerging, and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate, or reach their full potential. Other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing. Also, researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and biological function. For instance, demand for our microarray products may be adversely affected if researchers fail to find meaningful correlations between genetic variation, such as SNPs, and disease susceptibility through genome wide association studies. In addition, factors affecting research and development spending generally, such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions, could harm our business. If useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner, demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect, and we may not be able to sustain profitability.     If the quality of our products does not meet our customers’ expectations, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted.     In the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design, and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Because our instruments and reagents are highly complex, the occurrence of defects may increase as we continue to introduce new products and services. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. In addition, identifying the root cause of quality issues, particularly those affecting reagents, may be difficult, which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and we may incur significant costs or lost revenue in connection with, for example, shipment holds, product recalls, and warranty or other service obligations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image, and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect our business as well as our financial results.     16    Table of Contents    If we do not successfully manage the development and launch of new products or services, including product transitions, our financial results could be adversely affected.     We face risks associated with launching new products and pre-announcing products and services when the products or services have not been fully developed or tested. If our products and services are not able to deliver the performance or results expected by our target markets or are not delivered on a timely basis, our reputation and credibility may suffer. If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date. In addition, we may experience difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions, purchasing decisions, or transition requirements or programs (such as trade-in programs) with respect to newly launched products (or products in development) relative to our existing products, which could adversely affect sales of our existing products. The expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.     If we are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity and develop and maintain operation of our manufacturing capability, we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner, or at all.     We continue to increase our capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products. Although we have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our business plan for 2010, there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner. For example, manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products. Also, we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand, especially as we introduce new products. As a result, we may experience difficulties in meeting customer, collaborator, and internal demand, in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions, and demand for our products could decline. Additionally, in the past, we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions and quality control issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended production of certain products. Due to the intricate nature of manufacturing products that contain DNA, we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields, impact our ability to launch or sell these products (or to produce them economically), prevent us from achieving expected performance levels, or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers.     Additionally, we currently manufacture in a limited number of locations. Our manufacturing facilities are located in San Diego and Hayward, California; Singapore; and Little Chesterford, United Kingdom. These areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or floods. If a natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to fail, we may be unable to manufacture our products, provide our services or develop new products.     Also, many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our custom-designed Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). Additionally, the decoding process in our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage infrastructure. If either our LIMS system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time, it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and could prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period.     Our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies.     As part of our strategy to develop and identify new products, services, and technologies, we have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions of technologies, products, or businesses. Acquisitions involve      17    Table of Contents    numerous risks and operational, financial, and managerial challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations:              •   difficulties in integrating new operations, technologies, products, and personnel;         •   lack of synergies or the inability to realize expected synergies and cost-savings;         •   difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations;         •   underperformance of any acquired technology, product, or business relative to our expectations and the price we paid;         •   negative near-term impacts on financial results after an acquisition, including acquisition-related earnings charges;         •   the potential loss of key employees, customers, and strategic partners of acquired companies;         •   claims by terminated employees and shareholders of acquired companies or other third parties related to the transaction;         •   the issuance of dilutive securities, assumption or incurrence of additional debt obligations or expenses, or use of substantial portions of our cash;         •   diversion of management’s attention and company resources from existing operations of the business;         •   inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies;         •   the impairment of intangible assets as a result of technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of acquired companies; and         •   assumption of, or exposure to, unknown contingent liabilities or liabilities that are difficult to identify or accurately quantify.       In addition, the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas, including sales and marketing, research and development, manufacturing, finance, legal, and information technologies. We cannot assure you that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be, or will remain, profitable. Our failure to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame, or at all.     The timing and extent of funding provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act) could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.     The Recovery Act was enacted in February 2009 to provide stimulus to the U.S. economy in the wake of the economic downturn. As part of the Recovery Act legislation, over $10 billion in funding was provided to the National Institute of Health through September 2010 to support the advancement of scientific research. A portion of the stimulus funding may support the analysis of genetic variation and biological function and have a significant positive impact on our business. In the short-term, however, our customers may delay or reduce their purchases of our products as they wait to learn whether, and to what extent, they will receive stimulus funding. If our customers are unable to obtain stimulus money they may reduce their research and development budgets resulting in a decrease in demand for our products. In addition, it is unclear what will happen to demand for our products after the stimulus funds from the Recovery Act have been allocated and spent. A decline in demand will reduce our revenues, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.     Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.     Our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. The recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the recent global financial      18    Table of Contents    crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including, in particular, reductions or delays in planned improvements to healthcare systems, research and development funding, and purchases of our products and services, or cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, the liquidity of our investment portfolio could be impaired such as when more than $50 million of auction rate securities that we held for investment became illiquid in February 2008 because their scheduled auctions failed. Furthermore, as is the case for almost any other business, we face the following risks from a severe or prolonged economic downturn:              •   severely limited access to financing over an extended period of time, which may limit our ability to fund our growth strategy, could result in a need to delay capital expenditures, acquisitions, or research and development projects;         •   losses from our investment portfolio or to a counterparty’s inability to fulfill its payment obligations;         •   inability to refinance existing debt at competitive rates, reasonable terms, or sufficient amounts; and         •   increased volatility or adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates.       In addition, certain of our customers may face challenges gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding could increase. Additionally, these economic conditions may cause our smaller suppliers to be unable to supply in a timely manner sufficient quantities of customized components, which would impair our ability to manufacture on schedule and at commercially reasonable costs. Suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies, or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.     Our continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and commercializing new products.     Our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs, existing and emerging competition, strong price competition, and frequent new product introductions. Accordingly, our continued growth depends on continuously developing and commercializing new products and services, including improving our existing products and services, in order to address evolving market requirements on a timely basis. If we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies, our products and services will become dated and we could lose our competitive position in the markets that we serve as customers purchase new products offered by our competitors. We believe that successfully introducing new products and technologies in our target markets on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch once that selection is made.     To the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products, or such products are not accepted in the market or suffer significant delays in development, we may lose market share to our competitors, which will be difficult or impossible to regain. An inability, for technological or other reasons, to successfully develop and introduce new products could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. In the past, we have experienced, and are likely to experience in the future, delays in the development and introduction of new products. We cannot assure you that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in our markets or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace, achieve market acceptance, or compete successfully with competing technologies. Some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products and services include:              •   availability, quality, and price relative to competing products and services;         •   the functionality of new and existing products and services;         •   the timing of introduction of the new product or service relative to competing products and services;         •   scientists’ and customers’ opinions of the utility of the new product or service;         •   citation of the new product or service in published research;       19    Table of Contents               •   regulatory trends and approvals; and         •   general trends in life sciences research and applied markets.       We depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for components and materials used in our products, and if shipments from these manufacturers or suppliers are delayed or interrupted, or if the quality of the components or materials supplied do not meet our requirements, we may not be able to launch, manufacture, or ship our products in a timely manner, or at all.     The nature of our products requires customized components and materials that currently are available from a limited number of sources, and, in the case of some components and materials, from only a single source. If deliveries from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason, or if we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply, we may not be able to obtain these components or materials timely or in sufficient quantities or qualities, or at all, in order to meet demand for our products. We may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercial-scale production of some of our products, or develop these capabilities internally, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely basis, in sufficient quantities, or on commercially reasonable terms. Accordingly, we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable, high-volume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs. In addition, the manufacture or shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the quality of the components or materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our requirements. Any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.     An inability to manage our growth or the expansion of our operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.     Our business has grown rapidly, with total revenues increasing from $73.5 million for the year ended January 1, 2006 to $666.3 million for the year ended January 3, 2010 and with the number of employees increasing from 375 to 1,781 during the same period. We expect to continue to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans. The rapid expansion of our business and addition of new personnel may place a strain on our management and operational systems. Our ability to effectively manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational, financial, and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees on a global basis. If we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner, or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls, then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology. Our future operating results will depend on the ability of our management to continue to implement and improve our research, product development, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and customer support programs, enhance our operational and financial control systems, expand, train, and manage our employee base, integrate acquired businesses, and effectively address new issues related to our growth as they arise. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our recent or any future expansion or acquisition successfully, and any inability to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.     If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, we may be unable to achieve our goals.     We are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel, including Jay Flatley, our president and chief executive officer. The loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology, chemistry, biological information processing, sales, marketing, and technical support. We compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies, universities, and research institutions, particularly those focusing on genomics. Competition for these individuals, particularly in the San Diego and San Francisco area, is intense, and the turnover rate can be high. Failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our      20    Table of Contents    products or technologies. Additionally, integration of acquired companies and businesses can be disruptive, causing key employees of the acquired business to leave. Further, we use stock options and restricted stock to provide incentives for our key personnel to remain with us and to align their interests with those of the Company by building long-term stockholder value. If our stock price decreases, the value of these equity awards decreases and therefore reduces a key employee’s incentive to stay.     Doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our business.     Conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources. If we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively, including the risks noted below, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected. We are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets. We have sales offices located internationally throughout Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom and Singapore. During 2009, the majority of our sales to international customers and purchases of raw materials from international suppliers were denominated in U.S. dollars. Shipments to customers outside the United States comprised 48%, 51%, and 43% of our total revenue for the years ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008, and December 30, 2007, respectively. We intend to continue to expand our international presence by selling to customers located outside of the United States and we expect the total amount of non-U.S. sales to continue to grow.     International sales entail a variety of risks, including:              •   longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable outside of the United States;         •   currency exchange fluctuations;         •   challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations;         •   tariffs and other trade barriers;         •   unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of foreign countries into which we sell our products;         •   difficulties in obtaining export licenses or in overcoming other trade barriers and restrictions resulting in delivery delays; and         •   significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws.       Changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell products in the same market. Our revenues from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the U.S. dollar relative to our international customers local currency could make our products more expensive, impacting our ability to compete. Our costs of materials from international suppliers may increase if in order to continue doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of the U.S. dollar decreases relative to their local currency. Foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the United States and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations. The recent global financial downturn has led to a high level of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may continue, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.     We are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions and the possible loss of the tax deduction on our outstanding convertible notes.     We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in existing tax laws or tax rates,      21    Table of Contents    changes in the level of non-deductible expenses (including share-based compensation), changes in our future levels of research and development spending, mergers and acquisitions, or the result of examinations by various tax authorities.     In addition, we could lose some or all of the tax deduction for interest expense associated with our $400 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in 2014 if these notes are not subject to the special Treasury Regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments, the notes are converted, or we invest in non-taxable investments.     Any inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies could harm our competitive position.     Our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the United States and other countries. If we do not protect our intellectual property adequately, competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of the United States. These challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the United States.     The patent positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries, including our patent position, generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. In addition, patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until patents issue, and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months. We intend to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as we deem appropriate. However, our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after they are issued. Questions as to inventorship or ownership may also arise. Any finding that our patents or applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology, and a finding that others have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Furthermore, as issued patents expire, we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop competing products, and, as a result, we may lose revenue.     In addition, our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products. There is also the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies. Also, our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage. We may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, or litigate against third party claims, which would be expensive, and, if we lose, may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace. Furthermore, these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel.     We also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary know-how protection for our confidential and proprietary information, and we have taken security measures to protect this information. These measures, however, may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other confidential information. Among other things, we seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, collaborators, and consultants. There can be no assurance that any confidentiality agreements that we have with our employees, collaborators, and consultants will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and confidential information or will provide adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. Accordingly, there also can be no assurance that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.     22    Table of Contents    Litigation, other proceedings, or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or services.     Our success depends, in part, on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. As we enter new markets, we expect that competitors will likely claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets. In addition, third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents. We could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims. Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse impact on our stock price, which may be disproportionate to the actual import of the ruling itself. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which effectively could block our ability to develop further, commercialize, or sell products, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful infringement claim against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain products. In addition, we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all. We could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our gross margins. In addition, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain profitability.     Our products, if used for the diagnosis of disease, could be subject to government regulation, and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may be expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain both in timing and in outcome.     Our products are not currently subject to FDA clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease. However, as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease, certain of our products are likely to become subject to regulation by the FDA, or comparable agencies of other countries, including requirements for regulatory approval of such products before they can be marketed. Such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain, and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. In addition, changes to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products, which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain FDA or comparable regulatory approval of our products, if required.     Molecular diagnostic products, in particular, depending on their intended use, may be regulated as medical devices by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries and may require either receiving clearance from the FDA following a pre-market notification process or premarket approval from the FDA, in each case prior to marketing. Obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay. If we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop, we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner, or at all.     In addition, the regulatory approval or clearance process required to manufacture, market, and sell our existing and future products that are intended for, and marketed and labeled as, “Research Use Only,” or RUO, is uncertain if such products are used or could be used, even without our consent, for the diagnosis of disease. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our RUO products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.     23    Table of Contents    Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period, and we may not be able to sustain operating profitability.     Our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high-value products and services, the effects of new product launches and related promotions, the impact of seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of research projects our customers perform, the timing of our customers’ funding, changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry, and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns. Given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services, we may experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue. While we anticipate future growth, there is some uncertainty as to the timing of revenue recognition on a quarterly basis. This is because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not linear, with a concentration of orders in the final week of the quarter. In light of that, our revenue cut-off and recognition procedures, together with our manufacturing and shipping operations, may experience increased pressure and demand during the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter.     A large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed, including expenses for facilities, equipment, and personnel. In addition, we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars, and we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products. Accordingly, our ability to sustain profitability will depend, in part, on the rate of growth, if any, of our revenue and on the level of our expenses, and if revenue does not grow as anticipated, we may not be able to maintain annual or quarterly profitability. Any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products, unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the other factors mentioned above, could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue. In addition, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability. Due to the possibility of significant fluctuations in our revenue and expenses, particularly from quarter to quarter, we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance. If our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline.     From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.     Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.     Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.
