Overview   We were incorporated in April 1998. We develop and market next-generation tools for the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and function. Understanding genetic variation and function is critical to the development of personalized medicine, a key goal of genomics. Using our technologies, we have developed a comprehensive line of products that are designed to provide the performance, throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to enable researchers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions of tests necessary to extract medically valuable information from advances in genomics. This information is expected to correlate genetic variation and gene function with particular disease states, enhancing drug discovery, allowing diseases to be detected earlier and more specifically, and permitting better choices of drugs for individual patients.   In 2001, we began commercial sale of short pieces of DNA called oligonucleotides, which we refer to as oligos, manufactured using our proprietary Oligator technology. We believe our Oligator technology is more cost effective than competing technologies, and this advantage enabled us to market our oligos under a price leadership strategy while still achieving attractive gross margins.  2    Table of Contents   In 2001, we commercialized the first implementation of our BeadArray technology, the Sentrix Array Matrix. This is a disposable matrix with 96 fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that matches the standard 96-well microtiter plate. Each fiber optic bundle performs more than 1,500 unique assays, which enables researchers to perform focused genotyping experiments in a high-throughput format. This format was also used to initiate our single nucleotide polymorphism (“SNP”) genotyping services product line. As a result of the increasing market acceptance of our high throughput, low cost BeadArray technology, we have entered into genotyping services contracts with many leading genotyping centers, and were awarded $9.1 million from the National Institutes of Health to play a major role in the first phase of the International HapMap Project.   Our production-scale BeadLab is a turnkey platform that includes all hardware and software necessary to enable researchers to perform genetic analysis research on what we believe is an unprecedented scale. This system is being marketed to a small number of high-throughput genotyping users. As of January 1, 2006, we have installed and recorded revenue for 11 BeadLabs.   In 2003, we announced the launch of several new products, including 1) a new array format, the Sentrix BeadChip, which significantly expands market opportunities for our BeadArray technology and provides increased experimental flexibility for life science researchers; 2) a gene expression product line on both the Sentrix Array Matrix and the Sentrix BeadChip that allows researchers to analyze a focused set of genes across eight to 96 samples on a single array; and 3) a benchtop SNP genotyping and gene expression system, the BeadStation, for performing moderate-scale genotyping and gene expression using our technology. The BeadStation includes our BeadArray Reader, analysis software and assay reagents and is designed to match the throughput requirements and variable automation needs of individual research groups and core labs. Sales of these products began in the first quarter of 2004 and, as of January 1, 2006, we have shipped 115 BeadStations.   In late 2004, we announced a strategic collaboration with Invitrogen Corporation (“Invitrogen”) to synthesize and distribute oligos. In the third quarter of 2005, we began shipping oligo products in connection with this agreement. As part of the agreement, we have developed the next generation of our Oligator DNA synthesis technology, which we have designed to support both plate- and tube-based capabilities. Invitrogen is responsible for sales, marketing and technical support. Profits from sales of collaboration products are divided equally between the two companies.   In 2005, we began shipments of Sentrix BeadChips for whole-genome gene expression and whole-genome genotyping. The whole-genome gene expression BeadChips are designed to enable high-performance, cost-effective, whole-genome expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip, resulting in a dramatic reduction in cost of whole-genome expression analysis. Our whole-genome expression product line includes multi-sample products for both the Human and Mouse Genomes. The whole-genome genotyping BeadChip is designed to scale to high levels of multiplexing without compromising data quality and to provide scientists the ability to query hundreds of thousands of SNPs in parallel. In the second quarter of 2005, we commenced shipment of our first whole-genome genotyping BeadChip, the HumanHap1, which interrogates more than 100,000 SNPs in parallel.   In April 2005, we completed the acquisition of CyVera Corporation, a privately-held Connecticut-based company, pursuant to which CyVera became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Illumina. We believe that CyVera’s digital-microbead platform will be highly complementary to our portfolio of products and services. The acquisition is expected to provide us with a comprehensive approach to bead-based assays for biomarker research and development and in-vitro and molecular diagnostic opportunities, including those that require low-complexity as well as high-complexity testing. We expect the first products based on CyVera’s technology to be available in the second half of 2006. The purchase price associated with the transaction was approximately $17.8 million. We allocated $15.8 million of this purchase price to acquired in-process research and development and charged such amount against earnings in the second quarter of 2005.  3    Table of Contents   In January 2006, we began shipment of the new Sentrix HumanHap300 Genotyping BeadChip to customers around the world. Using the Infinium assay, which enables us to select virtually any SNP in the genome, the HumanHap300 BeadChip offers genomic coverage for more than 317,000 SNPs. We selected the SNP assays in collaboration with a consortium of scientists that are leaders in the genotyping field. We believe this product has quality and performance features that support our expectation that it will become an important discovery tool for researchers seeking to understand the genetic basis of common, yet complex diseases.   We are seeking to continue to expand our customer base for our BeadArray technology; however, we can give no assurance that our sales efforts will continue to be successful.   We were incorporated in California in April 1998. We reincorporated in Delaware in July 2000. Our principal executive offices are located at 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, California 92121. Our telephone number is (858) 202-4500.   Industry Background           Genetic Variation and Function    Every person inherits two copies of each gene, one from each parent. The two copies of each gene may be identical, or they may be different. These differences are referred to as genetic variation. Examples of the physical consequences of genetic variation include differences in eye and hair color. Genetic variation can also have important medical consequences, including predisposition to disease and differential response to drugs. Genetic variation affects disease susceptibility, including predisposition to cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, genetic variation may cause people to respond differently to the same drug treatment. Some people may respond well, others may not respond at all, and still others may experience adverse side effects. A common form of genetic variation is a SNP. A SNP is a variation in a single position in a DNA sequence. It is estimated that the human genome contains over nine million SNPs.   While in some cases a single SNP will be responsible for medically important effects, it is now believed that combinations of SNPs may contribute to the development of most major diseases. Since there are millions of SNPs, it is important to investigate many representative, well-chosen SNPs simultaneously in order to discover medically valuable information.   Another contributor to disease and dysfunction is the over- or under-expression of genes within an organism’s cells. A very complex network of genes interacts to produce healthy individuals. The challenge for scientists is to delineate the associated genes’ expression patterns and their relationship to disease. Until recently, this problem was addressed by investigating effects on a gene-by-gene basis. This is time consuming, and difficulties exist when several pathways can not be observed or “controlled” at the same time. With the advent of microarray technology, thousands of genes can now be tested at the same time.           SNP Genotyping    SNP genotyping is the process of determining which base (A, C, G or T) is present at a particular site in the genome within an individual or other organism. The use of SNP genotyping to obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of an individual SNP or a collection of SNPs, and to apply that information to clinical trials and diagnostic testing, requires the analysis of millions of SNP genotypes and the testing of large populations for each disease. For example, a single large clinical trial could involve genotyping 300,000 SNPs per patient in 1,000 patients, thus requiring 300 million assays. Using previously available technologies, this scale of SNP genotyping was both impractical and prohibitively expensive.  4    Table of Contents   Large-scale SNP genotyping can be used in a variety of ways, including studies designed to understand the genetic contributions to disease (disease association studies), genomics-based drug development, clinical trial analysis, disease predisposition testing, and disease diagnosis. SNP genotyping can also be used outside of healthcare, for example in the development of plants and animals with desirable commercial characteristics. These markets will require billions of SNP genotyping assays annually.           Gene Expression Profiling    Gene expression profiling is the process of determining which genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is accomplished by measuring mRNA, the intermediary messenger between genes (DNA) and proteins. Variation in gene expression can cause disease, or act as an important indicator of disease or predisposition to disease. By comparing gene expression patterns between cells from different environments, such as normal tissue compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a drug, specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in these processes can be identified. Studies of this type, often used in drug discovery, require monitoring thousands, and preferably tens of thousands, of mRNAs in large numbers of samples. Once a smaller set of genes of interest has been identified, researchers can then examine how these genes are expressed or suppressed across numerous samples, for example, within a clinical trial.   As gene expression patterns are correlated to specific diseases, gene expression profiling is becoming an increasingly important diagnostic tool. Diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more cost-effective technologies.   Our Technologies           BeadArray Technology    We have developed a proprietary array technology that enables the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and function. Our BeadArray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously. Our BeadArray technology provides a unique combination of high throughput, cost effectiveness, and flexibility. We achieve high throughput with a high density of test sites per array and we are able to format arrays either in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates or in various configurations in the format of standard microscope slides. We seek to maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive reagents and valuable samples, and through the low manufacturing costs associated with our technologies. Our ability to vary the size, shape and format of the well patterns and to create specific bead pools, or sensors, for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments. We believe that these features have enabled our BeadArray technology to become a leading platform for the emerging high-growth market of SNP genotyping and expect they will enable us to become a key player in the gene expression market.   Our proprietary BeadArray technology combines microwells etched into a substrate and specially prepared beads that self-assemble into an array. We have deployed our BeadArray technology in two different Sentrix array formats, the Array Matrix and the BeadChip. Our first bead-based product was the Array Matrix which incorporates fiber optic bundles. The fiber optic bundles, which we cut into lengths of less than one inch, are manufactured to our specifications. Each bundle is comprised of approximately 50,000 individual fibers and 96 of these bundles are placed into an aluminum plate, which forms an Array Matrix. BeadChips are fabricated in microscope slide-shaped sizes with varying numbers of sample sites per slide. Both formats are chemically etched to create tens to hundreds of thousands of wells for each sample site.  5    Table of Contents   In a separate process, we create sensors by affixing a specific type of molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a batch. We make different batches of beads, with the beads in a given batch coated with one particular type of molecule. The particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function as a sensor. For example, we create a batch of SNP sensors by attaching a particular DNA sequence, or oligo, to each bead in the batch. We combine batches of coated beads to form a pool specific to the type of array we intend to create. A bead pool one milliliter in volume contains sufficient beads to produce thousands of arrays. One of the advantages of this technology is that it allows us to create universal arrays for SNP genotyping, and by varying the reagent kit, we are able to use the array to test for any combination of SNPs.   To form an array, a pool of coated beads is brought into contact with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the wells, one bead per well. The tens of thousands of beads in the wells comprise our individual arrays. Because the beads assemble randomly into the wells, we perform a final procedure called ’decoding’ in order to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array. We employ several proprietary methods for decoding, a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads in the array. One beneficial by-product of the decoding process is a validation of each bead in the array. This quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells. We ensure that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by including multiple copies of each bead type. Multiple bead type copies improve the reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical processing of the results of identical beads. We believe we are the only microarray company to provide this level of quality control in the industry.   An experiment is performed by preparing a sample, such as DNA from a patient, and introducing it to the array. The design features of our Array Matrix allow it to be simply dipped into a solution containing the sample, whereas our BeadChip allows processing of samples on a slide-sized platform. The molecules in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated bead. The BeadArray Reader detects the matched molecules by shining a laser on the fiber optic bundle or on the BeadChip. Since the molecules in the sample have a structure that causes them to emit light in response to a laser, detection of a binding event is possible. This allows the measurement of the number of molecules bound to each coated bead, resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample.           Oligator Technology    Genomic applications require many different short pieces of DNA that can be made synthetically, called oligos. For example, SNP genotyping may require three to four different oligos per assay. A SNP genotyping experiment analyzing 10,000 SNPs may therefore require 30,000 to 40,000 different oligos, contributing significantly to the expense of the experiment.   We have developed our proprietary Oligator technology for the parallel synthesis of many different oligos to meet the requirements of large-scale genomics applications. We believe that our Oligator technology is substantially more cost effective and provides significantly higher throughput than available commercial alternatives. Our synthesis machines are computer controlled and utilize many robotic processes to minimize the amount of labor used in the manufacturing process. In 2005, we implemented our fourth-generation Oligator technology, which is capable of manufacturing up to 13,000 different oligos per run. This is an improvement over prior generations of technology where we could only manufacture approximately 3,000 oligos per run. This increase in scale was necessary to enable us to support the manufacture of oligos under our collaboration with Invitrogen as well as to support our increased need for oligos, a critical component of our BeadArray technology.  6    Table of Contents           Key Advantages of Our BeadArray and Oligator Technologies    We believe that our BeadArray and Oligator technologies provide distinct advantages, in a variety of applications, over competing technologies, by creating cost-effective, highly miniaturized arrays with the following advantages:   High Throughput. The miniaturization of our BeadArray technology provides very high information content per unit area. To increase sample throughput, we have formatted our array matrix in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates, allowing throughput levels of up to nearly 150,000 unique assays per microtiter plate, and we use laboratory robotics to speed process time. Similarly, we have patterned our whole-genome expression BeadChips to support up to 48,000 gene expression assays for six samples with each BeadChip. The Oligator’s parallel synthesis capability allows us to manufacture the diversity of oligos necessary to support large-scale genomic applications.   Cost Effectiveness. Our array products substantially reduce the cost of experiments as a result of our proprietary manufacturing process and our ability to capitalize on cost reductions generated by advances in fiber optics, plasma etching processes, digital imaging and bead chemistry. In addition, these products require smaller reagent volumes than other array technologies, and therefore reduce reagent costs. Our cost-effective Oligator technology further reduces reagent costs, as well as the cost of coating beads.   Flexibility. A wide variety of conventional chemistries are available for attaching different molecules, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and other chemicals to beads. By using beads, we are able to take advantage of these chemistries to create a wide variety of sensors, which we assemble into arrays using the same proprietary manufacturing process. In addition, we can have fiber optic bundles and BeadChips manufactured in multiple shapes and sizes with wells organized in various arrangements to optimize them for different markets and market segments. In combination, the use of beads and etched wells provides the flexibility and scalability for our BeadArray technology to be tailored to perform many applications in many different market segments, from drug discovery to diagnostics. Our Oligator technology allows us to manufacture a wide diversity of lengths and quantities of oligos.   Quality. The quality of our products is dependent upon each element in the system, the array, the assay used to perform the experiment and the instrumentation and software used to capture the results.   Each array is manufactured with a high density of beads which enables us to have multiple copies of each individual bead type. We measure the copies simultaneously and combine them into one data point. This allows us to make a comparison of each bead against its own population of identical beads, which permits the statistical calculation of a more reliable and accurate value for each data point. Finally, the manufacture of the array includes a proprietary decoding step that also functions as a quality control test of every bead on every array, improving the overall quality of the data.   When we develop the assays used with our products we focus on the performance, cost and ease of use. By developing assays that are easy to use, we can minimize the potential for the introduction of experimental error into the experiment. We believe that this enables the researcher to obtain high quality data from their experiments. Additionally, we manufacture substantially all of the reagents used in our assays which allows us to control the quality of the product delivered to the customer.   Our Strategy   Our goal is to make our BeadArray platforms the industry standard for products and services utilizing array technologies. We plan to achieve this by:            •   focusing on emerging high-growth markets;         •   rapidly commercializing our BeadLab, BeadStation, Sentrix Array Matrix and BeadChip products;   7    Table of Contents            •   expanding our technologies into multiple product lines and market segments; and         •   strengthening our technological leadership.    Products and Services   The first implementation of our BeadArray technology, the Sentrix Array Matrix, is a disposable matrix with 96 fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that matches the standard 96-well microtiter plate. Each fiber optic bundle performs more than 1,500 unique assays. The BeadChip, introduced in 2003, is fabricated in multiple configurations to support multiple applications and scanning technologies.   We have provided genotyping services using our proprietary BeadArray technology since 2001. In addition, we have developed our first genotyping and gene expression products based on this technology. These products include disposable Sentrix Array Matrices and BeadChips, GoldenGate and Infinium reagent kits for SNP genotyping, BeadArray Reader scanning instruments and an evolving portfolio of custom and standard gene expression products.           SNP Genotyping    In 2001, we introduced the first commercial application of our BeadArray technology by launching our SNP genotyping services product line. Since this launch, we have had peak days in which we operated at over two million genotypes per day based on individual samples. To our knowledge, no other genotyping platform can achieve comparable levels of throughput while delivering such high accuracy and low cost.   We designed our first consumable BeadArray product, the Sentrix Array Matrix, for SNP genotyping. The Sentrix Array Matrix uses a universal format that allows it to analyze any set of SNPs. We have also developed reagent kits based on GoldenGate assay protocols and the BeadArray Reader, a laser scanner, which is used to read our array products.   Depending on throughput and automation requirements, our customers can select the system configuration to best meet their needs. For production-scale throughput, our BeadLab would be appropriate, and for moderate-scale throughput, our BeadStation would be selected. Our BeadLab includes our BeadArray Reader, combined with LIMS, standard operating procedures and analytical software and fluid handling robotics. This production-scale system was commercialized in late 2002 and when installed, this system can routinely produce millions of genotypes per day.   The BeadStation, a system for performing moderate-scale genotyping designed to match the throughput requirements of individual research groups and core labs, was commercialized in late 2003. The BeadStation includes our BeadArray Reader and genotyping and/or gene expression analysis software. Our BeadStations are fully upgradeable to a full BeadLab through various steps that add automation, sample preparation equipment and LIMS capability. For use in custom SNP genotyping, both the BeadLab and BeadStation utilize GoldenGate assay reagents and our Array Matrix.   In 2003, we announced the availability of an assay set for genetic linkage analysis. This standard product has been deployed in our genotyping services operation and is also sold to customers who use our SNP genotyping systems. Genetic linkage analysis can help identify chromosomal regions with potential disease associations across a related set of samples.   In 2004, we announced a new Sentrix Human-1 Genotyping BeadChip for whole-genome genotyping. This BeadChip provides to scientists the ability to interrogate over 100,000 SNPs located in high-value genetic regions of the human genome. In 2006, we announced the Sentrix HumanHap300 Genotyping BeadChip for larger-scale SNPs studies, which can assay more than 317,000 SNPs displayed across the entire human genome.  8    Table of Contents   In 2005, we announced the MHC Panel Set, which allows the interrogation of a difficult-to-assay area of the genome, often associated with autoimmune diseases. In addition, we announced the Mouse-6 and MouseRef-8 Gene Expression BeadChip allowing the study of the levels of gene expression in mouse model.           Gene Expression Profiling    With the addition of application specific accessory kits, our production-scale BeadLabs and BeadStations are capable of performing a growing number of applications, including gene expression profiling.   In 2003, we introduced our focused set gene expression products on both the Sentrix Array Matrix and Sentrix BeadChip platforms. Our system includes a BeadArray Reader for imaging Sentrix Array Matrices and BeadChips, a hybridization chamber and software for data extraction. In addition, we have developed standard gene expression products for each of the human, mouse and arabidopsis genomes with an additional panel that focuses on human toxicology.   In 2005, we began shipment of the Sentrix Human-6 and HumanRef-8 Expression BeadChip products. Both products allow large-scale expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip and are imaged using our BeadArray Reader. The Human-6 BeadChip is designed to analyze six discrete whole-human-genome samples on one chip, interrogating in each sample approximately 48,000 transcripts from the estimated 30,000 genes in the human genome. The HumanRef-8 BeadChip product analyzes eight samples in parallel against 24,000 transcripts from the roughly 22,000 genes represented in the consensus RefSeq database, a well-characterized whole-genome subset used broadly in genetic analysis. We expect that these gene expression BeadChips will dramatically reduce the cost of whole-genome expression analysis, allowing researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of large-scale biological experimentation.           Scanning Instrumentation    The BeadArray Reader, an instrument we developed, is a key component of both our production-scale BeadLab and our benchtop BeadStation. This scanning equipment uses a laser to read the results of experiments that are captured on our arrays and was designed to be used in all areas of genetic analysis that use our Sentrix Array Matrices and Sentrix BeadChips.           High-Throughput Oligo Synthesis    We have put in place a state of the art oligo manufacturing facility. This facility serves both the commercial needs under our collaboration with Invitrogen and our internal needs. In addition to their use to coat beads, these oligos are components of the reagent kits for our BeadArray products and are used for assay development. We manufacture oligos in a wide range of lengths and in several scales, with the ability to add many types of modifications. We offer a range of quality control options and have implemented a laboratory information management system to control much of the manufacturing process. In 2003, we introduced the first standard product offerings in our Oligator product line, a whole-genome oligo reference set designed and optimized for spotted gene expression microarrays, and in 2004, we introduced a mouse genome oligo set, also for use on spotted gene expression arrays. In 2005, we stopped selling oligos directly into the market and began shipping oligos under our collaboration with Invitrogen.  9    Table of Contents   Collaboration with Invitrogen Corporation   In December 2004, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Invitrogen. The goal of the collaboration is to combine our expertise in oligo manufacturing with the sales, marketing and distribution capabilities of Invitrogen. In connection with the collaboration, we have developed the next generation Oligator® DNA synthesis technology. This technology includes both plate- and tube-based capabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, Invitrogen paid us an upfront non-refundable collaboration payment of $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2005. Additionally, upon the achievement of a certain milestone, Invitrogen was obligated to make a milestone payment of $1.1 million to us. As of January 1, 2006, this milestone has been achieved and the milestone payment was received. We have used these funds to invest in our San Diego facility to enable the development and implementation of fourth-generation Oligator technology and to extend the technology into tube-based oligo products. We began manufacturing and shipping the plate-based and certain tube-based oligo products under the collaboration in the third quarter of 2005. In addition, the agreement provides for the transfer of our Oligator technology into two Invitrogen facilities outside North America. Collaboration profit from the sale of collaboration products will be divided equally between the two companies.   Research and Development   We have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception. We have assembled a team of skilled engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology, chemistry, informatics, instrumentation, optical systems, software, manufacturing and other related areas required to complete the development of our products. Our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to optimize our BeadArray and Oligator technologies and to support commercialization of the products and services derived from these technologies. These efforts include the following, among others:            •   We enhanced the quality and manufacturing yield of our Sentrix Array Matrices and BeadChips. We are exploring ways to continue to increase the level of automation in the manufacturing process to further reduce the time and cost of producing arrays. We intend to add capacity to manufacture Sentrix Array Matrices and BeadChips throughout 2006. We believe this additional capacity will allow us to manufacture our products in sufficient quantity to meet our business plan for 2006.         •   We introduced a number of initiatives in 2002 and 2003 to improve the yield and quality of our oligos while reducing cost substantially. By refining our understanding of the design and operation of our Oligator technology, we have been able to make numerous changes in our process, which we believe provides us a more cost effective system than competing technologies. In 2005, we expanded our Oligator technology under the collaboration agreement with Invitrogen discussed above. In addition, we expanded our oligo manufacturing facility to support high volume shipments.         •   We have developed the BeadArray Reader, a laser scanning instrument that scans our Sentrix array platforms. Laser scanners provide the high sensitivity and resolution required to address the extremely dense geometries of our bead-based arrays. We made the first commercial shipments of our scanners in the first quarter of 2003 as part of our BeadLab.         •   We completed development of and launched our Direct Hyb and DASL gene expression assays on both array formats. We believe the combination of our gene expression products flexibility and low-per-sample cost will enable larger and more meaningful gene expression studies.   10    Table of Contents            •   We completed the CyVera acquisition, which we believe provides us with a comprehensive approach to bead-based assays for biomarker research and development and in-vitro and molecular diagnostic opportunities, including those that require low complexity as well as high-complexity testing. We believe the CyVera technology will be highly complementary to our own portfolio of products and services. We believe it will enhance our capabilities to service our existing customers and accelerate the development of additional technologies, products and services.         •   We completed the development and launch of our Infinium whole-genome genotyping solution. This family of products offers a flexible BeadChip design and high density architecture. Infinium Whole-Genome Genotyping products are based on our BeadArray technology and provide the industry’s only 100% quality control, with an average 30-fold feature redundancy. The revolutionary Infinium assays and corresponding Sentrix BeadChips allow large-scale interrogation of variation in the human genome.         •   We have been exploring the underlying molecular biology and chemistry issues related to developing assays and performing experiments on our BeadArray platforms. By improving our processes and protocols, we have substantially increased the number of assays we can process simultaneously in a single sample on our arrays.    Our research and development expenses for 2005, 2004 and 2003 (inclusive of charges relating to stock-based compensation of $0.1 million, $0.3 million, and $1.3 million, respectively) were $27.7 million, $21.1 million and $22.5 million, respectively. As compared to 2005, we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars during 2006, as we continue to expand our research and product development efforts, but decrease as a percentage of overall revenue in 2006.

We do not believe that the retained license will have any impact on our ability to market our products, and we do not need government approval with respect to this license in order to enter into collaborations or other relationships with third parties. We were the recipient of a grant from the National Institutes of Health covering our participation in the first phase of the International HapMap Project, which is a $100 million, internationally funded successor project to the Human Genome Project that will help identify a map of genetic variations that may be used to perform disease-related research. We received $9.1 million of funding for this project which covered basic research activities, the development of SNP assays and the genotyping to be performed on those assays, all of which was earned in prior years, except for approximately $0.8 million, which was recognized as revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2005.   Intellectual Property   We have an extensive patent portfolio, including, as of February 1, 2006, ownership of, or exclusive licenses to, 38 issued U.S. patents and 102 pending U.S. patent applications, including six allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents, some of which derive from a common parent application. Our issued patents, which cover various aspects of our array, assay, oligo synthesis, instrument and chemical detection technologies, expire between 2011 and 2022. We are seeking to extend this patent protection on our BeadArray, DASL, GoldenGate, Infinium, CyVera, Oligator, Sentrix, Array of Arrays and related technologies. We have received or filed counterparts for many of these patents and applications in one or more foreign countries.  11    Table of Contents   We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, copyright and trademark protection, as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes, to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products used with our BeadArray, DASL, GoldenGate, Infinium, Sentrix, Array of Arrays, CyVera and Oligator technologies.   We are party to various exclusive and non-exclusive license agreements with third parties, which grant us rights to use key aspects of our array technology, assay methods, chemical detection methods, reagent kits and scanning equipment. We have exclusive licenses from Tufts University to patents that cover our use of BeadArray technology. These patents were filed by Dr. David Walt, a member of our board of directors, the Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Board and one of our founders. Our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents, which will occur between 2010 and 2019. In 2001, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Amersham Biosciences that covers certain technology contained in our BeadArray Reader. In 2002, we obtained a non-exclusive license from Dade Behring Marburg GmbH that relates to certain components of our GoldenGate assay. We also have additional nonexclusive licenses from various third parties for other components of our products. In all cases, the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents, may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties while the agreement is in effect.   Marketing and Distribution   Our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the life sciences market, in particular, experiments involving SNP genotyping and gene expression profiling. These experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research, including basic human disease research, pharmaceutical drug discovery and development, pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics and agricultural research. Our potential customers include pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agrichemical, diagnostics and consumer products companies, as well as academic or private research centers. The genetic analysis market is relatively new and emerging and its size and speed of development will be ultimately driven by, among other items:            •   the ability of the research community to extract medically valuable information from genomics and to apply that knowledge to multiple areas of disease-related research and treatment;         •   the availability of sufficiently low cost, high-throughput research tools to enable the large amount of experimentation required to study genetic variation and function; and         •   the availability of government and private industry funding to perform the research required to extract medically relevant information from genomic analysis.    We market and distribute our products directly to customers in North America, major European markets, Japan and Singapore. In each of these areas, we have dedicated sales, service and application support personnel responsible for expanding and managing their respective customer bases. In markets outside of these areas, primarily the Pacific Rim countries and Europe, we sell our products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products. We expect to significantly increase our sales and distribution resources during 2006 and beyond as we launch a number of new products and expand the number of customers that can use our products.   In 2004, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Invitrogen with a goal of leveraging our strength in oligo synthesis with Invitrogen’s extensive sales, marketing and distribution channels. We transitioned all responsibility for oligo sales, marketing and technical support to Invitrogen in the beginning of the third quarter of 2005.  12    Table of Contents   Manufacturing   We manufacture our array platforms, reagent kits, scanning equipment and oligos in-house and believe that we currently have the ability to manufacture these in sufficient quantity to meet our business plan for 2006. We currently depend upon outside suppliers for materials used in the manufacture of our products. We intend to continue, and may extend, the outsourcing of portions of our manufacturing process to subcontractors where we determine it is in our best commercial interests.   During 2001, we moved into a new facility which allowed us to design the manufacturing areas to fit our specific processes, and optimize material flow and personnel movement. In addition, we have implemented information management systems for many of our manufacturing and services operations to manage all aspects of material and sample use. We adhere to access and safety standards required by federal, state and local health ordinances, such as standards for the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances.   Competition   Although we expect that our BeadArray products and services will provide significant advantages over currently available products and services, we expect to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for the SNP genotyping and gene expression markets. These include companies such as Aclara Biosciences (acquired by ViroLogic), Affymetrix, Agilent, Amersham Biosciences (acquired by GE Corp. and now named GE Healthcare), Applied Biosystems, Beckman Coulter, Caliper Technologies, Luminex, ParAllele Bioscience (acquired by Affymetrix), Perlegen Sciences, NimbleGen, Sequenom and Third Wave Technologies. Some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial, technical, research, and other resources and larger, more established marketing, sales, distribution and service organizations than we do. In addition, they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we need to address and in some cases a large installed base of systems. Each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in the future. In order to effectively compete with these companies, we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput, cost and accuracy advantages over the existing products. Rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete. Products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies. Although we believe that our technology and products will offer advantages that will enable us to compete effectively with these companies, we cannot assure you that we will be successful.   Segment and Geographic Information   We operate in one business segment, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of tools for genetic analysis. Our operations are treated as one segment as we only report operating results on an aggregate basis to chief operating decision makers of Illumina.   During 2005, $28.0 million, or 38%, of our total revenue came from customers outside the United States, as compared to $26.4 million, or 52%, in 2004. Sales to territories outside of the United States are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. We expect that sales to international customers will be an important and growing source of revenue. We have sales support resources in Western Europe and direct sales offices in Japan, Singapore and China. In addition, we have distributor relationships in various countries in the Pacific Rim region and Europe.   Information about the geographies in which we operate can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements at Note 11, “Segment Information, Geographic Data and Significant Customers.”  13    Table of Contents   Seasonality   Historically, customer purchasing patterns have not shown significant seasonal variation, although demand for our products is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year as academic customers spend unused budget allocations before the end of the government’s fiscal year.   Environmental Matters   We are dedicated to the protection of our employees and the environment. Our operations require the use of hazardous materials which subject us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. We believe we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations; however, we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur. In addition, we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations, or the development of new laws and regulations, will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.   Employees   As of January 1, 2006, we had a total of 375 employees, 73 of whom hold Ph.D. degrees. 44 of our employees with Ph.D. degrees are engaged in full-time research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relations to be positive.   Executive Officers   Our executive officers as of February 1, 2006, are as follows:                      Name   Age   Position                 Jay T. Flatley       53      President, Chief Executive Officer and Director      Christian O. Henry       37      Vice President, Chief Financial Officer      Tristan B. Orpin       39      Vice President of Worldwide Sales      John R. Stuelpnagel, DVM       48      Co-Founder, Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Director       Jay T. Flatley has served as our President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director since October 1999. Prior to joining Illumina, Mr. Flatley was co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Molecular Dynamics, a life sciences company, from May 1994 to September 1999. He served in various other positions with that company from 1987 to 1994. From 1985 to 1987, Mr. Flatley was Vice President of Engineering and Vice President of Strategic Planning at Plexus Computers, a UNIX computer company. Mr. Flatley also serves as a director at GenVault. Mr. Flatley holds a B.A. in Economics from Claremont McKenna College and a B.S. and M.S. in Industrial Engineering from Stanford University.   Christian O. Henry joined Illumina in June 2005 as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. He is responsible for worldwide financial operations, controllership functions and facilities management. Mr. Henry served previously as the Chief Financial Officer for Tickets.com, a publicly traded, online ticket provider that was recently acquired by Major League Baseball Advanced Media, LP. Prior to that, Mr. Henry was Vice President, Finance and Corporate Controller of Affymetrix, Inc., a publicly traded life sciences company. He previously held a similar position at Nektar Therapeutics (formerly Inhale Therapeutic Systems, Inc.). Mr. Henry received a BA in biochemistry and cell biology from the University of California, San Diego, and an M.B.A. from the University of California, Irvine. Mr. Henry is a certified public accountant.  14    Table of Contents   Tristan B. Orpin has served as our Vice President of Worldwide Sales since December 2002. Prior to joining us, Mr. Orpin was the Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Sequenom, a genomics company, from August 2001 to November 2002, and was Director of Sales and Marketing at Sequenom from September 1999 to August 2001. From December 1988 to September 1999, Mr. Orpin served in several senior sales and marketing positions at Bio-Rad Laboratories, a life sciences company. Mr. Orpin received his BSc. in Biochemistry from the University of Melbourne.   John R. Stuelpnagel, D.V.M., one of our founders, is our Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and has been a director since April 1998. From October 1999 to April 2002, he served as our Vice President of Business Development. From April 1998 to October 1999, he served as our acting President and Chief Executive Officer and was acting Chief Financial Officer through April 2000. While founding Illumina, Dr. Stuelpnagel was an associate with CW Group, a venture capital firm, from June 1997 to September 1998 and with Catalyst Partners, a venture capital firm, from August 1996 to June 1997. Dr. Stuelpnagel received his B.S. in Biochemistry and his Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine from the University of California, Davis and his M.B.A. from the University of California, Los Angeles.             ITEM 1A.  Risk Factors.    Our business is subject to various risks, including those described below. In addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K, the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price.           Litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or services.    Our commercial success depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and the ability to protect our own intellectual property. Affymetrix, Inc. filed a complaint against us in July 2004, alleging infringement of six of its patents, and other third parties have asserted or may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. As we enter new markets, we expect that competitors will likely assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets. In addition, third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents and claim that use of our technologies infringes these patents. We could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims. We may incur the same costs and diversions in enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights against others. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which effectively could block our ability to further develop, commercialize and sell products, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain products. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, or at all. In that event, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our ability to grow and to attain profitability.  15    Table of Contents           We expect intense competition in our target markets, which could render our products obsolete, result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell. This would limit our ability to compete and achieve profitability. If we cannot continuously develop and commercialize new products, our revenue may not grow as intended.    We compete with life sciences companies that design, manufacture and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and function and other applications using technologies such as two-dimensional electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, flow cytometry, microfluidics, next-generation DNA sequencing and mechanically deposited, inkjet and photolithographic arrays. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies. The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs, emerging competition, new product introductions and strong price competition. One or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical. Some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources, broader product lines, a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we have. Furthermore, the life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, which are our potential customers and strategic partners, could develop competing products. If we are unable to develop enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new product offerings, our business, financial condition and results of operations will suffer.           We may encounter difficulties in integrating recently completed or future acquisitions that could adversely affect our business.    In 2005, we acquired CyVera Corporation and may in the future acquire technology, products or businesses related to our current or future business. We have limited experience in acquisition activities and may have to devote substantial time and resources in order to complete acquisitions. Further, these potential acquisitions entail risks, uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business. For example, we may not be able to successfully integrate a company’s operations, technologies, products and services, information systems and personnel into our business. An acquisition may further strain our existing financial and managerial resources, and divert management’s attention away from our other business concerns. In connection with the CyVera acquisition, we assumed certain liabilities and hired certain employees of CyVera, which is expected to result in an increase in research and development expenses and our capital expenditures. There may also be unanticipated costs and liabilities associated with an acquisition that could adversely affect our operating results.           We have only recently achieved profitability and may not be able to remain profitable.    We have incurred net losses each year since our inception. As of January 1, 2006, our accumulated deficit was $144.6 million and we incurred a net loss of $20.9 million for the year ended January 1, 2006. We recorded a modest profit in the fourth quarter of 2005 and we may not be profitable in 2006, due in part to the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123R, which is expected to add additional expense of $9.0 million to $12.0 million in 2006. Our ability to maintain or increase profitability will depend, in part, on the rate of growth, if any, of our revenue and on the level of our expenses. We expect to continue incurring significant expenses for research and development, for developing our manufacturing capabilities and for sales and marketing efforts to commercialize our products. In addition, we expect that our selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the launch of new products. As a result, we expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly as we grow and, consequently, we will need to generate significant additional revenue to maintain profitability. Even if we maintain profitability, we may not be able to increase profitability on a quarterly basis.  16    Table of Contents           The growth and profitability of our oligo business depends on a third party.    In December 2004, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Invitrogen to sell and market our oligos worldwide. Under the terms of the collaboration, Invitrogen is responsible for sales, marketing and technical support, while we are responsible for the manufacture of the collaboration products. As Invitrogen is solely responsible for the sales and marketing support of the collaboration, our continued growth and profitability related to these products depends on the extent to which Invitrogen is successful in penetrating the oligo market and selling the collaboration products. If Invitrogen is not successful in selling the collaboration products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.           We have a limited history of commercial sales of systems and consumable products, and our success depends on our ability to develop commercially successful products and on market acceptance of our new and relatively unproven technologies.    We may not possess all of the resources, capability and intellectual property necessary to develop and commercialize all the products or services that may result from our technologies. Sales of our genotyping and gene expression systems only began in 2003, and some of our other technologies are in the early stages of commercialization or are still in development. You should evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities affecting similarly situated companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. We must conduct a substantial amount of additional research and development before some of our products will be ready for sale and we currently have fewer resources available for research and development activities than many of our competitors. We may not be able to develop or launch new products in a timely manner, or at all, or they may not meet customer requirements or be of sufficient quality or at a price that enables us to compete effectively in the marketplace. Problems frequently encountered in connection with the development or early commercialization of products and services using new and relatively unproven technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully commercialize these products and services. In addition, we may need to enter into agreements to obtain intellectual property necessary to commercialize some of our products or services, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.   Historically, life sciences and pharmaceutical companies have analyzed genetic variation and function using a variety of technologies. In order to be successful, our products must meet the commercial requirements of the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries as tools for the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and function.   Market acceptance will depend on many factors, including:            •   our ability to demonstrate to potential customers the benefits and cost effectiveness of our products and services relative to others available in the market;         •   the extent and effectiveness of our efforts to market, sell and distribute our products;         •   our ability to manufacture products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and reliability and at an acceptable cost;         •   the willingness and ability of customers to adopt new technologies requiring capital investments; and         •   the extended time lag and sales expenses involved between the time a potential customer is contacted on a possible sale of our products and services and the time the sale is consummated or rejected by the customer.   17    Table of Contents           Any inability to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our competitive position.    Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the United States and other countries. If we do not protect our intellectual property adequately, competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights abroad. These problems can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights.   The patent positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries, including our patent position, generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We intend to apply for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate. However, our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after they are issued. Questions as to inventorship may also arise. For example, a former employee recently filed a complaint against us, claiming he is entitled to be named as joint inventor of certain of our U.S. patents and pending U.S. and foreign patents and seeking a judgment that the related patents and applications are unenforceable. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a description of this complaint. Any finding that our patents and applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology, and a finding that others have inventorship rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain licenses to practice the technology, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.   In addition, our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products. There also is risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies. Also, our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage. We may need to initiate additional lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, or litigate against third party claims, which would be expensive and, if we lose, may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace.   We also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. We have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information. These measures, however, may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information. We seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, collaborators and consultants. Nevertheless, employees, collaborators or consultants may still disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.  18    Table of Contents           Our manufacturing capacity may limit our ability to sell our products.    We are currently ramping up our capacity to meet our anticipated demand for our products. Although we have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe that we have plans in place to help ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our business plan in 2006, there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may not be able to increase our capacity in a timely manner. For example, manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facility and launch new products. As a result, we may experience difficulties in meeting customer, collaborator and internal demand, in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions, and demand for our products could decline. Additionally, in the past, we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions that have temporarily reduced production yields. Due to the intricate nature of manufacturing products that contain DNA, we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields, impact our ability to launch or sell these products, or to produce them economically, prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers.           Our sales, marketing and technical support organization may limit our ability to sell our products.    We currently have fewer resources available for sales and marketing and technical support services as compared to our primary competitors. In order to effectively commercialize our genotyping and gene expression systems and other products to follow, we will need to expand our sales, marketing and technical support staff both domestically and internationally. We may not be successful in establishing or maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution arrangements to market our products and services. In addition, we compete primarily with much larger companies, that have larger sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed base of products in place, and the efforts from a limited sales and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market acceptance of our products required to support continued growth of our business.           If we are unable to develop and maintain operation of our manufacturing capability, we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner, or at all.    We currently possess only one facility capable of manufacturing our products and services for both sale to our customers and internal use. If a natural disaster were to significantly damage our facility or if other events were to cause our operations to fail, these events could prevent us from developing and manufacturing our products and services. Also, many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our custom-designed Laboratory Information Management System (“LIMS”). Additionally, as part of the decoding step in our array manufacturing process, we record several images of each array to identify what bead is in each location on the array and to validate each bead in the array. This requires significant network and storage infrastructure. If either our LIMS system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time, it would adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and may prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period.  19    Table of Contents           If we are unable to find third-party manufacturers to manufacture components of our products, we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner, or at all.    The nature of our products requires customized components that currently are available from a limited number of sources. For example, we currently obtain the fiber optic bundles and BeadChip slides included in our products from single vendors. If we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of those or other product components, we will be unable to meet demand for our products. We may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercial-scale production of some of our products, or develop these capabilities internally, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely basis, for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms. Accordingly, we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable, high-volume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs.           We may encounter difficulties in managing our growth. These difficulties could increase our losses.    We expect to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans, which will place a strain on our human and capital resources. If we are unable to manage this growth effectively, our losses could increase. Our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees. If we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner, or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls, then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology. Failure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees will further strain our human resources and could impede our growth.           We may need additional capital in the future. If additional capital is not available on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail or cease operations.    Our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors including our ability to successfully market our genetic analysis systems and services, the need for capital expenditures to support and expand our business, the progress and scope of our research and development projects, the filing, prosecution and enforcement of patent claims, the outcome of our legal proceedings with Affymetrix, the defense of any future litigation involving us and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents, revenue from sales and funding from grants will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating needs, barring unforeseen developments. However, this expectation is based upon on our current operating plan, which may change as a result of many factors. Consequently, we may need additional funding in the future. Our inability to raise capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts. In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations, such as an acquisition, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity, the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders.   We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital available as of January 1, 2006. To the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements, we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies. These funds may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available on attractive terms, we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing, supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms.  20    Table of Contents           If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, we may be unable to achieve our goals.    We are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel, including Jay Flatley, our president and chief executive officer and John Stuelpnagel, our senior vice president and chief operating officer. The loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives. We will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology, chemistry, biological information processing, sales, marketing and technical support. We compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies, universities and research institutions, particularly those focusing on genomics. Competition for these individuals, particularly in the San Diego area, is intense, and the turnover rate can be high. Failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies.   Our planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products developed through our technologies, including the life sciences and healthcare industries. Thus, we will need to add new personnel, including management, and develop the expertise of existing management. The failure to do so could impair the growth of our business.           A significant portion of our sales are to international customers.    Approximately 38% of our revenue for the year ended January 1, 2006 was derived from customers outside the United States. We intend to continue to expand our international presence and export sales to international customers and we expect the total amount of non-U.S. sales to continue to grow. Export sales entail a variety of risks, including:            •   currency exchange fluctuations;         •   unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of foreign countries into which we import our products;         •   difficulties in obtaining export licenses or other trade barriers and restrictions resulting in delivery delays; and         •   significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws.    In addition, sales to international customers typically result in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection. We are also subject to general geopolitical risks, such as political, social and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations. One or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.  21    Table of Contents           Our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and function.    We design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. The usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease. We are initially focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and function, namely SNP genotyping and gene expression profiling. Both of these markets are new and emerging, and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate, or reach their full potential. Other methods of analysis of genetic variation and function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing. Also, researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and function. In addition, factors affecting research and development spending generally, such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions, could harm our business. If useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner, demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.           We expect that our results of operations will fluctuate. This fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline.    Our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high-value products and services projects, the impact of seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of research projects our customers perform, changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry, the timing and amount of government grant funding programs and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns. Given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services, we may experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue. A large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed, including expenses for facilities, equipment and personnel. In addition, we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly. Accordingly, if revenue does not grow as anticipated, we may not be able to maintain profitability. Any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products, unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the other factors mentioned above, could adversely affect our revenue growth in 2006 or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenues. Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses, we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance. If our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, our stock price probably would decline.             Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments.
