ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements set forth at the end of Item 1 of this Form 10-K. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.         24      [Table of Contents]    We derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of drug-eluting coronary stent systems and a decline in market size or our market share of drug-eluting stents may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.   Drug-eluting coronary stent revenues represented approximately 30 percent of our consolidated net sales during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. Our U.S. TAXUS sales declined in 2006 relative to 2005, due in part to a decline in the U.S. market size attributable to recent uncertainty regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug-eluting stents. Late stent thrombosis is the formation of a clot, or thrombus, within the stented area one year or more after implantation of the stent. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the FDA held a special advisory panel meeting to discuss drug-eluting stents. If concerns about the risk of late stent thrombosis persist, there can be no assurance that the market will return to previous levels.    In addition, lower device utilization per procedure and a decline in the overall percutaneous coronary intervention market contributed to the decline in our TAXUS stent system sales in 2006. There can be no assurance that these concerns will be alleviated in the near term or that drug-eluting stent penetration rates will return to previous levels. Our TAXUS® coronary stent system and Johnson & Johnson’s CYPHER® drug-eluting stent system are currently the only two drug-eluting stents available in the U.S. market. We expect our share of the drug-eluting stent market, as well as unit prices, to continue to be adversely affected as additional significant competitors enter the drug-eluting stent market, which began during the third quarter of 2005 internationally and is expected to continue to occur as early as the second half of 2007 in the U.S. In July 2005, Medtronic, Inc. received approval from European regulators to begin commercial sales of its Endeavor® drug-eluting stent system in the European market. As a result of Abbott’s acquisition of Guidant’s drug-eluting stent portfolio, Abbott sells its XIENCE™ V everolimus-eluting stent system in competition with us in certain international markets. In addition, Conor Medsystems, Inc., which was recently acquired by Johnson & Johnson, sells its CoStar® paclitaxel-eluting stent system in competition with us in certain international markets.    The manufacture of our TAXUS® coronary stent system involves the integration of multiple technologies, critical components, raw materials and complex processes. Significant favorable or unfavorable changes in forecasted demand, as well as disruptions associated with our TAXUS® stent manufacturing process, may impact our inventory levels. Variability in expected demand or the timing of the launch of next-generation products may result in excess or expired inventory positions and future inventory charges, which may adversely impact our results from operations. We share with Abbott rights to Guidant’s XIENCE™ V everolimus-eluting stent program. As a result, delays in receipt of regulatory approvals for the XIENCE™ V everolimus-eluting stent system, receipt of insufficient quantities of the PROMUS everolimus-eluting stent from Abbott or material nonacceptance of these stents in the marketplace could adversely affect our results from operations, as well as our ability to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors in the drug-eluting stent market as the leading company with two drug-eluting stent programs.    The worldwide CRM market growth rates declined during 2006 and if the CRM market does not recover, our results of operation and financial condition may be adversely impacted.   During 2005 and 2006, the operating and financial performance of our CRM business has been adversely impacted by various implantable defibrillator and pacemaker system field actions in the industry and a corresponding reduction in CRM market growth rates. We believe that field actions in the industry contributed to our CRM division having a lower market share for implantable defibrillator and pacemaker systems for 2006 as compared to 2005. The worldwide CRM market growth rate, including the U.S. defibrillator market growth rate, declined during the first three quarters of 2006; these growth levels are below those experienced in recent years. The U.S. defibrillator market represents approximately half of the worldwide CRM market. There can be no assurance that the CRM market will return to its historical growth rate          25      [Table of Contents]   or that we will be able to regain CRM market share or increase net sales in a timely manner, if at all.    Because we derive a significant amount of our revenues from our cardiovascular business, changes in market or regulatory conditions that impact that business or our inability to develop non-cardiovascular products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.   During 2006, approximately 80 percent of our net sales were derived from our cardiovascular business, which includes our interventional cardiology, cardiac rhythm management and cardiovascular divisions. As a result, our sales growth and profitability from our cardiovascular business may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to market or regulatory conditions that impact that business. For example, if the worldwide CRM market and the U.S. ICD market do not return to their historical growth rates or we are unable to regain CRM market share or increase CRM net sales, it may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation. Coronary stent revenue represented approximately 32 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2006. If the decline in U.S. drug-eluting stent market penetration attributable to concerns regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug-eluting stents or the declines in device utilization per procedure and overall percutaneous coronary intervention volumes continue, there can be no assurance that the drug-eluting stent market will recover to previous levels which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, our inability to develop products and technologies successfully in addition to our drug-eluting stent and cardiac rhythm management technologies could further expose us to fluctuations and uncertainties in these markets.    We may be unable to resolve issues related to our warning letters in a timely manner, which could delay the production and sale of our products and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.   We are currently taking remedial action in response to certain deficiencies of our quality systems as cited by the FDA in its warning letters to us. For example, on January 26, 2006, we received a corporate warning letter from the FDA notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three of our facilities and advising us that our corrective action plan relating to three site-specific warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. As stated in this FDA warning letter, the FDA may not grant our requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve pre-market approval (PMA) applications for our class III devices to which the quality control or current good manufacturing practices deficiencies described in the letter are reasonably related until the deficiencies have been corrected. If we are unable to resolve the issues raised by the FDA in its warning letters to the satisfaction of the FDA on a timely basis, we may not be able to launch our new class III devices as planned, including our Taxus® Liberté™ drug-eluting stent system in the United States, which may weaken our competitive position in the markets in which we participate.   In addition, in December 2005, Guidant received an FDA warning letter citing certain deficiencies with respect to its manufacturing quality systems and record keeping procedures in its CRM facility in St. Paul, Minnesota. This FDA warning letter followed an inspection by the FDA that was completed on September 1, 2005 and cited a number of observations. Guidant received a follow-up letter from the FDA dated January 5, 2006. As stated in this follow-up letter, until the identified deficiencies have been corrected, the FDA may not grant requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve PMA applications for class III devices to which the deficiencies described are reasonably related. The FDA conducted a further inspection of the CRM facility between December 15, 2005 and February 9, 2006 and made one additional inspectional observation. The FDA has concluded its reinspection of our CRM facilities. We may be required to take additional actions in order to comply with any FDA observations that we may receive.   We may face enforcement actions in connection with these FDA warning letters, including injunctive relief, consent decrees or civil fines. While we are working with the FDA to resolve these issues, this work has required and will continue to require the dedication of significant incremental internal and external resources and has resulted in adjustments to the product launch schedules of certain products and the decision to discontinue certain other product lines over time. There can be no assurances regarding the length of time or cost it will take us to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the FDA. In addition, if our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the FDA, we may have to devote additional financial and human resources to our efforts and the FDA may take further regulatory actions against us including, but not limited to, seizing our product inventory, obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our products, assessing civil monetary penalties or imposing a consent decree on us, which could result in further regulatory constraints, including the governance of our quality system by a third party. If we or our manufacturers fail to adhere to QSR or ISO requirements, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls or other consequences, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.         26      [Table of Contents]   We are subject to extensive medical device regulation which may impede or hinder the approval process for our products and, in some cases, may not ultimately result in approval or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products.    Our products, development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDC Act), by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDC Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In addition, most major markets for medical devices outside the U.S. require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could:    • take a significant period of time;  • require the expenditure of substantial resources;  • involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing;  • require changes to the products; and  • result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products.   Countries around the world have recently adopted more stringent regulatory requirements that are expected to add to the delays and uncertainties associated with new product releases, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those releases. Even after products have received marketing approval or clearance, product approvals and clearances by the FDA can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required clearances from the FDA for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any FDA approval will not be subsequently withdrawn.   In addition, regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, those changes might have on our business. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.   We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.    As a device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR) requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is          27      [Table of Contents]   rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications.    Pending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.    We operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and, in recent years, it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies in order to prevent the marketing of new devices. We are currently the subject of various patent litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Intellectual property litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. Pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel. In the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged, and if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.    We may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property rights which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.    The medical device market in which we primarily participate is in large part technology driven. Physician customers, particularly in interventional cardiology, move quickly to new products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However, intellectual property litigation to defend or create market advantage is inherently complex and unpredictable. Furthermore, appellate courts frequently overturn lower court patent decisions.    In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases, but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the proceedings and are frequently modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies.    Several third parties have asserted that our current and former stent systems or other products infringe patents owned or licensed by them. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain stent products in certain jurisdictions, or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products. In addition, damage awards related to historical sales could be material. We have similarly asserted that stent systems or other products sold by these companies infringe patents owned or licensed by us.   Patents and other proprietary rights are and will be essential to our business, and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S. and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and also attempt to review          28      [Table of Contents]   third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others. We currently own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending. We also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash, cross-licensing rights or royalty payments. No assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in issued patents, that any current or future patents issued to, or licensed by, us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors, or that our patents will not be found invalid.    In addition, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, trade secrets or know-how or to assert them against claimed infringement by others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming to us and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful. We are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual property-related actions. We are involved in numerous patent-related claims with our competitors, including Johnson & Johnson.   The invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own, or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.    Pending and future product liability claims and other litigation, including private securities litigation, shareholder derivative suits and contract litigation, may adversely affect our business, reputation and ability to attract and retain customers.    The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. Many of the medical devices that we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell, including component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information. These factors could result in product liability claims, a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.    We are currently the subject of numerous product liability claims and other litigation, including private securities litigation and shareholder derivative suits including, but not limited to, the claims and litigation described under Item 3. Legal Proceedings. In connection with our acquisition of Guidant, the number of product liability claims and other legal proceedings filed against us, including private securities litigation and shareholder derivative suits, significantly increased. We are currently involved in litigation involving a contract dispute with certain former shareholders of Advanced Bionics Corporation, one of our subsidiaries. The outcome of this litigation could prevent us from operating the Advanced Bionics business in the manner that we expected at the time of acquisition.   The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, including not only actual damages, but also punitive damages. The magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant. Further, we are substantially self-insured with respect to general, product liability claims and securities litigation. As a result of economic factors currently impacting the insurance industry, meaningful product liability and          29      [Table of Contents]   securities litigation insurance coverage has become unavailable due to its economically prohibitive cost. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Product liability claims, product recalls, securities litigation and other litigation in the future, regardless of their outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.    We may not be successful in our strategic acquisitions of, investments in or alliances with, other companies and businesses, which have been a significant source of historical growth for us.    Our strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances are intended to further expand our ability to offer customers effective, high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. Many of these alliances involve equity investments and often give us the option to acquire the other company or assets of the other company in the future. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions, investments and alliances, we may be unable to continue to grow our business significantly or may record asset impairment charges in the future. These acquisitions, investments and alliances have been significant sources of growth for us. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance that we may undertake will depend on a number of factors, including:   •  our ability to identify suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance, if at all;   •  our ability to finance any future acquisition, investment or alliance on terms acceptable to us, if at all;   •  whether we are able to establish an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all;   •  the strength of the other companies’ underlying technology and ability to execute;   •  intellectual property and litigation related to these technologies; and   •  our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company or business with our existing business, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects.    If we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions, investments and alliances, we may be unable to continue to grow our business significantly or may record asset impairment charges in the future.    We incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with our acquisition of Guidant and if we are unable to manage our debt levels and maintain our investment-grade credit ratings, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.   We had outstanding borrowings of $8.9 billion at December 31, 2006, attributable in large part to our acquisition of Guidant. We will be required to use a significant portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our outstanding debt obligations over the next several years. We are examining all of our operations in order to identify cost improvement measures that will better align operating expenses with expected revenue levels and cash flow, and may decide to sell certain non-strategic assets or implement other strategic initiatives to generate proceeds that would be available for debt repayment. Certain of our debt agreements contain financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios. If we are unable to maintain these ratios, we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders          30      [Table of Contents]   would grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all. While our credit ratings are currently investment grade, our Moody’s and S&P ratings outlooks are currently negative. Our inability to maintain our investment grade credit ratings could make it more expensive for us to borrow funds or issue debt securities in the public capital markets on terms reasonably acceptable to us.   Our future growth is dependent upon the development of new products, which requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals, all of which are very expensive and time-consuming and may not result in a commercially viable product.    In order to develop new products and improve current product offerings, we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions, particularly in our drug-eluting stent and CRM programs. We expect to launch our TAXUS® Liberté™ coronary stent system in the U.S., subject to regulatory approval. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in our CRM technologies, including our LATITUDE® Patient Management System and the Frontier™ CRM technology. If we are unable to develop and launch these and other products as anticipated, our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the drug-eluting stent and CRM markets may be adversely impacted.    Further, we expect to invest selectively in areas outside of drug-eluting stent and CRM technologies. There can be no assurance that these or other technologies will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of these technologies or our decision to reduce funding of these projects may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growth.    As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance from the FDA for new products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the market’s perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals from the FDA, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.   We face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.    The medical device market is highly competitive. We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors have historically included Johnson & Johnson (including its subsidiary, Cordis Corporation) and Medtronic, Inc. (including its subsidiary, Medtronic AVE, Inc.). Through our acquisition of Guidant, Abbott has become a primary competitor of ours in the interventional cardiology market and St. Jude Medical, Inc. has become a competitor of ours in the CRM market and in the Neuromodulation market. In addition, we face competition from a wide range of companies that sell a single or a limited number of competitive products or which participate only in a specific market segment, as well as from non-medical device companies, including pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our products.    Additionally, the medical device market is characterized by extensive research and development, and rapid technological change. Developments by other companies of new or improved products,          31      [Table of Contents]   processes or technologies, in particular in the drug-eluting stent and CRM markets, may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our revenues. We are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, attract and retain skilled development personnel, obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products, obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards. If we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.    Because we derive a significant amount of our revenues from international operations and a significant percentage of our future growth is expected to come from international operations, changes in international economic or regulatory conditions could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.    Sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 38 percent of our net sales in 2006. Additionally, a significant percentage of our future growth is expected to come from international operations. As a result, our sales growth and profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions, foreign currency fluctuations, exchange rate fluctuations, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, competitive offerings, infrastructure development, rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy. Further, international markets are also being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs. The trend in countries around the world, including Japan, toward more stringent regulatory requirements for product clearance, changing reimbursement models and more rigorous inspection and enforcement activities has generally caused or may cause medical device manufacturers to experience more uncertainty, delay, risk and expense. In addition, we are required to renew regulatory approvals and obtain exportation certificates to foreign governments in order to market our products in certain international jurisdictions, which may require additional testing and documentation. These approvals and certificates have been impacted by the FDA warning letters we have received. If sufficient resources are not available to renew these approvals or these approvals are not timely renewed, our ability to market our full line of existing products within these jurisdictions may be limited. Any significant changes in the competitive, political, legal, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.    Healthcare cost containment pressures and legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices of third-party payors or preferences for alternate therapies could decrease the demand for our products, the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures performed using our devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.    Our products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians, which typically bill various third-party payors, including governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies. The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and services. After we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors. Further legislative or administrative          32      [Table of Contents]   reforms to the U.S. or international reimbursement systems in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.    Major third-party payors for hospital services in the U.S. and abroad continue to work to contain healthcare costs. The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed and has shifted services between inpatient and outpatient settings. Initiatives to limit the increase of healthcare costs, including price regulation, are also underway in several countries in which we do business. Hospitals or physicians may respond to these cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies for our products. In light of the Guidant product recalls, third-party payors may seek claims and further recourse against us for the recalled defibrillator and pacemaker systems for which Guidant had previously received reimbursement.    Consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our significant market segments, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.    The cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, including hospitals. This in turn has resulted in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors, which may reduce competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.    We rely on external manufacturers to supply us with materials and components used in our products and any disruption of such sources of supply could adversely impact our production efforts.   We vertically integrate operations where integration provides significant cost, supply or quality benefits. However, we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products, some of which are custom made. Certain supplies are purchased from single-sources due to quality considerations, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. We may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for certain components or materials in a timely manner largely due to the complex nature of our and many of our suppliers’ manufacturing processes. Production issues, including capacity constraint; quality issues affecting us or our suppliers; an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required; or a significant increase in the price of materials or components could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.         33      [Table of Contents]   ITEM 1B.
