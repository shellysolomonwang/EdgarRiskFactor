Item 1A. Risk Factors; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements  In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company. It is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.  We make certain forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K, and company spokespersons may make such statements in the future. Where possible, we try to identify forward-looking statements by using such words as “expect,” “plan,” “will,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “believe,” and “anticipate”. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They are likely to address our growth strategy, sales of current and anticipated products, financial results, our research and development programs, the status of product approvals, legislative and regulatory developments, and the outcome of contingencies such as litigation and investigations. All forward-looking statements are based on our expectations at the time we make them. They are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those summarized below.        •    Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. There is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market typically takes a decade or more and costs over $1 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. As a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Delays and uncertainties in the FDA approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In recent years, FDA review times have increased substantially and fewer new drugs are being approved. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict sales growth rates of new products.        •    We face intense competition. We compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and generic pharmaceutical companies. To compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. Our product sales can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic versions of our branded products, and by generic versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. See Item 1, “Business—Competition,” for more details.        •    Our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection. Our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover, develop, and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products. Without strong intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market.  Intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time. In the U.S., the Hatch-Waxman Act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our patents; as a result, we expect that our U.S. patents on major products will be routinely challenged, and there can be no assurance that our patents will be upheld. See Item 1, “Business—Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Protection,” for more details. We are increasingly facing generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the U.S. as well. In addition, competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. If successful, such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. See Item 1, “Business—Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Protection,” for more details.    11        •    We depend on patent-protected products for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings, and we will lose effective intellectual property protection for many of them in the next several years. Eight significant products, which together comprised 74 percent of our worldwide revenue in 2010, have lost or will lose their most significant remaining U.S. patent protection and data-based exclusivity, as well as their intellectual property-based exclusivity in most countries outside the U.S., in the next several years:                      Product        Worldwide Revenues(2010)          Percent of Total 2010Revenues        Loss of Relevant U.S. Exclusivity               Zyprexa      $5.03 billion         22       October 2011               Cymbalta      $3.46 billion         15       2013               Alimta      $2.21 billion         10       2017 (compound patent plus data-based pediatric exclusivity); 2022 (concomitant nutritional supplement use)               Humalog      $2.05 billion         9       2013               Cialis      $1.70 billion         7       2017               Gemzar      $1.15 billion         5       November 2010 (compound); 2013 (use)1               Evista      $1.02 billion         4       2014               Strattera       $576.7 million           2       20161     1  The Gemzar use patent has been held invalid by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and we are seeking review of that decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Strattera patent has been held invalid by a U.S. District Court, and we have appealed that decision; in the meantime, an injunction prevents the launch of generic forms of Strattera. For more information, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Legal and Regulatory Matters.”      Loss of exclusivity, whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation, typically results in a rapid and severe decline in sales. See Item 1, “Business—Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Protection,” for more details.        •    Our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other health care cost containment measures. Government health care cost-containment measures can significantly affect our sales and profitability. In many countries outside the United States, government agencies strictly control, directly or indirectly, the prices at which our products are sold. In the United States, we are subject to substantial pricing pressures from state Medicaid programs and private insurance programs and pharmacy benefit managers, including those operating under the Medicare Part D pharmaceutical benefit, and implementation of the recently-enacted U.S. health care reform legislation is increasing these pricing pressures. In addition, many state legislative proposals would further negatively affect our pricing and/or reimbursement for our products. We expect pricing pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the United States to become more severe. See Item I, “Business—Regulations Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement,” for more details.        •    Pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns. Unexpected safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to marketed products, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as costly product liability claims.        •    Regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company. The marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to extensive regulation. Many companies, including Lilly, have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, private payers and consumers. These claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. It is possible other products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies. In particular, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Legal and Regulatory Matters,” for the discussions of the U.S. sales and marketing practices investigations. In addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures, interruption of production leading to product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the cGMP issues. We are now operating under a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that requires us to maintain comprehensive compliance programs governing our research, manufacturing, and sales and marketing of pharmaceuticals. A material failure to comply with the Agreement could result in severe sanctions to the company. See Item 1, “Business—Regulation of our Operations,” for more details.    12        •    We face many product liability claims today, and future claims will be largely self-insured. We are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving primarily Byetta, Zyprexa, diethylstilbestrol (DES), and thimerosal, and because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the future. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Legal and Regulatory Matters,” and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” for more information on our current product liability litigation. Due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we have been and will continue to be largely self-insured for future product liability losses for substantially all our currently marketed products. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims.        •    Manufacturing difficulties could lead to product supply problems. Pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. Manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities, or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, could result in product shortages, leading to lost sales. See Item 1, “Business—Raw Materials and Product Supply,” for more details.        •    A prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our business and operating results. While pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles, a prolonged economic downturn coupled with rising unemployment (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population) could lead to decreased utilization of drugs, affecting our sales volume. Declining tax revenues attributable to the downturn are increasing the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending, leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization. In addition, a prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our investment portfolio, which could lead to the recognition of losses on our corporate investments and increased benefit expense related to our pension obligations. Also, if our customers, suppliers or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners.        •    We face other risks to our business and operating results. Our business is subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties, including:      —    Economic factors over which we have no control, including changes in inflation, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates, can affect our results of operations.      —    Changes in tax laws, including laws related to the remittance of foreign earnings or investments in foreign countries with favorable tax rates, and settlements of federal, state, and foreign tax audits, can affect our results of operations. In its budget submission to Congress in February 2010, the Obama Administration proposed changes to the manner in which the U.S. would tax the international income of U.S.-based companies. Some provisions changing taxation of international income were enacted in August 2010, which did not have a material effect on results of operations. While it is uncertain how the U.S. Congress may address U.S. tax policy matters in the future, reform of U.S. taxation, including taxation of international income, continues to be a topic of discussion for the U.S. Congress and the Administration. A significant change to the U.S. tax system, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.      —    Changes in accounting standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission can affect our financial statements.      —    Our financial statements can also be affected by internal factors, such as changes in business strategies and the impact of restructurings, asset impairments, technology acquisition and disposition transactions, and business combinations.  We undertake no duty to update forward-looking statements.      Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
