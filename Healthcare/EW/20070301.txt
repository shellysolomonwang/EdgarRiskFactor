Item 1A. Risk Factors    An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of these events or circumstances occurs, Edwards Lifesciences' business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed. In that case, the value of Edwards Lifesciences' securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment. If Edwards Lifesciences does not introduce new products in a timely manner, its products may become obsolete and its operating results may suffer.   The cardiovascular products industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, Edwards Lifesciences' products will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer. Even if Edwards Lifesciences is able to develop new technologies, these technologies may not be accepted quickly because of industry specific factors, such as the need for regulatory clearance, unanticipated restrictions imposed on  11       approved indications, entrenched patterns of clinical practice and uncertainty over third party reimbursement.   Moreover, significant technical innovations generally will require substantial time and investment before Edwards Lifesciences can determine the commercial viability of these innovations. Edwards Lifesciences may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these technical innovations. In addition, even if Edwards Lifesciences is able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of its products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by Edwards Lifesciences' competitors of products embodying newer technologies or features.  Edwards Lifesciences may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect its operating results.   Edwards Lifesciences' business exposes it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. Edwards Lifesciences' products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients. In addition, some of the medical devices manufactured and sold by Edwards Lifesciences are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time. Component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, patients. The occurrence of such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls in the future, which, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' business and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. Edwards Lifesciences may incur charges related to such matters in excess of established reserves and which could have a material adverse impact on Edwards Lifesciences' net income or net cash flows.  Edwards Lifesciences may experience supply interruptions that could harm its ability to manufacture products.   Edwards Lifesciences uses a diverse and broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of its products. Edwards Lifesciences' heart valve therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and man-made materials. Edwards Lifesciences' non-implantable products are manufactured from man-made raw materials including resins, chemicals, electronics and metals. Edwards Lifesciences purchases certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of its products from external suppliers. In addition, Edwards Lifesciences purchases certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, cost-effectiveness, availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. While Edwards Lifesciences works closely with its suppliers to assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability, these efforts may not be successful. In addition, due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the U.S. FDA regarding the manufacture of the Company's products, Edwards Lifesciences may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. Although alternative supplier options are considered and identified, Edwards Lifesciences does not typically pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of its existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with this regulatory process. Although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by Edwards Lifesciences in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of its products or incorporate unique technology, management does not  12       believe that the loss of any existing supply contract would have a material adverse effect on the Company.   In an effort to reduce potential product liability exposure, certain suppliers have announced in the past that they might limit or terminate sales of certain materials and parts to companies that manufacture implantable medical devices. If Edwards Lifesciences is unable to obtain these raw materials or if there is a significant increase in the price of these materials or components, the Company's business could be harmed.  The manufacture of many of Edwards Lifesciences' products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls. If the Company or one of its suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems, Edwards Lifesciences' business could suffer.   The manufacture of many of Edwards Lifesciences' products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls, due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements. In addition, quality is extremely important to the Company, its customers and its customers' patients due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure. Problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow protocols and procedures, raw material problems or human error. If these problems arise or if the Company fails to meet its quality standards, Edwards Lifesciences' reputation could be damaged, the Company could become subject to a recall, product liability and other costs, and the Company's business could otherwise be adversely affected.  Edwards Lifesciences may be required to recognize additional charges in connection with the write-down of some of its investments, the disposition of some of its businesses, the termination of its interest rate swap agreements or for other reasons.   Edwards Lifesciences has investments in the equity instruments of other companies, and may make similar investments in the future. To the extent that the value of any of these investments declines, Edwards Lifesciences may be required to recognize charges to write down the value of that investment. See "Investment Impairments" under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included herein.   At December 31, 2006, Edwards Lifesciences had $20.2 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of $1.4 million on these investments on its consolidated balance sheet in "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss," net of tax.   In addition, Edwards Lifesciences from time to time identifies businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of its business. The Company may seek to dispose of these under-performing businesses or products, and may also seek to dispose of businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons. If Edwards Lifesciences is unable to dispose of a business or product on terms it considers acceptable, Edwards Lifesciences may voluntarily cease providing that product. Any of these events may result in charges, which could be substantial and which could adversely affect its results of operations.   Historically, Edwards Lifesciences has entered into interest rate swap agreements in connection with some of its indebtedness, and expects that it will continue to do so from time to time in the future. In the event that Edwards Lifesciences elects to terminate a swap agreement prior to its maturity, it may be required to make cash payments to the counterparty and to recognize a charge in connection with that termination, which could adversely affect its results of operations.  13      Edwards Lifesciences may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances, and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, require significant management resources and require significant charges or write-downs.   Edwards Lifesciences regularly reviews potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, as well as potential strategic alliances. Edwards Lifesciences may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form partnerships or strategic alliances. Even if Edwards Lifesciences identifies appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates, it may be unable to complete such acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service or product into Edwards Lifesciences' existing business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Integration of an acquired company also may require significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of Edwards Lifesciences' business. Moreover, Edwards Lifesciences may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or strategic alliance, and such transactions may not generate anticipated financial results.   In addition, Edwards Lifesciences may be required to take charges or write downs in connection with acquisitions it has made or may make in the future. In particular, acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to in-process research and development charges, which could be significant. Edwards Lifesciences has taken in-process research and development charges in connection with past acquisitions and may take similar charges in connection with acquisitions the Company makes in the future, which could adversely affect its results of operations.   Future acquisitions could also require issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could impact Edwards Lifesciences' results of operations.  External economic and political factors can have a material adverse affect on Edwards Lifesciences' business.   Many external factors can affect Edwards Lifesciences' profitability and financial condition, such as interest rates, tax rates, general economic conditions and the political environment regarding healthcare in general. For example, an increase in interest rates in the general economy could result in an increase in Edwards Lifesciences' borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict the ability of Edwards Lifesciences to access the capital markets. In addition, there have been and may continue to be proposals by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to keep healthcare costs down. Such legislation, regulatory or payor actions may result in limitations on the prices the Company would be able to charge for its products or the amounts that are reimbursable for its products.  Edwards Lifesciences' business is subject to economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations, including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations.   Because Edwards Lifesciences sells its products in a number of foreign countries, its business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Edwards Lifesciences' net sales originating outside of the United States, as a percentage of total net sales, were 54% in 2006. Edwards  14       Lifesciences anticipates that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of its total sales. In addition, many of Edwards Lifesciences' manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the United States. Management expects to increase Edwards Lifesciences' international sales, which could expose it to greater risks associated with international sales and operations. Accordingly, Edwards Lifesciences future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:    •changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs; •unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements; •changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging regions; •trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; •potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; •difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations; •an outbreak of any life threatening communicable disease; •changes in the international political situation; •differing labor regulations; and •differing protection of intellectual property.    Substantially all of Edwards Lifesciences' sales outside of the United States are denominated in local currencies. Measured in local currency, a substantial portion of Edwards Lifesciences' foreign generated sales was generated in Europe (and primarily denominated in the Euro) and in Japan. The United States dollar value of Edwards Lifesciences' foreign generated sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant decreases in the value of the United States dollar to the Euro or the Japanese yen have had the effect of increasing Edwards Lifesciences' revenues even when the volume of foreign sales has remained constant. Significant increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese yen, as well as other currencies, could have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' revenues and results of operations. Edwards Lifesciences has a hedging program that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on management's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and cost; however, this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.  The stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in Edwards Lifesciences' quarterly operating results as well as other factors may cause its stock price to decline.   From time to time the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect Edwards Lifesciences' stock price, regardless of its operating results. In addition, the market price of Edwards Lifesciences' common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below, as well as a number of other factors, including:    •announcements of innovations, new products, strategic developments or business combinations by Edwards Lifesciences or its competitors;   15          •changes in Edwards Lifesciences' expected operating expense levels or income and losses; •changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts; •the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to Edwards Lifesciences; and •changes in general conditions in the economy, the financial markets, the domestic or international political situation or the medical device industry.    Edwards Lifesciences' sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. A high proportion of Edwards Lifesciences' costs are fixed, due in part to significant sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter, and the price of Edwards Lifesciences' common stock may fall. Other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include:    •demand for and clinical acceptance of products; •the timing and execution of customer contracts, particularly large contracts that would materially affect Edwards Lifesciences' operating results in a given quarter; •the timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products; •the timing of regulatory approvals; •changes in foreign currency exchange rates; •delays or problems in introducing new products; •competitors' introductions of new products, services or technological innovations; •changes in Edwards Lifesciences' pricing policies or the pricing policies of its competitors; •increased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing, raw materials or supplies, product development or administration; •changes in the level of economic activity in the United States or other major regions in which Edwards Lifesciences does business; •costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses; •Edwards Lifesciences' ability to expand its operations; and •the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of Edwards Lifesciences' operations.    Edwards Lifesciences' inability to protect its intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on its business.   Edwards Lifesciences' success and competitive position are dependent, in part, upon its proprietary intellectual property. Edwards Lifesciences relies on a combination of patents, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect its proprietary intellectual property, and will continue to do so. Although Edwards Lifesciences seeks to protect its proprietary rights through a variety of means, Edwards Lifesciences cannot guarantee that the protective steps it has taken are adequate to protect these rights. Patents issued to or licensed by Edwards Lifesciences in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid. In addition, certain of Edwards Lifesciences' patents are due to expire within the next five years and the Company may be unsuccessful in its efforts to extend its protection  16       through improvement patents, modifications or line extensions. The failure to maintain or extend Edwards Lifesciences' patents could have a material adverse effect on the Company.   Edwards Lifesciences also relies on confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements could be breached and Edwards Lifesciences may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to Edwards Lifesciences' trade secrets or proprietary information.   Edwards Lifesciences spends significant resources to monitor and enforce its intellectual property rights, resulting, from time to time, in litigation, and intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and time consuming. However, the Company's efforts in this regard may not be successful. Edwards Lifesciences may not be able to detect infringement and may lose its competitive position in the industry. In addition, competitors may design around Edwards Lifesciences' technology or develop competing technologies. Patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. The invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits that may be filed to protect its intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or prospects.  Third parties may claim Edwards Lifesciences is infringing their intellectual property, and Edwards Lifesciences could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.   During recent years, Edwards Lifesciences' competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry generally. From time to time, Edwards Lifesciences may be forced to defend itself against other claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, and Edwards Lifesciences' intellectual property litigation expenses could be significant. Adverse determinations in any such litigation could subject Edwards Lifesciences to significant liabilities to third parties, or could require Edwards Lifesciences to seek licenses from third parties and could, if such licenses are not available, prevent the Company from manufacturing, selling or using certain of its products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, which could allow its competitors to have access to the same technologies.   Third parties could also obtain patents that may require Edwards Lifesciences to either redesign its products or, if possible, negotiate licenses to conduct its business. If Edwards Lifesciences is unable to redesign its products or obtain a license, Edwards Lifesciences may have to exit a particular product offering.  Edwards Lifesciences faces intense competition within its industry, and if Edwards Lifesciences does not compete effectively, its business will be harmed.   The cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive. Edwards Lifesciences competes with many companies, some of which have longer operating histories, better brand or name recognition, broader product lines and greater access to financial and other resources than Edwards Lifesciences. Furthermore, the industry is characterized by intensive development efforts and rapidly advancing technology. Edwards Lifesciences' present and future products could be rendered obsolete or  17       uneconomical by technological advances made by one or more of its current or future competitors or by alternative therapies, including drug therapies. See "Business-Competition" included herein. Edwards Lifesciences' future success will depend, in large part, on its ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies, anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies.  Consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' revenues and results of operations.   The healthcare industry has been consolidating and, as a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex and tend to involve more long-term contracts. The enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure on product pricing. As an example, many existing and potential domestic customers for Edwards Lifesciences' products have combined to form group purchasing organizations ("GPOs"). GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to members of GPOs. If Edwards Lifesciences is not one of the providers selected by a GPO, it may be precluded from making sales to members of a GPO. Even if Edwards Lifesciences is one of the selected providers, it may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies. Further, Edwards Lifesciences may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on its revenues and profit margins, business, financial condition and results of operations.  Edwards Lifesciences and its customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and Edwards Lifesciences may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop its products to be compatible with these regulations.   The medical devices manufactured and marketed by Edwards Lifesciences are subject to rigorous regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, including regulations that cover the composition, labeling, testing, clinical study, manufacturing, packaging and distribution of our products. Edwards Lifesciences is required to register with the FDA as a device manufacturer and as a result, is subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require Edwards Lifesciences to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. In the European Community, Edwards Lifesciences is required to maintain certain International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") certifications in order to sell products and the Company undergoes periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. If the Company or its suppliers fail to adhere to QSR or ISO requirements, this could delay product production and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls or other consequences, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.  18        Medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed, and the FDA may required testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized, and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of post-marketing programs. Furthermore, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental authorities, can be costly and time consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs, which could have material adverse effects on Edwards Lifesciences' business or results of operations. At any time after approval of a product, the FDA may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with both the FDA's QSR requirements and/or current medical device reporting regulations. Product approvals by the FDA can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval.   In recent years, both the FDA and foreign government regulators have become increasingly rigorous, and Edwards Lifesciences may be subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future. Whenever the FDA or another foreign governmental authority concludes that Edwards Lifesciences is not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the FDA or such other foreign governmental authority, as applicable, can impose fines or delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, institute proceedings to detain or seize Edwards Lifesciences' products, issue a recall, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against Edwards Lifesciences, its officers or its employees and can recommend criminal prosecution to the Department of Justice. Moreover, the FDA or some other foreign governmental authority can proceed to ban, or request recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of, any device or product manufactured or distributed by Edwards Lifesciences. Any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' financial condition, results of operations and prospects.   As previously announced, in February 2007, the Los Angeles District Office of the FDA issued a Warning Letter to the Company resulting from the FDA's inspection of the Company's facility in Irvine, California that concluded in August 2006. The Warning Letter relates specifically to elements of the Company's quality systems, including complaint handling, documentation and quality systems training. The Warning Letter states that until the Company resolves the outstanding issues covered by the Warning Letter, the Company will not receive premarket approvals for devices that are reasonably related to those issues. The Company is committed to continuously improving its quality systems and to resolving the issues that are the subject of the Warning Letter as promptly as possible. However, there can be no assurance that Edwards Lifesciences is or will continue to be in compliance with applicable FDA and other material regulatory requirements.  Unsuccessful clinical trials or developmental procedures relating to products and development could have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' prospects.   The development of new products by Edwards Lifesciences requires extensive clinical trials and procedures. Such clinical trials are inherently risky and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be successful or completed in a timely or cost effective manner. Failure to successfully  19       complete these trials or procedures in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company's prospects. In addition, results from the Company's clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience. If current results for a Company product cannot be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience, the Company's business could be adversely affected.  Edwards Lifesciences is subject to risks arising from concerns and/or regulatory actions relating to "mad cow disease."   Certain of Edwards Lifesciences' products, including pericardial tissue valves, are manufactured using bovine tissue. Concerns relating to the potential transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("BSE"), commonly known as "mad cow disease," from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of bovine products. Certain medical device regulatory agencies have begun to consider whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material. Edwards Lifesciences obtains its bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the United States and Australia. To date, there have been only isolated reported cases in the United States. The bovine tissue used in Edwards Lifesciences' pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected BSE infectious agent. Edwards Lifesciences has not experienced any significant adverse impact on its sales as a result of concerns regarding BSE, but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future.  If third party payors decline to reimburse Edwards Lifesciences' customers for its products or reduce reimbursement levels, Edwards Lifesciences' ability to profitably sell its products will be harmed.   Edwards Lifesciences sells its products and technologies to hospitals, doctors and other health care providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to its patients from third party payors, such as government programs (both domestic and international), private insurance plans and managed care programs. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies. The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products.   Third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. There can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement, if any, will not be decreased in the future, or that future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of Edwards Lifesciences' products. The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed. Hospitals or physicians may respond to such cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies for Edwards Lifesciences' products.   Initiatives to limit growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, are underway in several countries around the world. In Japan, customers are reimbursed for Edwards Lifesciences' products under a government-operated insurance system. Under this system, the Japanese government annually reviews the reimbursement levels for products. The Japanese government is also considering other reimbursement regulation. If the Japanese government decides to reduce reimbursement levels for Edwards Lifesciences products, its product pricing may be adversely affected.  20          Third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by such third party payors, or was used for an unapproved indication. Third party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices. Edwards Lifesciences believes that many of its existing and future products are cost-effective because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time. Edwards Lifesciences cannot be certain whether these third party payors will recognize these cost savings or will merely focus on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies. If Edwards Lifesciences' products are not considered cost-effective by third party payors, Edwards Lifesciences' customers may not be reimbursed for its products.   Edwards Lifesciences is also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare pricing and fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs.
