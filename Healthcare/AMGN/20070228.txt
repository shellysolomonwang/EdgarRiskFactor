Item 1A. Risk Factors — We may not be able to develop commercial products.”  We have substantially expanded our R&D capabilities and plan to continue increasing our investments to expand these capabilities over the next several years. In 2006, R&D expense increased 45% primarily due to higher staff levels and increased funding necessary to support clinical trials for our late-stage programs, which include denosumab, our late-stage investigational product for osteoporosis and metastatic bone cancer, and the continued expansion of our research and pre-clinical organization to build the capacity to advance more compounds into and through the clinic. We began nine “mega-site” trials (involving 200 or more sites) in 2006 to support denosumab and our other late-stage programs. For 2007, we expect R&D expense to increase, although not to the extent experienced in 2006, due to the continuation of the nine mega-site trials previously started in 2006, additional studies beginning in 2007 in support of our late-stage programs, including studies for panitumumab and motesanib diphosphate, and advancing a number of additional molecules into phase 2. The nine “mega-site” trials, which we began in 2006, will continue to require significant time, resources and expense to execute.  To execute our large clinical trial programs, we need to continue to grow our development organization and associated R&D support organizations, implement new management structures and approaches and continue to partner with third-party contract clinical trial providers. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we partnered with third-party clinical providers to open clinical sites and enrolled patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, Mexico and some South American countries. In 2007, we plan to expand into Southeast Asia and India. We are conducting clinical trial activities in these new territories through both our staff and third-party contract clinical trial providers. We expect the growth of our development organization to continue in 2007 although not to the extent experienced in 2006. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.”  We have major R&D facilities in the United States as well as small research centers in Germany and Canada, and development facilities in Europe, Canada, Australia and Japan and as of the fourth quarter of 2006 in Mexico and the United Kingdom. (see “Item 2. Properties”). In addition, we expect to continue expanding our existing R&D sites and to have clinical development staff in Hong Kong and India as of the first quarter of 2007. We are also planning to expand R&D capabilities at our Seattle, Washington and San Francisco, California sites to leverage existing facilities and infrastructure and to fully avail ourselves of the pool of qualified scientific personnel in the surrounding areas. Planned facilities will include a combination of lab and office space.  R&D expenses for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $3,366 million, $2,314 million and $2,028 million, respectively. In 2006, we recorded $130 million and $1,101 million for the write-off of acquired in-process R&D (“IPR&D”) resulting from the Avidia and Abgenix acquisitions, respectively, and in 2004 we recorded $554 million for the write-off of acquired IPR&D resulting from the Tularik Inc. (“Tularik”) acquisition (see Note 7, “Acquisitions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements).    10    Table of Contents The following table is a selection of certain of our product candidates in our therapeutic areas of focus and shows the status of these molecules as of January 25, 2007.

Phase 1 clinical trials investigate safety and proper dose ranges of a product candidate in a small number of human subjects.        Phase 2 clinical trials investigate side effect profiles and efficacy of a product candidate in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.        Phase 3 clinical trials investigate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.    11    Table of Contents The following paragraphs provide additional information about certain of our product candidates that are in phase 2 or later human clinical trials.  Denosumab  Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (“RANKL”), a key mediator of the resorptive phase of bone remodeling. Denosumab is being studied across a range of conditions, including osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, rheumatoid arthritis, bone metastases and multiple myeloma.  Currently, we are conducting a number of phase 3 studies of denosumab in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. In 2006, we initiated two phase 3 studies. The first will compare the efficacy of treatment with denosumab versus alendronate in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density and the second will evaluate the safety and efficacy of transitioning postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density from alendronate to denosumab compared to continuing with alendronate.  Denosumab is also being studied in metastatic bone disease for the treatment of bone metastases to prevent skeletal related events (“SREs”) and prevention of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer. Three phase 3 clinical studies targeting SREs (breast cancer, prostate cancer and solid tumors studies) were initiated in 2006. In addition, we commenced a phase 3 trial for prevention of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer. In 2007, we expect to see the first data sets from our registration-enabling phase 3 studies of denosumab in postmenopausal osteoporosis as well as hormone ablation-associated bone loss.  Vectibix™ (panitumumab)  Panitumumab targets the EGFr. The EGFr pathway is important in normal and tumor cell growth. Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against EGFr and is being evaluated for the treatment of various types of cancer (solid tumor). A pivotal phase 3 study examining panitumumab monotherapy against the standard of care showed that panitumumab significantly prolongs progression-free survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (“CRC”).  Enrollment was completed in 2006 for a non-registrational phase 3b study to evaluate panitumumab plus Avastin® (bevacizumab) in first-line metastatic CRC (Panitumumab Advanced Colorectal Cancer Evaluation (“PACCE”)). The primary endpoint of this study is progression-free survival, with secondary endpoints of response rate, overall survival and safety. An interim (12-week) response-rate analysis was recently performed and response rates in the first 500 patients were similar in the two treatment groups. Additionally, we have informed all investigators and regulatory authorities about safety information arising from this planned interim analysis of the PACCE trial. A review of the data by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (“DMC”) showed an increased incidence of diarrhea, dehydration and infection when panitumumab was given in combination with bevacizumab and either irinotecan or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. These are recognized toxicities that are specifically noted in the Vectibix U.S. prescribing information and panitumumab Investigator’s Brochure. The PACCE study is continuing in accordance with the DMC recommendation. We anticipate presenting the results of an interim analysis of safety and efficacy (including progression-free survival after 25 percent of events have accrued) at scientific meetings in the first half of 2007. The risks and benefits of using panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab have yet to be established. Registrational (phase 3) studies in first-line and second-line treatment of metastatic CRC were started in 2006.  Panitumumab is also being studied in the treatment of head and neck cancer, and we intend to study the drug in the adjuvant CRC setting. In 2007, we expect to initiate a phase 3 study in metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (“SCCHN”) as well as two phase 2 studies addressing the safety and efficacy of panitumumab in the first-line treatment of locally advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. We also expect to initiate two phase 3 studies in the adjuvant CRC setting. One of these studies will be a co-operative phase 3 study with the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (“NSABP”).    12    Table of Contents Panitumumab is also being studied in combination with motesanib diphosphate (AMG 706) in the treatment of various solid tumors. Phase 1b combination studies in CRC, non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) and SCCHN are ongoing.  Motesanib diphosphate (formerly known as AMG 706)  Motesanib diphosphate is a highly selective, oral agent that is being evaluated for its ability to inhibit angiogenesis by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3 (“VEGFR1-3”). It is also under investigation for its potential direct anti-tumor activity by targeting platelet-derived growth factor receptor (“PDGFR”) and stem cell factor receptor (“c-kit”) signaling, which may also confer direct anti-tumor activity.  A phase 2 clinical study evaluating motesanib diphosphate monotherapy in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (“GIST”) showed encouraging clinical activity. A phase 2 trial in advanced thyroid cancer has completed enrollment and recent six-month data showed that motesanib diphosphate was clearly active in this setting, as judged by response rate criteria.  Both cholecystitis and enlargement of the gall bladder have been observed in patients who had received motesanib diphosphate. We continue to study this issue. Based on data gathered to this point, we believe these events are manageable. We intend to review data with regulatory agencies in the coming months. Ongoing studies have continued, subject to protocol amendments to ensure that physicians are aware of the need to manage gall bladder enlargement or cholecystitis, should these occur.  Because of increasing comfort with the safety profile of motesanib diphosphate, we have re-launched a head-to-head phase 2 study of this agent versus Avastin® in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. A second head-to-head phase 2 study against Avastin® in NSCLC is now under way. Additionally, we plan to conduct a new phase 3 study in NSCLC, which is expected to initiate in the second half of 2007.  Motesanib diphosphate is also being investigated in combination with multiple chemotherapy regimens, with and without panitumumab, in the treatment of solid tumors. Phase 1b combination studies in CRC, NSCLC and other solid tumors are ongoing.  AMG 531  AMG 531 is a protein called a peptibody, which is a first-in-class molecule. The active peptide component stimulates the thrombopoietin (“TPO”) receptor resulting in increased platelet production. It is being investigated for the treatment of immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (“ITP”). ITP is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by an abnormal decrease in platelets, a condition known as thrombocytopenia. Platelets are specialized blood cells that help prevent and stop bleeding by participating in clotting. ITP is characterized by thrombocytopenia that results in bruising and bleeding that is sometimes severe.  Two phase 3 clinical studies evaluating AMG 531 in the treatment of ITP were completed in 2006. In the first of these studies, patients with ITP despite prior splenectomy were randomized to receive either placebo or AMG 531 over a 6 month period. Review of the data from this study revealed a favorable efficacy and safety profile, with all clinical endpoints successfully met. We expect to review data from a second phase 3 study in pre-splenectomy ITP patients during the first quarter of 2007. Pending positive results from this study, we expect to file for approval of AMG 531 in the ITP indication in both the U.S. and Europe in 2007. We have previously received fast track designation for ITP from the U.S. FDA.  We are also evaluating AMG 531 in chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (“CIT”) and myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”). Phase 2 studies in each setting were initiated in 2006.  AMG 108  AMG 108 is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of interleukin-1 (“IL-1”), a cytokine known to play a role in the joint destruction associated with rheumatoid arthritis. A phase 2 clinical study is under way to investigate the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with AMG 108.    13    Table of Contents Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa)  In 2006, we announced phase 2 data reporting the clinical effects of darbepoetin alfa compared to placebo in subjects with heart failure and anemia. Based on this data, we opened the Reduction in Events with Darbepoetin alfa in Heart Failure Trial (“RED-HF™”) for enrollment in mid-2006. The RED-HF™ Trial is a large (3,400 subjects), global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study to evaluate the effect of treatment of anemia with darbepoetin alfa on morbidity and mortality in patients with symptomatic left ventricular heart failure.  The Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp® Therapy (“TREAT”) is an approximately 4,000-patient, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial designed to determine the impact of anemia therapy with darbepoetin alfa on mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients with CKD and type 2 (insulin-resistant) diabetes.  In December 2005, we submitted a biologics license supplement to the FDA for a darbepoetin alfa once-monthly dosing regimen and a once every-two-week dosing regimen for CKD patients with anemia not on dialysis. The FDA has requested additional clinical data for the once-monthly dosing regimen, including an additional clinical study. The FDA has also requested additional label language and clarification of submitted data for the de novo once every-two-week dosing regimen. We are working closely with the FDA to resolve these questions.  We recently completed an initial analysis of our Anemia of Cancer phase 3 study. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of darbepoetin alfa administered every four weeks in patients with active cancer not receiving chemo- or radiation therapy. All patients entering the study had anemia (Hb£ 11 g/dL) in the setting of active cancer (i.e., they were not in remission). These criteria identify a subset of patients with an especially grave prognosis. At the end of 16 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of transfusions in the population receiving placebo injections as opposed to those receiving darbepoetin alfa. There was a statistically significant increased risk of death in the darbepoetin alfa-treated group, however, the overall safety profile did not identify any other unexpected safety concerns. Since this study was not designed as a survival study, an effect of imbalances in potentially important prognostic factors that were present at baseline cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, in this population of patients with active cancer, not in remission and not receiving chemo- or radiation therapy, who have anemia, we concluded that the risk/benefit ratio for darbepoetin alfa use is at best neutral and perhaps negative.  KepivanceTM (palifermin)  Kepivance™ is currently being evaluated to determine its safety and anti-mucositis activity in patients receiving radiation and/or chemotherapy for SCCHN, NSCLC and colon cancer (all phase 2 studies).  Sensipar® (cinacalcet HCl)  Cinacalcet HCl is approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD on dialysis. A phase 3 clinical trial has been initiated to assess the effects of cinacalcet HCl on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with CKD undergoing maintenance dialysis.  We recently completed an investigational phase 3 study to determine the safety and efficacy of cinacalcet HCl for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3 & 4 (CKD not on dialysis). We have elected not to file for the expanded indication of cinacalcet HCl in this setting. In the phase 3 trial, all efficacy endpoints were positive, supporting the ability of cinacalcet HCl to reduce parathyroid hormone levels in these patients. However, the incidence of asymptomatic hypocalcemia in cinacalcet HCl-treated patients was felt to be incompatible with routine use of cinacalcet HCl in this setting. Additional analyses are underway which may permit the identification of a dosing regimen that would allow the use of cinacalcet HCl in this patient group.    14    Table of Contents  Competition  Competition among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other companies that research, develop, manufacture or market biologics and pharmaceuticals is intense and the environment we operate in is increasingly competitive. We compete with these entities in all areas of our business including competing to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and operational personnel. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.”)  Our products’ competitive position among other biologic and pharmaceutical products may be based on, among other things, patent position, product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, patient convenience/delivery devices, price and reimbursement. We remain committed to vigorously defending our intellectual property and growing our businesses as well as maintaining or increasing share. For example, the anemia area represents a significant and growing business opportunity. As such, we expect to face increasingly intense competition in this area, including new and existing technologies and competitive pressures associated with biosimilar and other products (see further discussion below). We are committed to growing our anemia business and maintaining our leadership in anemia management, which includes impacting patient health outcomes and supporting the development of new standards of care, exploring new technologies in anemia therapy, preparing to compete with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (“Roche”) in the U.S. and with biosimilar and other competing products in Europe and defending our intellectual property. Roche is developing a pegylated recombinant human erythropoietin (“peg-EPO”) for which they have filed a biologic license application (“BLA”) with the FDA and, according to Roche’s public statements, they expect to launch the molecule in the U.S. nephrology segment in 2007 despite our ongoing lawsuit and their acknowledgement of our U.S. erythropoietin patents (see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Roche Matters — Amgen Inc. v. F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., et. al.”).  Certain of our products are expected to face competition in certain geographic areas from biosimilar products. Our principal European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December 12, 2004 and our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expired on August 22, 2006. We believe that as these patents have expired, other companies could receive approval for and market biosimilar products to compete with our products in the European Union (“EU”). (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.”) Although we cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU, we expect that the first biosimilar G-CSF product may be approved in the EU some time in 2007 and could be available shortly thereafter, and that it would compete with Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. While we do not market EPOGEN® in Europe as this right belongs to Johnson & Johnson (through KA), we do market Aranesp® in the EU, which competes with Johnson & Johnson’s EPREX® product, Roche’s NeoRecormon® product and others’ erythropoietin products. We expect that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the EU in 2007 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval. Based on an announcement by Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc (“Shire”), we expect that a competing erythropoietin product, manufactured by Shire, may appear on the market in the EU in 2007. In addition, Roche is developing its peg-EPO product which, upon regulatory approval, we expect they will launch in the EU nephrology segment in 2007. In 2006, the European Medicines Agency (“EMEA”) developed and issued final regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. The final guidelines included clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products including erythropoietins and G-CSFs, which guidance recommends that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct fairly extensive pharmacodynamic, toxicological, clinical safety studies and a pharmacovigilance program. In the United States, there currently is no legal approval pathway for follow-on biologic products. A number of events would need to occur before these products could enter the market, including passage of legislation by Congress to create a new approval pathway and promulgation of associated regulations and guidance by the FDA. (See “Patents and Trademarks.”) Certain of our products face substantial competition from products marketed by large pharmaceutical companies, which may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and human resources than we do. In addition, the introduction of new products or the development of new processes by     15    Table of Contents  competitors or new information about existing products may result in product replacements or price reductions, even for products protected by patents.  Some of our competitors are actively engaged in R&D in areas where we are also performing research and developing product candidates. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is significantly dependent upon the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, contributing to the product’s eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market is expected to be important to our competitive position.  In addition, we compete with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies when entering into collaborative arrangements with companies primarily in the biotechnology industry, research organizations and other entities for the research, development and commercialization of technologies, product candidates and marketed products. Other public and privately owned companies, research organizations, academic institutions and governmental agencies conduct a significant amount of R&D in the biotechnology industry. We face competition in our collaborative arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from these entities. Accordingly, we may have difficulty entering into collaborative arrangements and licensing or acquiring technologies, product candidates and marketed products on acceptable terms.  The following provides additional information on competition related to our principal products and other selected products and product candidates in the therapeutic area(s) in which we market or expect to market them.  Supportive cancer care  Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with chemotherapy could negatively impact product sales for Aranesp®. Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® could face competition in some circumstances from companies marketing or developing treatments for neutropenia associated with chemotherapy, for bone marrow and PBPC transplant patients, and AML.  NEUPOGEN® competes with Neulasta® in the United States and Europe. U.S. and international NEUPOGEN® sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to Neulasta®. However, we believe that most of the conversion in the United States has occurred. In Europe, we have been actively converting NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta®, emphasizing its less frequent dosing requirements as compared to NEUPOGEN®. While conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta® in Europe is still occurring, we believe that this conversion has mainly stabilized.  The following table reflects companies and their currently marketed products that primarily compete with Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® in the United States and internationally in the supportive cancer care segment.

Legal Proceedings — Transkaryotic Therapies and Aventis Litigation”). Astellas Pharma Inc. (“Astellas”)/FibroGen are co-developing an erythropoietic small molecule and Affymax Inc. (“Affymax”) is developing an erythropoietin mimetic for the treatment of anemia.  Nephrology  Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with CKD could negatively impact product sales for Aranesp® and EPOGEN®. In the United States, Aranesp® and EPOGEN® compete with each other, primarily in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinics. Aranesp® competes with Johnson & Johnson in the pre-dialysis setting. The conversion from EPOGEN® to Aranesp® in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinics had stabilized in mid-2006.  Additionally, Aranesp® competes internationally with other companies’ marketed products to treat anemia associated with CKD.

Roche has also announced plans to launch a peg-EPO product for the treatment of anemia in the EU in the nephrology segment in 2007. TKT is also developing a gene-activated erythropoietin for the treatment of anemia (see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Transkaryotic Therapies and Aventis Litigation”). In addition, Astellas/FibroGen are co-developing an erythropoietic small molecule and Affymax is developing an erythropoietin mimetic for the treatment of anemia. A competing erythropoietin product, manufactured by Shire, may appear on the market in the EU in 2007.

If successful, these product candidates will face substantial competition from products currently marketed as well as those under development by other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. For example, the bone loss setting, in which denosumab would compete, is currently comprised of three therapeutic classes: bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators and anabolic agents. Competitive intensity will increase in the bone loss setting with the expected approval of new agents.    18    Table of Contents The following table reflects other companies and their currently marketed products that will primarily compete with denosumab, if approved:             Amgen Product Candidate    Competitor Marketed Product    Potential Competitor  Denosumab   Fosamax®   Merck & Co., Inc.  Denosumab   Actonel®   Procter & Gamble/Aventis  Denosumab   Boniva®   Roche/GlaxoSmithKline  Denosumab   Evista®   Eli Lilly and Company (“Eli Lilly”)  Denosumab   Forteo®   Eli Lilly  Denosumab   Miacalcin®   Novartis  Denosumab   Zometa®   Novartis  Denosumab   Aredia®   Novartis   Manufacturing and Raw Materials  Manufacturing  Our manufacturing operations consist of bulk manufacturing and/or formulation, fill and finish activities which produce Aranesp®, Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN®, Epoetin alfa, ENBREL, Vectibix™ and other products (and product candidates) for both commercial and clinical purposes. Bulk manufacturing includes fermentation and cell culture, which are the processes in which our proteins are produced. The proteins are purified to a high quality and then formulated into a stable form. The fill process puts the formulated bulk protein into the vials or syringes used by patients or those that administer treatment to patients. Finally, in the finish process, our products are packaged for distribution. We operate commercial and clinical manufacturing facilities in several locations throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico (see “Item 2. Properties”). Manufacturing of Sensipar®, our small molecule product, is performed by third-party contractors.  Commercial Bulk Manufacturing  We operate commercial bulk manufacturing facilities in several locations throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico (see “Item 2. Properties”). To keep up with the growing demand of our products, we operate our bulk manufacturing facilities at nearly full capacity. Other than for ENBREL, we perform all of the bulk manufacturing for our proteins.  Commercial quantities of ENBREL produced at our Rhode Island facilities are insufficient to fill the current level of demand for this product. As a result, the Company and Wyeth also have a contract manufacturing agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG (“BI Pharma”) for the production of additional supply of ENBREL. We also have a global supply agreement with Wyeth related to the manufacture, supply, inventory and allocation of bulk supplies of ENBREL. Under this agreement, the Company and Wyeth share the total worldwide bulk supply of ENBREL produced by Amgen’s Rhode Island manufacturing facilities, BI Pharma’s manufacturing facility in Germany and Wyeth’s manufacturing facility in Ireland.  Our supply of ENBREL is significantly dependent on product manufactured by BI Pharma, and, accordingly, we have made significant purchase commitments to BI Pharma (see Note 8, “Commitments and contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Under our supply agreements, BI Pharma has reserved a specified level of production capacity for ENBREL, and we are committed to using at least that level of capacity. We are required to submit a rolling three-year forecast for manufacturing the bulk drug for ENBREL and a rolling forecast for a shorter period for the number of finished vials of ENBREL. We will be responsible for substantial payments to BI Pharma if we fail to use the minimum production capacity that BI Pharma has reserved for ENBREL each calendar year or if the BI Pharma supply agreement is terminated prematurely under specified conditions.  In addition to producing our own commercial quantities of Epoetin alfa, we also supply Epoetin alfa in the United States to Johnson & Johnson under a supply agreement (see “Joint Ventures and Business Relationships — Johnson & Johnson”).    19    Table of Contents Commercial Formulation, Fill and Finish  We operate commercial formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and conduct certain finish activities in the Netherlands (see “Item 2. Properties”). Other than for ENBREL and Vectibix™, we perform all of the formulation, fill and finish activities for our proteins. In addition to the formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL performed by us in Puerto Rico or by BI Pharma for the ENBREL they manufacture and supply to us under the above-noted manufacturing agreement, formulation, finish and fill of a certain portion of ENBREL is also performed by a third-party contract manufacturer.  To keep up with the growing demand for our products, we are operating the Puerto Rico formulation, fill and finish facility at nearly full production capacity. In addition to the above-noted manufacturing activities, our operations in Puerto Rico perform key manufacturing support functions including quality control, process development, procurement and production scheduling. Our global supply of our principal products is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these Puerto Rico facilities (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We formulate, fill and finish substantially all our products at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at this facility, we may not be able to supply these products”).  Clinical Manufacturing  Clinical bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facilities are operated in several locations throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico (see “Item 2. Properties”). Certain clinical finishing is performed in the Netherlands. In addition, we also utilize third-party contract manufacturers to perform manufacturing activities for certain of our clinical products.  Manufacturing Initiatives  We actively manage our inventory supply produced by our manufacturing facilities and the supply produced by our third-party contract manufacturers. Our manufacturing capacity and use of third-party contract manufacturing agreements have increased and are expected to continue to increase to supply the growth in our commercial products and to support our expanding R&D activities (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We have grown rapidly, and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted.”).  In order to maintain adequate supply to keep up with growing demand for our products, mitigate risks associated with the vast majority of our formulation, fill and finish operations located in Puerto Rico and to adequately prepare to launch a number of our late-stage product candidates, we must successfully implement a number of manufacturing projects on schedule, operate our facilities at nearly full production capacity over the next few years, expand our use of third-party contract manufacturers, build inventory of our bulk drug substance and finished products and maintain a state of regulatory compliance. Key manufacturing projects include: 1) construction, qualification and licensure of our new process bulk and formulation, fill and finish plant in Ireland; 2) construction, qualification and licensure of new formulation, fill and finish facilities at our Puerto Rico site; and 3) expansion of existing bulk protein facilities at our Puerto Rico site including the licensure of our Puerto Rico plant for production of Epoetin and darbepoetin bulk drug substance and increased production of pegfilgrastim and Filgrastim bulk drug substance.  Raw Materials  Certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for our commercial manufacturing of our products are proprietary products of other companies, and in some cases, such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with the FDA such that they must be obtained from that specific, unaffiliated sole source. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such sole-sourced raw materials by active inventory management, relationship management and alternate source development, when feasible. We monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers, their ability to supply our needs and the market conditions for these raw materials. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial manufacturing and formulation of our products are derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum     20    Table of Contents  albumin (“HSA”). We are investigating screening procedures with respect to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of biologically-sourced raw materials as these materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall and some countries may restrict the use of them in the manufacture of drugs. Raw materials, medical devices and components may be subject to contamination and/or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction could adversely impact or disrupt the commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We rely on single third-party suppliers for some of our raw materials, medical devices and components; if these third parties fail to supply these items, we may be unable to supply our products.”   Joint Ventures and Business Relationships  From time to time, we may enter into joint ventures and other business relationships to provide additional development, manufacturing and marketing capabilities. In addition to our internal R&D efforts, we have acquired certain product and technology rights and have established R&D collaborations to enhance our R&D capabilities and internally developed product pipeline. Our R&D collaborations generally consist of non-refundable, upfront license fees, R&D and commercial performance milestones, cost sharing, royalties and/or profit sharing. Additionally, these collaborations may include manufacturing and co-promotion arrangements. Our collaboration agreements with third parties are performed on a “best efforts” basis with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success.  Kirin Brewery Company, Limited  We formed KA, a 50-50 joint venture with Kirin in 1984. KA develops and commercializes certain of our and Kirin's technologies, which have been transferred to this joint venture. KA has given exclusive licenses to us to manufacture and market: 1) darbepoetin alfa in the United States, all European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, 2) pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and 3) recombinant human erythropoietin in the United States. We currently market darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, G-CSF and recombinant human erythropoietin under the brand names Aranesp®, Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN® and EPOGEN®, respectively.  KA has also given exclusive licenses to Kirin to manufacture and market: 1) darbepoetin alfa in Japan, the People's Republic of China (“China”), Taiwan, Korea and certain other countries in Southeast Asia, 2) G-CSF and pegfilgrastim in Japan, Taiwan and Korea and 3) recombinant human erythropoietin in Japan. Kirin markets G-CSF and recombinant human erythropoietin in China under a separate agreement with KA. Kirin markets its G-CSF product in its respective territories under the trademark GRAN®. Kirin markets its recombinant human erythropoietin product in Japan under the trademark ESPO®.  KA has licensed to Johnson & Johnson rights to recombinant human erythropoietin in certain geographic areas of the world (see “— Johnson & Johnson”). Under its agreement with KA, Johnson & Johnson pays a royalty to KA based on sales. KA has also licensed to Roche rights to pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in certain geographic areas of the world.  During 2005 certain of our and Kirin’s technologies related to AMG 531 were transferred to KA. In return, KA has given us and Kirin exclusive licenses to manufacture and market AMG 531 in certain territories.  In connection with our various license agreements with KA, we pay KA royalties based on product sales and also receive payment for conducting certain R&D activities on behalf of KA (see Note 3, “Related party transactions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  Johnson & Johnson  We granted Johnson & Johnson a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all markets other than dialysis. In the United States, all recombinant human     21    Table of Contents  erythropoietin sold by Johnson & Johnson is manufactured by us and sold by Johnson & Johnson under the trademark PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa). PROCRIT® brand Epoetin alfa is identical to EPOGEN® brand Epoetin alfa, which is manufactured and sold by us in the U.S. dialysis market. Pursuant to the license agreement with Johnson & Johnson, we earn a 10% royalty on net sales of PROCRIT® by Johnson & Johnson in the United States.  Outside the United States, with the exception of China and Japan, Johnson & Johnson was granted rights to manufacture and commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic for all uses under a licensing agreement with KA. With respect to its sales outside of the United States, Johnson & Johnson manufactures and commercializes its own brand of Epoetin alfa which is then sold throughout the world by Johnson & Johnson under various trademarks such as EPREX® and ERYPO®. We are not involved in the manufacture of Epoetin alfa sold by Johnson & Johnson outside of the United States. (See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Johnson & Johnson Matters — Arbitration/Demand for Separate BLA and — Ortho Biotech Antitrust Litigation.”)  Wyeth  Amgen and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL under a co-promotion agreement in the United States and Canada for all approved indications other than for use in oncology. The rights to detail and promote ENBREL in the United States and Canada for oncology indications are reserved to Amgen. The rights to market ENBREL outside of the United States and Canada are reserved to Wyeth. Under the co-promotion agreement, a management committee comprised of equal representation from Wyeth and Amgen is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL including: strategic planning, the approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing and the establishment of a brand team. The brand team, with equal representation from each party, prepares and implements the annual marketing plan, which includes a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party, and is responsible for all sales activities. Further, pursuant to the co-promotion agreement, Wyeth and Amgen each pay a defined percentage of all selling and marketing expenses approved by the management committee. In addition, we pay Wyeth a percentage of the annual gross profits of ENBREL, which reflect the sharing of manufacturing costs in the United States and Canada attributable to all approved indications for ENBREL on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, we maintain a majority share of ENBREL profits. Under the co-promotion agreement, Wyeth is required to reimburse Amgen for: 1) certain clinical and regulatory expenses we incur in connection with the filing and approval of any new indications for ENBREL in the United States and Canada, excluding oncology and rheumatoid arthritis indications; 2) certain specified patent expenses related to ENBREL; and 3) certain costs, expenses and liabilities associated with the manufacture, use, or sale of ENBREL in the United States and Canada.  We also have a global supply agreement with Wyeth related to the manufacture, supply, inventory and allocation of bulk supplies of ENBREL. Under this agreement, the Company and Wyeth share the total worldwide bulk supply of ENBREL produced by Amgen’s Rhode Island manufacturing facilities, BI Pharma’s manufacturing facility in Germany and Wyeth’s manufacturing facility in Ireland.  Fresenius  In October 2006, we entered into a five-year sole sourcing and supply agreement with an affiliate of Fresenius Medical Care North America, Inc. (“Fresenius”), on its behalf and on behalf of certain of its affiliates, to purchase, and we have agreed to supply, all of Fresenius’ commercial requirements for erythropoietic stimulating proteins for use in managing the anemia of its hemodialysis patients in the United States and Puerto Rico, based on forecasts provided by Fresenius and subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement.   Government Regulation  Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing R&D activities.  In order to clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. In the United States,     22    Table of Contents  the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the raw materials and components used in the production of, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products on a product-by-product basis. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves our expenditure of substantial resources and, after approval, such approval remains costly for us to maintain (see “Item 1a. Risk Factors — Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.”, “We may not be able to develop commercial products.” and “If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.”). After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an investigational new drug application with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake a three-phase human clinical testing program. In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a number of human subjects. In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side effect profiles and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. The time and expense required for us to perform this clinical testing can vary and is substantial. For example, denosumab, our late-stage product candidate, requires large trials that require substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. Historically, our products have required smaller, shorter trials. We cannot take any action to market any new drug or biologic product in the United States until our appropriate marketing application has been approved by the FDA. Even after we have obtained initial FDA approval, we may be required to conduct further clinical trials and provide additional data on safety and effectiveness and are required to gain clearance to market the use of a product as a treatment for indications other than those initially approved. In addition, side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing approval. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on a product’s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. Any adverse event, either before or after marketing approval, can result in product liability claims against us (see “Item 1a. Risk Factors — We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims.”).  In addition to regulating and auditing human clinical trials, the FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of such products prior to providing approval to market a product. If after receiving clearance from the FDA, we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following the initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that our equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations.  In the European countries, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. Additionally, depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval in the EU countries: mutual recognition and the centralized procedure. These review mechanisms may ultimately lead to approval in all EU countries, but each method grants all participating countries some decision-making authority in product approval.  We are also subject to various federal and state laws, as well as foreign laws, pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. The federal government has published regulations that identify “safe harbors” or exemptions for certain arrangements that do not violate the anti-kickback statute. We seek to comply with the safe harbors where possible. Due to the breadth of the     23    Table of Contents  statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). If the government were to allege against or convict us of violating these laws, there could be a material adverse effect on us, including our stock price. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities.  Since 1991, we have participated in the Medicaid rebate program established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and under amendments of that law that became effective in 1993. Participation in this program has included extending comparable discounts under the Public Health Service (“PHS”) pharmaceutical pricing program. Under the Medicaid rebate program, we pay a rebate for each unit of our product reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law as a minimum 15.1% of the AMP of that product, or if it is greater, the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any customer. The rebate amount also includes an inflation adjustment if AMP increases faster than inflation. The PHS pricing program extends discounts comparable to the Medicaid rebate to a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of poor Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The rebate amount is recomputed each quarter based on our reports of our current AMP and best price for each of our products to the CMS. The terms of our participation in the program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates (and interest, if any), if we were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information.  We also make our products available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) of the General Services Administration. Since 1993, as a result of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (the “VHC Act”), federal law has required that product prices for purchases by the Veterans Administration, the Department of Defense, Coast Guard and the PHS (including the Indian Health Service) be discounted by a minimum of 24% off the AMP to non-federal customers (the non-federal average manufacturer price, “non-FAMP”). Our computation and report of non-FAMP is used in establishing the price, and the accuracy of the reported non-FAMP may be audited by the government under applicable federal procurement laws. Among the remedies available to the government for infractions of these laws is recoupment of any overages paid by FSS users during the audited years. In addition, if we were found to have knowingly reported a false non-FAMP, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the VHC Act provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per item that is incorrect.  We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other current and potential future federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations. Our R&D activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. We believe that our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. Our research and manufacturing activities also are conducted in voluntary compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research.  Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign     24    Table of Contents  government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws, rules and/or regulations.  (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.” and “Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”)   Patents and Trademarks  We have filed applications for a number of patents, have been granted patents or have obtained rights relating to our products and various potential products. Our material patents are set forth in the table below.

There can be no assurance that our patents or licensed patents will afford legal protection against competitors or provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantage. In addition, our patents or licensed patents could be held invalid or unenforceable by a court, or infringed or circumvented by others, or others could obtain patents that we would need to license or circumvent. Competitors or potential competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents, and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to proteins, small molecules, compounds or processes competitive with ours. Additionally, for certain of our product candidates, competitors, or potential competitors may claim that their existing or pending patents prevent us from commercializing such product candidates in certain territories. Further, when our patents expire, other companies could develop new competitive products to our products. Our recent European patent expirations could result in new competitive products to our products in Europe. Our principal European patent relating     25    Table of Contents  to erythropoietin expired on December 12, 2004 and our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expired on August 22, 2006. We believe that as these patents have expired, other companies could receive approval for and market follow-on or biosimilar products to compete with these products in the EU; presenting additional competition to our products. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.”) Although we cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU, we expect that the first biosimilar G-CSF product may be approved in the EU some time in 2007 and could be available shortly thereafter, and that it would compete with Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. While we do not market EPOGEN® in Europe as this right belongs to Johnson & Johnson (through KA), we do market Aranesp® in the EU, which competes with Johnson & Johnson’s EPREX® product, Roche’s NeoRecormon® product and others’ erythropoietin products. We expect that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the EU in 2007 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval. Based on an announcement by Shire, we expect that a competing erythropoietin product, manufactured by Shire, may appear on the market in the EU in 2007. In addition, Roche is developing its peg-EPO product which, upon regulatory approval, we expect they will launch in the EU nephrology segment in 2007. In 2006, the EMEA developed and issued final regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. The final guidelines included clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products including erythropoietins and G-CSFs, which guidance recommends that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct fairly extensive pharmacodynamic, toxicological, clinical safety studies and a pharmacovigilance program. In the United States, there currently is no legal approval pathway for follow-on biologics. A number of events would need to occur before these products could enter the market, including passage of legislation by Congress to create a new approval pathway and promulgation of associated regulations and guidance by the FDA. In general, we have obtained licenses from various parties which we deem to be necessary or desirable for the manufacture, use or sale of our products. These licenses generally require us to pay royalties to the parties on product sales. In addition, other companies have filed patent applications or have been granted patents in areas of interest to us. There can be no assurance any licenses required under such patents will be available for license on acceptable terms or at all. We are engaged in various legal proceedings relating to certain of our patents (see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”).  Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require our staff members, material consultants, scientific advisors and parties to collaboration and licensing agreements to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, the consulting relationship, or the collaboration or licensing arrangement with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or obtain access to our information.  (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.”)  (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.”)   Human Resources  As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 20,100 staff members, which includes approximately 100 part-time staff members. Of the total staff members as of December 31, 2006, approximately 8,200 were engaged in R&D, approximately 3,200 were engaged in selling and marketing, approximately 6,600 were engaged in commercial manufacturing activities and approximately 2,100 were engaged in other activities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue attracting and retaining qualified personnel in sufficient numbers to meet our needs. None of our staff members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our staff relations to be good. We expect to hire additional staff members throughout 2007, primarily in manufacturing and R&D.    26    Table of Contents  Executive Officers of the Registrant  The executive officers of the Company as of January 31, 2007 are as follows:  Mr. Kevin W. Sharer, age 58, has served as a director of the Company since November 1992.

Geographic Area Financial Information  For financial information concerning the geographic areas in which we operate, see Note 9, “Segment information — Geographic information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Investor Information  Financial and other information about us is available on our website (http://www.amgen.com) (This website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained in our website is not intended to be a part of this filing). We make available on our website, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material electronically or otherwise furnishing it to the SEC.       Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  This report and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, operations, liquidity and stock price materially and adversely.  If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.  The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. To date, there has emerged no consistent policy regarding breadth of claims allowed in such companies’ patents. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patents that they may claim prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude or delay commercialization of products. We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in patent litigation. However, a patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the product that is alleged to infringe to market and we may be subject to competition during certain periods of litigation. For example, Roche is developing peg-EPO for which they have filed a BLA with the FDA. On November 8, 2005, we filed a lawsuit against Roche for patent infringement of six of our U.S. patents. In addition, on April 11, 2006, we filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) requesting that the ITC institute an investigation of Roche’s importation of peg-EPO. This lawsuit and matter is described in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Roche Matters.” According to Roche’s public statements, they expect to launch the molecule in the U.S. nephrology segment in 2007 despite our ongoing lawsuit and their acknowledgement of our U.S. erythropoietin patents. (See “— Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.”) If we lose or settle current or future litigations     28    Table of Contents  at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities; required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology; or required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.  Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. We have filed applications for a number of patents and have been granted patents or obtained rights relating to erythropoietin, natural and recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, etanercept, cinacalcet HCl, panitumumab and our other products and potential products. We market our erythropoietin, recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, etanercept, cinacalcet HCl and panitumumab products as EPOGEN® (Epoetin alfa), NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim), Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa), Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), Enbrel® (etanercept), Sensipar®/Mimpara® (cinacalcet HCl) and VectibixTM (panitumumab) respectively. With respect to our material patents, we have had a number of G-CSF patent expiries in the United States and one expiry in the EU and one erythropoietin patent expiry in the EU. For additional information on our material patents see “Item 1. Business — Patents and Trademarks.”  We also have been granted or obtained rights to patents in Europe relating to erythropoietin; G-CSF; pegfilgrastim (pegylated G-CSF); etanercept; two relating to darbepoetin alfa; hyperglycosylated erythropoietic proteins; and cinacalcet HCl. Our principal European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December 12, 2004 and our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expired on August 22, 2006. We believe that as these patents have expired, other companies could receive approval for and market follow-on biologics or biosimilar products (as they are generally known in the EU) to compete with these products in the EU; presenting additional competition to our products. (See “— Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.”) Although we cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU, we expect that the first biosimilar G-CSF product may be approved in the EU some time in 2007 and could be available shortly thereafter, and that it would compete with Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. While we do not market EPOGEN® in Europe as this right belongs to Johnson & Johnson (through KA), we do market Aranesp® in the EU, which competes with Johnson & Johnson’s EPREX® product, Roche’s NeoRecormon® product and others’ erythropoietin products. We expect that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the EU in 2007 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval. Based on an announcement by Shire, we expect that a competing erythropoietin product, manufactured by Shire, may appear on the market in the EU in 2007. In addition, Roche is developing its peg-EPO product which, upon regulatory approval, we expect they will launch in the EU nephrology segment in 2007. Although, we cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar products or other competing products would impact future Aranesp®, Neulasta® or NEUPOGEN® sales in the EU, biosimilar products or other products that effectively compete with our products could reduce sales which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations.  In 2006, the EMEA developed and issued final regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. The final guidelines included clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products including erythropoietins and G-CSFs, which guidance recommends that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct fairly extensive pharmacodynamic, toxicological, clinical safety studies and a pharmacovigilance program. In the United States, there currently is no legal approval pathway for follow-on biologics. A number of events would need to occur before these products could enter the market, including passage of legislation by Congress to create a new approval pathway and promulgation of associated regulations and guidance by the FDA. Until such legislation is created, we cannot predict when follow-on biologics could appear in the United States.    29    Table of Contents Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.  Before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials which demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans for the indications sought. The results of these clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain regulatory approval from government authorities such as the FDA. Clinical trials are experiments conducted using our product candidates in human patients having the diseases or medical conditions we are trying to address. Conducting clinical trials is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims we are seeking. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product candidate and therefore, we may spend as much as several years completing certain trials. Our ability to complete our clinical trials in a timely fashion depends in large part on a number of key factors including protocol design, regulatory and institutional review board approval and the rate of patient enrollment in clinical trials. Patient enrollment is a function of several factors, including the size and location of the patient population, enrollment criteria and competition with other clinical trials for eligible patients. As such, there may be limited availability of patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. Delays in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, delays in regulatory approvals and associated delays in product candidates reaching the market.  Patients may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects in the course of our clinical trials that may delay or prohibit regulatory approval of our product candidates or additional indications for our currently approved products, or may render the product candidate commercially infeasible. Additionally, adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others may expand safety labeling for our approved products and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our products, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement of our products. (See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.”; Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”; and “— Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.”) For example, as a result of observing an increased frequency of cholecystitis, inflammation of the gall bladder, in patients treated with our late-stage product candidate motesanib diphosphate, we delayed our phase 3 “mega-site” trial (involving 200 or more sites) in first line non-small cell lung cancer, which was previously expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2006, until the second half of 2007. Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In these diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on an out of date standard of medical care, limiting the utility and application of such trials. Of course, even if we successfully manage our clinical trials, we may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and may not be able to obtain regulatory approval on this basis.  The number, size, duration and complexity of our clinical trials has increased and we expect will continue to increase in 2007. Due to the number of large-scale clinical trials initiated in 2006, we expect to see further growth in R&D expense in 2007, but not to the same extent experienced in 2006. For example, the nine “mega-site” trials which we began in 2006 will continue to require significant time, resources and expense to execute. To execute our clinical trial programs, we need to continue the growth of our development organization and associated R&D support organizations, implement new management structures and approaches and continue to partner with third-party contract clinical trial providers. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we partnered with third-party contract clinical trial providers to open clinical sites and are enrolling patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, Mexico and some South American countries. In 2007, we plan to expand to Southeast Asia and India. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires     30    Table of Contents  substantial time and resources to identify and understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. If we fail to adequately manage the increasing number, size, complexity and regulatory diversity of our clinical trials, our clinical trials and corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our product candidates or are unable to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected materially. Additional information on our clinical trials can be found on our website at (http://www.amgen.com). (This website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing.)  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.  We and certain of our licensors and partners conduct research, preclinical testing and clinical trials for our product candidates. In addition, we manufacture and contract manufacture and certain of our licensors and partners manufacture our product candidates. We also manufacture and contract manufacture, price, sell, distribute and market or co-market our products for their approved indications. These activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, such as the FDA and CMS, as well as in foreign countries, including European countries, Canada, Australia and Japan. Currently, we are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from those countries’ regulatory authorities before we can manufacture (or have our third-party manufacturers produce), market and sell our products in those countries. The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to fail to approve commencement of, suspend or terminate clinical trials, require additional testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval, mandate product withdrawals and require changes in labeling of our products.  In our experience, obtaining regulatory approval is costly and takes many years, and after it is obtained, remains costly to maintain. With the occurrence of a number of high profile safety events with certain pharmaceutical products such as Vioxx and Bextra, regulatory authorities, members of Congress, the Government Accountability Office (“GAO”), medical professionals, including physicians and investigators, and the general public are increasingly concerned about potential or perceived safety issues associated with pharmaceutical and biological products. As a result, clinical trials are receiving greater scrutiny with respect to safety, which may lead to fewer treatments being approved by the FDA. Any safety concerns may result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities terminating clinical trials before completion or requiring longer or additional clinical trials that may result in substantial additional expense. (See “— Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.”)  Adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others may expand safety labeling for our approved products and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our products, regulatory or private health organization medical guidelines and reimbursement for our products. For example, we recently announced an initial analysis of our Anemia of Cancer phase 3 study where Aranesp® was administered to patients with active cancer not receiving chemo- or radiation therapy. All patients entering the study had anemia (Hb£ 11g/dL) in the setting of active cancer (i.e. they were not in remission). This study was designed to establish the effectiveness of Aranesp® in the potential anemia of cancer indication and failed to meet its primary endpoint of reducing red blood cell transfusions in the Aranesp® treatment group. There was a statistically significant increased risk of death with the Aranesp® treated group. In the population of patients with active cancer, not in remission and not receiving chemo- or radiation therapy, who have anemia, we concluded that the risk/benefit ratio for Aranesp® use was at best neutral and perhaps negative and we will not pursue regulatory approval for anemia of cancer at this time. Further, the FDA has notified us that that an Oncology Advisory Committee Meeting (“ODAC”) has been scheduled for May 10, 2007, partially based upon initial data from our Anemia of Cancer study and preliminary data from the third-party investigator Danish Head and Neck Cancer (DAHANCA) 10 Study. It is our understanding that the ODAC meeting will review progress made by us     31    Table of Contents  and others to understand the effects of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (“ESAs”) on survival and tumor progression in cancer patients. In addition, the recent interim analysis of our PACCE study, a non-registration-enabling trial evaluating panitumumab in first- line treatment of metastatic CRC, showed an increased incidence of diarrhea, dehydration and infection when given in combination with bevacizumab and either irinotecan or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. (See “— Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.” and “Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”)  Substantially all of our marketed products are currently approved in the United States and most are approved in Europe and in other foreign countries for specific uses. However, later discovery of unknown problems with our products could result in restrictions on the sale or use of such products, including potential withdrawal of the product from the market. If new medical data suggests an unacceptable safety risk or previously unidentified side-effects, we may voluntarily withdraw, or regulatory authorities may mandate the withdrawal of, such product from the market for some period or permanently. For example, we previously initiated a voluntary recall of the Neulasta® SureClick™ pre-filled pen in Europe because of the potential risk to patients of receiving an incomplete dose and we have previously conducted a voluntary wholesaler recall of a limited number of lots of ENBREL as a result of a small number of reports of missing, detached or loose rubber caps on the needle-less syringe filled with diluent liquid by a third-party contract manufacturer and packaged with the vials of ENBREL. Although there have been no observable adverse event trends associated with the Neulasta® SureClick™ pen or with the reports of missing, detached or loose rubber caps, we may experience the same or other problems in the future resulting in broader product recalls or adverse event trends. Further, regulatory agencies could change existing, or promulgate new, regulations at any time which may affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our existing or future products or require significant additional costs to obtain or maintain such approvals.  If we or others identify side effects before or after any of our products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our products and changes to or re-approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required, any of which could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Certain labels or label changes may be necessary for a number of reasons, including: the identification of actual or theoretical safety or efficacy concerns by regulatory agencies; the discovery of significant problems with a similar product that implicates an entire class of products or subsequent concerns about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying the label. Before any of our products are approved for commercial use, regulatory bodies could decide that the product label include certain warning language as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products. For example, the Vectibix™ prescribing information includes a boxed warning from the FDA on dermatologic toxicities and severe infusion reactions as part of an evolving FDA labeling to the anti-EGFr class. In addition, after any of our products are approved for commercial use, we or regulatory bodies could decide, and have in the past decided, that changes to our product labeling are required. For example, the FDA instituted a class label change for the three recombinant ESAs marketed in the United States. The label change to the class, which included EPOGEN® and Aranesp®, added information about pure red cell aplasia (“PRCA”) to the adverse event profile section to the three ESA product labels in the U.S. Additionally, the New England Journal of Medicine recently published results from Johnson & Johnson’s Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes In Renal Insufficiency (“CHOIR”) study. The CHOIR study, involved non-dialysis patients in whom a hemoglobin target of 13.5 g/dL was established which is meaningfully higher than the FDA-approved target range of 10-12 g/dL described in the ESAs’ labels. In the CHOIR study, patients assigned to the higher 13.5 g/dL hemoglobin target group had worse outcomes than those patients treated to a target hemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dL. We are in discussions with the FDA with respect to all ESA labels and expect that we will add patient safety information in the form of a boxed warning that will apply to both the nephrology and oncology indications for the class of approved ESAs. This language is still in development, discussions with the FDA are on-going, and any label change is subject to FDA approval.  Any significant concerns raised about the safety or efficacy of our products could also result in the need to reformulate those products, to conduct additional clinical trials, to make changes to our manufacturing processes or to seek re-approval of our manufacturing facilities. Significant concerns about the safety and effectiveness of a     32    Table of Contents  product could ultimately lead to the revocation of its marketing approval. The labeling of a new product, a revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above could be required even if there is no clearly established connection between the product and the safety or efficacy concerns that have been raised. If the labeling of a new product, a revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above resulted in decreased use of our products, it could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations.  In addition, if regulatory authorities determine that we or our licensor or partner conducting R&D activities on our behalf have not complied with regulations in the R&D of a product candidate, then they may not approve the product candidate and we will not be able to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.  Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.  In the United States, dialysis providers are primarily reimbursed for EPOGEN® by the federal government through the ESRD Program of Medicare. The ESRD Program reimburses approved providers for 80% of allowed dialysis costs; the remainder is paid by other sources, including patients, state Medicaid programs, private insurance, and to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. The ESRD Program reimbursement rate is established by federal law and is monitored and implemented by CMS. Most patients receiving Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® for approved indications are covered by both government and private payer healthcare programs. Since January 1, 2006, ENBREL and Sensipar® are eligible for coverage from the U.S. government under Medicare Part D. Although both ENBREL and Sensipar® have received broad formulary placement in 2006 and 2007, Part D formulary placements are made by individual Part D plan sponsors with oversight by CMS and are subject to revision in the future. Generally, in Europe and other countries outside the U.S., the government sponsored healthcare system is the primary payer of healthcare costs of patients. Governments may regulate access to, prices or reimbursement levels of our products to control costs. Worldwide use of our products may be affected by these cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce healthcare expenditures. Further, changes in guidelines or recommendations promulgated by government agencies, professional societies, insurance carriers, practice management groups, physicians, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases may negatively impact reimbursement of our products. (See “— Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.”) Therefore, sales of all of our principal products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including governments and private insurance plans.  The MMA was enacted into law in December 2003 and implemented January 1, 2005. Changes resulting from the MMA, which lowered reimbursement for our products, could negatively affect product sales of some of our marketed products however, we believe that our product sales for 2005 and 2006 were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the MMA. We believe this was, in part, due to the effects of CMS’ 2005 and 2006 oncology demonstration projects on sales of our products used in supportive cancer care, especially Aranesp®. However, we believe it is unlikely that CMS will implement an oncology demonstration project for 2007. Furthermore, we believe that our sales for 2005 and 2006 were not significantly impacted, in part, due to increased reimbursement rates to physicians from CMS for services associated with drug administration. The 2006 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Rule reduced payments for physician services in 2006 by approximately 4.4% on average, although subsequent legislation eliminated this reduction for 2006. The Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Rule for 2007 would have reduced payments for physician services in 2007 by approximately 5.0% on average, however, as in 2006, new legislation eliminated the reduction in payments for 2007.  Because we cannot accurately predict the impact of any such changes on how, or under what circumstances, healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products, we cannot estimate the full impact of the MMA on our business, although we believe that it is not likely to be significant to our business in 2007. However, additional provisions of the MMA and other regulations affecting reimbursement that have gone or may go into effect could affect our product sales and related sales growth in the future.    33    Table of Contents The main components of the MMA that affect our currently marketed products are as follows:        •    Through 2004, the AWP mechanism was the basis of Medicare Part B payment for covered outpatient drugs and biologics. Since January 1, 2005, in the physician clinic setting, Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® are being reimbursed under a Medicare Part B payment methodology that reimburses each product at 106% of its ASP (sometimes referred to as “ASP+6%”). ASP is calculated by the manufacturer based on a statutorily defined formula and submitted to CMS. A product’s ASP is calculated on a quarterly basis and therefore may change each quarter. The ASP in effect for a given quarter (the “Current Period”) is based upon certain historical sales and sales incentive data covering a statutorily defined period of time preceding the Current Period. For example, the ASP for Aranesp® that will be in effect for the second quarter of 2007 will be based in part on certain historical sales and sales incentive data for Aranesp® from January 1, 2006 through December 30, 2006. CMS publishes the ASPs for products in advance of the quarter in which they go into effect. The ASPs for Aranesp® and Neulasta® trended downward during the first three quarters of 2005, began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2005 and remained relatively stable in 2006.        •    Since August 1, 2006, physicians in the physician clinic setting have had the choice between purchasing and billing for specific drugs under the ASP+6% system or obtaining those drugs from vendors selected by CMS under the CAP. We believe CAP is unlikely to have a significant impact on our business in 2007.        •    Medicare’s hospital OPPS, which determines payment rates for specified covered outpatient drugs and biologics in the hospital outpatient setting, utilized AWP as the basis for reimbursement in 2005. CMS’ 2005 reimbursement rate, as in 2003 and 2004, continued the application of an “equitable adjustment” such that the 2005 Aranesp® reimbursement rate was based on the AWP of PROCRIT®. For 2005, the reimbursement rate for Aranesp® was 83% of the AWP for PROCRIT®, down from 88% of the AWP for PROCRIT® in 2004, with a dose conversion ratio of 330 U PROCRIT® to 1 mcg Aranesp®, the same ratio as 2004. Effective January 1, 2006, the OPPS system changed from an AWP based reimbursement system to a system based on ASP. This change affected Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® when administered in the hospital outpatient setting. The OPPS rule for 2006 and 2007 based reimbursement for non-pass through products such as Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® on ASP+6% using the same payment amounts as used in the physician clinic setting and did not apply an “equitable adjustment” to tie the reimbursement rate for Aranesp® to PROCRIT® using a dose conversion ratio. CMS noted in the 2005 final rule and has maintained that it reserves the right to apply an “equitable adjustment” to the payment rate for Aranesp® in future years.        •    Pursuant to final rules issued by CMS on November 3, 2004, Medicare reimbursement for EPOGEN® used in the dialysis setting for calendar year 2005 changed from the previous rate in 2004 of $10 per 1,000 Units to $9.76 per 1,000 Units, in 2005, a rate based upon an average acquisition cost for 2003 determined by the OIG and adjusted for price inflation based on the Producer Price Index for pharmaceutical products. Pursuant to the CMS final rules, the difference between the 2004 reimbursement rates for all drugs separately billed outside the dialysis composite rate (including EPOGEN®) and the 2005 reimbursement rates for such drugs was added to the composite rate that dialysis providers receive for dialysis treatment. Pursuant to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Rule for 2006, effective January 1, 2006, the payment mechanism for separately reimbursed dialysis drugs in both free-standing and hospital-based dialysis centers, including EPOGEN® and Aranesp®, is reimbursed by Medicare at ASP+6% using the same payment amounts used in the physician clinic setting and calculated quarterly in the same manner as described above for our products under the Medicare Part B payment methodology. CMS publishes the ASPs for products in advance of the quarter in which they go into effect. Based upon the 2006 final rule, the reimbursement rate for EPOGEN® for 2006 decreased from the reimbursement rate in 2005. In the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Rule for 2007, CMS continued the 2006 payment mechanism of ASP+6% for EPOGEN® and other separately reimbursed dialysis drugs in both free-standing and hospital-based dialysis centers. Because we cannot accurately predict the extent to which this reimbursement will impact how, or under what circumstances, healthcare     34    Table of Contents       providers will prescribe or administer EPOGEN®, we cannot estimate the full impact of the ASP+6% reimbursement rate on our EPOGEN® product sales. However, we believe that it was not significant in 2006 and is unlikely to be significant in 2007. In addition, the MMA required a demonstration project of a bundled payment system for dialysis, including separately billable drugs and EPOGEN®. The demonstration project was scheduled to start in January 2006, but has been delayed with no announced start date. Bundling initiatives that have been implemented in other healthcare settings have resulted in lower utilization of services that had not previously been a part of the bundled payment. Because CMS is continuing to study bundled payments in the ESRD setting, we cannot predict what impact a bundled payments system would have on sales of EPOGEN® or Aranesp® used in the treatment of persons receiving outpatient dialysis services.  The Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Proposed Rule for 2007 addressed several new topics regarding the ASP payment methodology. In the proposed rule, CMS invited comment on the need for future guidance concerning the methodology for calculating the ASP of drugs sold under market-based pricing arrangements, including “bundled arrangements,” described by CMS as, for example, when a purchaser’s price for one or more drugs is contingent upon the purchase of other drugs or items. In the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule for 2007, CMS chose not to establish a specific methodology that manufacturers must use for the treatment of bundled price concessions for the purposes of the ASP calculation at this time. However, CMS stated that it may provide more specific guidance in the future through rulemaking, program instruction or other guidance. On December 29, 2006, the MedPAC released its second Congressionally-mandated report on the impact of changes in Medicare payments for Part B Drugs specifically recommending that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services clarify ASP reporting requirements “to ensure that ASP calculations allocate discounts to reflect the transaction price for each drug.” Under the ASP system, the Company allocates its discounts based on the prices paid for individual drugs, according to the terms of its contracts with physicians and other purchasers, and we believe that the resulting ASPs reflect the transaction prices for individual drugs. As it is premature to speculate on how CMS and other government organizations may react to the MedPAC’s recommendations, we cannot predict the potential impact the report may have on our business.  Any changes to the ASP calculation could adversely affect the Medicare reimbursement for our products administered in the physician office and the hospital outpatient setting.  In addition, on November 9, 2005, CMS released a revision to the HMA-PM, a Medicare payment review mechanism used by CMS to audit EPOGEN® and Aranesp® (when used in dialysis) utilization and appropriate hematocrit outcomes of dialysis patients. The new policy, Claims Monitoring Policy: Erythropoietin/darbepoetin alfa usage for beneficiaries with end stage renal disease (“Claims Monitoring Policy”), became effective April 1, 2006 and was further revised effective October 1, 2006. The revised Claims Monitoring Policy provides that if a patient’s hemoglobin is greater than 13 grams per deciliter, providers are instructed to reduce the patient’s EPOGEN® and Aranesp® dose and report this reduction on claims using a coding modifier. If the provider does not reduce the patient’s EPOGEN® and Aranesp® dose and there is no medical documentation to support the higher dosage, reimbursement will be reduced to the level it would have been had the provider reduced dosage by twenty-five percent. Based on our preliminary evaluation, we do not expect the Claims Monitoring Policy to have a negative impact on EPOGEN® and Aranesp® sales and given the importance of EPOGEN® and Aranesp® for maintaining the quality of care for dialysis patients, we do not expect that the policy will substantially impact the utilization of EPOGEN® and Aranesp®. However, given the recent revisions, we are currently in the process of further evaluating the Claims Monitoring Policy. As a result, we cannot predict the potential full impact of this final guidance on our business.  Further, the DRA included provisions, which are phased in over time, regarding state collection and submission of data for the purpose of collecting Medicaid drug rebates from manufacturers for physician-administered drugs. We expect that state compliance with elements of these provisions that become effective in 2007 will increase the level of Medicaid rebates paid by us. We are currently in the process of further evaluating the impact of the DRA, and as a result we cannot predict the potential full impact on our business. Related to this issue, CMS issued a proposed Medicaid rule on December 18, 2006 that covered a broad range of topics concerning the calculation and use of AMP and best price as well as a proposed definition for bundled sales under the     35    Table of Contents  Medicaid program. We are undergoing a review of the proposed rule and cannot speculate on the specific contents of the final rule prior to its issuance.  If, and when, reimbursement rates or availability for our marketed products changes adversely or if we fail to obtain adequate reimbursement for our current or future products, healthcare providers may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them, which could reduce the use of our products or cause us to reduce the price of our products. This could result in lower product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations. For example, the use of EPOGEN® in the United States in connection with treatment for end stage renal disease is funded primarily by the U.S. federal government. In early 1997, CMS, formerly known as Healthcare Financing Administration (“HCFA”), instituted a reimbursement change for EPOGEN®, which materially and adversely affected our EPOGEN® sales until the policies were revised. Also, we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in the United States, Europe and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products, which may adversely impact product sales. Further, when a new therapeutic product is approved, the governmental and/or private coverage and reimbursement for that product is uncertain and a failure to demonstrate clear economic value associated with the use of a new therapeutic product as compared to existing therapeutic products or practices may result in inadequate or no reimbursement. We cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for our approved products or product candidates, including those at a late stage of development, and current reimbursement policies for marketed products may change at any time. Sales of all our products are and will be affected by government and private payer reimbursement policies. Reduction in reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and results of operations.  Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.  Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies and reimbursement of our products by government and private payers. (See “— Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”) Organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products. Recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased use and/or dosage of our products. Some examples of agency guidelines include:        •    The GAO issued a report on December 5, 2006 recommending that ESRD drugs and biologics, including EPOGEN®, be bundled into the Medicare dialysis composite payment rate. A day after the GAO report was released, the House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing that focused on EPOGEN®, including discussion of the delay in the MMA mandated bundled payment demonstration, and the GAO report and recommendation. However, Congress did not take legislative action in 2006 to require bundling. Nevertheless, we expect the policy debate around a bundled payment system in ESRD to continue in 2007.        •    The National Kidney Foundation (“NKF”) announced it will formally review recent information that may have an impact on its Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (“KDOQI”) Clinical Practice Guidelines and Clinical Practice Recommendations for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease, which was published in May 2006. The 2006 guidelines recommended that hemoglobin levels for ESA treated patients should be at 11 g/dL or greater and that there was insufficient evidence to recommend routinely maintaining hemoglobin levels at 13.0 g/dL or greater. While we cannot predict whether any amendments to the KDOQI guidelines that reduce the target level will be made, amendments to the guidelines may have a negative impact on the use of our erythropoietin products.    36    Table of Contents     •    The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (“AHRQ”) is currently drafting a comparative effectiveness review (“CER”) of drug therapies for rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis the purpose of which is to compare the benefits and safety of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis disease modifying antirheumatic drug (“DMARD”) therapies to inform clinical decision making. A draft report that will be subject to public comment is expected to be released the first quarter of 2007. We cannot predict what effect, if any, the draft CER will have on DMARD utilization.       •    On February 2, 2007, the USP DI Drug Reference Guides removed Aranesp® for treatment of anemia of cancer. This may cause Medicare contractors or private payers to reconsider whether they will pay for some or all anemia of cancer treatment claims.  Any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price for our common stock.  We may not be able to develop commercial products.  We intend to continue an aggressive research and development program. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&D projects produce a commercial product. Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development, such as in early human clinical trials, may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:        •    the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results        •    the product candidate was not effective or more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness        •    the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals        •    the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use        •    the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize        •    other parties have or may have proprietary rights to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all        •    the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics        •    we and certain of our licensors or partners may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities  Several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process, including, but not limited to, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“BDNF”), Megakaryocyte Growth and Development Factor (“MGDF”) and Glial Cell Lined-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“GDNF”). For example, in 1997, we announced the failure of BDNF for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s Disease, because the product candidate, when administered by injection, did not produce acceptable clinical results for a specific use after a phase 3 trial, even though BDNF had progressed successfully through preclinical and earlier clinical trials. In addition, in 1998, we discontinued development of MGDF, a novel platelet growth factor, at the phase 3 trial stage after several people in platelet donation trials developed low platelet counts and neutralizing antibodies. Also, in June 2004, we announced that the phase 2 study of GDNF for the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease did not meet the primary study endpoint upon completion of nine months of the double-blind treatment phase of the study even though a small phase 1 pilot investigator-initiated open-label study over a three year period appeared to result in improvements for advanced Parkinson’s disease patients. Subsequently, in the fall of 2004 we discontinued clinical development of GDNF in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease after several patients in the phase 2 study developed neutralizing antibodies and new     37    Table of Contents  preclinical data showed that GDNF caused irreversible damage to the area of the brain critical to movement control and coordination. On February 11, 2005, we confirmed our previous decision to halt clinical trials and, as a part of that decision and based on thorough scientific review, we also concluded that we will not provide GDNF to the 48 patients who participated in clinical trials that were terminated in the fall of 2004. Of course, there may be other factors that prevent us from marketing a product. We cannot guarantee we will be able to produce or manufacture commercially successful products. (See “— Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.”; “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.”; and “— Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.”)  We rely on single third-party suppliers for some of our raw materials, medical devices and components; if these third-parties fail to supply these items, we may be unable to supply our products.  Certain raw materials necessary for commercial manufacturing and formulation of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Also, certain medical devices and components necessary for formulation, fill and finish of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Certain of these raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of these unaffiliated third-party suppliers and, in some cases, such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with the FDA so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the FDA approved that other supplier. We would be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices or components for an indeterminate period of time if these third-party single-source suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials or products to us for any reason, including:        •    regulatory requirements or action by the FDA or others        •    adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier        •    unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components        •    labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, or otherwise        •    failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality failures, product contamination and/or recall  These events could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. For example, we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility without impact on our ability to supply these products. However, we may experience these shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints and/or stock-outs of our products.  Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial manufacturing and the formulation of our products are derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and HSA. We are investigating alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of certain biologically-sourced raw materials as such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. Also, some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction of the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt our commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. This could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially.    38    Table of Contents Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.  We currently manufacture and market all our principal products, and we plan to manufacture and market many of our potential products. Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. (See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.”) We currently manufacture our products and product candidates at our manufacturing facilities located in Thousand Oaks and Fremont, California, Boulder and Longmont, Colorado, West Greenwich, Rhode Island and Juncos, Puerto Rico (See “— We formulate, fill and finish substantially all our products at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at this facility, we may not be able to supply these products.”) Additionally, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of ENBREL and Sensipar®/Mimpara® and in the formulation, fill and finish of VectibixTM and plan to use contract manufacturers to produce a number of our late stage product candidates. (See “— We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our bulk supply and the formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL.”) Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities which is impacted by many manufacturing variables including:        •    availability or contamination of raw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier        •    facility capacity of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturers        •    facility contamination by microorganisms or viruses        •    compliance with regulatory requirements        •    changes in forecasts of future demand        •    timing and actual number of production runs        •    production success rates and bulk drug yields        •    timing and outcome of product quality testing  If we have problems in one or more of these or other manufacturing variables, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. For example, in the second quarter of 2002, the prior co-marketers with respect to ENBREL experienced a brief period where no ENBREL was available to fill patient prescriptions, primarily due to variation in the expected production yield from BI Pharma. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients, physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, and sales of our products will be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales and results of operations.  We manufacture and contract manufacture, price, sell, distribute and market or co-market our products for their approved indications. These activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, such as the FDA and CMS, as well as in foreign countries, including European countries, Canada, Australia and Japan. Although we have obtained regulatory approval for our marketed products, these products and our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo a potentially lengthy FDA or other regulatory approval process are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build and license a new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify a new contract manufacturer. In order to maintain adequate supply to keep up with growing demand for our products, mitigate risks associated with the vast majority of our formulation, fill and finish operations located in Puerto Rico, and to adequately prepare to launch a number of our late-stage product candidates, we must successfully implement a number of manufacturing projects on schedule, operate our facilities at nearly full production capacity over the next few years, expand our use of third-party contract manufacturers, build inventory of our bulk and finished products and maintain a     39    Table of Contents  state of regulatory compliance. Key manufacturing projects include: 1) construction, qualification and licensure of our new process bulk and formulation, fill and finish plant in Ireland; 2) construction, qualification and licensure of new formulation, fill and finish facilities at our Puerto Rico site; and 3) expansion of existing bulk protein facilities at our Puerto Rico site including the licensure of our Puerto Rico plant for production of Epoetin and darbepoetin bulk drug substance and increased production of pegfilgrastim and Filgrastim bulk drug substance.  If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing or selling our marketed products until we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers are subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. For example, we are dependent upon a single FDA approved third-party contract manufacturer for the formulation, fill and finish of VectibixTM. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us for any reason, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. If we are unable to manufacture, market and sell our products, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.  We formulate, fill and finish substantially all our products at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at this facility, we may not be able to supply these products.  We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for EPOGEN®, Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® and some formulation, fill and finish operations for ENBREL at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. Our global supply of these products is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of this facility. Additionally, to keep up with the growing demand for our products, we are operating this facility at nearly full production capacity. A number of factors could adversely affect our formulation, fill and finish operations, including:        •    power failures        •    breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment        •    improper installation or operation of equipment        •    labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, or otherwise        •    inability of third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and components        •    natural or other disasters, including hurricanes        •    failures to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of the FDA  For example, this facility in Puerto Rico has experienced manufacturing component shortages and has had evidence of adverse trends in the microbial bioburden of the production environment that reduced the production output. Although these experiences in Puerto Rico have not impacted our ability to supply product in the past, the same or other problems may result in our being unable to supply these products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. Although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against certain business interruption losses, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. The extent of the coverage of our insurance could limit our ability to mitigate for lost sales and could result in such losses adversely affecting our product sales and operating results materially. (See “— Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.”)    40    Table of Contents We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our bulk supply and the formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL.  We currently produce a substantial portion of annual ENBREL supply at our Rhode Island manufacturing facilities. However, we also depend on third parties for a significant portion of our ENBREL bulk supply as well as for some of the formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL that we manufacture. BI Pharma is our third-party contract manufacturer of ENBREL bulk drug; accordingly, our U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL is currently significantly dependent on BI Pharma’s production schedule for ENBREL. We would be unable to produce ENBREL in sufficient quantities to substantially offset shortages in BI Pharma’s scheduled production if BI Pharma or other third-party contract manufacturers used for the formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL bulk drug were to cease or interrupt production or services or otherwise fail to supply materials, products or services to us for any reason, including due to labor shortages or disputes, regulatory requirements or action or contamination of product lots or product recalls. For example, in the second quarter of 2002, the prior co-marketers with respect to ENBREL experienced a brief period where no ENBREL was available to fill patient prescriptions, primarily due to variation in the expected production yield from BI Pharma. We cannot guarantee that an alternative third-party contract manufacturer would be available on a timely basis or at all. This in turn could materially reduce our ability to satisfy demand for ENBREL, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.  Among the factors that could affect our actual supply of ENBREL at any time include, without limitation, BI Pharma’s and the Rhode Island facilities’ bulk drug production scheduling. For example, BI Pharma does not produce ENBREL continuously; rather, it produces the bulk drug substance through a series of periodic campaigns throughout the year. Our Rhode Island manufacturing facilities are currently dedicated to ENBREL production. The amount of commercial inventory available to us at any time depends on a variety of factors, including the timing and actual number of BI Pharma’s production runs, the actual number of runs at our Rhode Island manufacturing facilities, and, for either the Rhode Island or BI Pharma facilities, the level of production yields and success rates, the timing and outcome of product quality testing and the amount of formulation, fill and finish capacity. We are also dependent on third-parties for some formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL bulk drug substance manufactured at our Rhode Island facilities. If third-party formulation, fill and finish manufacturers are unable to provide sufficient capacity or are otherwise unable to provide services to us, the supply of ENBREL could be adversely affected materially.  Under a collaboration and global supply agreement, the Company and Wyeth share the total worldwide bulk supply of ENBREL produced by Amgen’s Rhode Island manufacturing facilities, BI Pharma’s manufacturing facility in Germany and Wyeth’s manufacturing facility in Ireland. Our ENBREL supply forecasts rely on certain assumptions of how much ENBREL each of these manufacturing facilities is expected to produce. If any of these manufacturing facilities are unable to produce in accordance with our or Wyeth’s expectations, the worldwide supply of ENBREL could be adversely affected materially. In such cases, we may be required to allocate supply for Wyeth’s benefit. To the extent that there is a shortfall in worldwide production expectations, our supply of ENBREL could be adversely affected. Additionally, the costs associated with a shortfall or failure in production of ENBREL would be borne by both parties.  Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.  We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. For example, ENBREL competes in certain circumstances with products marketed by Johnson & Johnson, Abbott, Biogen, Genentech, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Novartis and Sanofi-Aventis, as well as the generic drug methotrexate, and may face competition from other potential therapies being developed. While ENBREL continues to maintain a leading position in both rheumatology and dermatology, it has experienced share loss to competitors. Additionally, Aranesp® competes with products marketed by Johnson & Johnson in the United States and the EU and with products marketed by Roche in the EU. Also, Aranesp® may face competition in the EU in 2007 from another erythropoietin product produced by Shire. Aranesp® and EPOGEN® may also face competition in the U.S. from Roche’s peg-EPO for which they have     41    Table of Contents  filed a BLA with the FDA. According to Roche’s public statements, they expect to launch the molecule in the U.S. nephrology segment in 2007, despite our ongoing lawsuit and their acknowledgement of our U.S. erythropoietin patents. (See “— If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.”) In addition, Astellas/FibroGen are co-developing an erythropoietic small molecule and Affymax is developing an erythropoietin mimetic for the treatment of anemia. VectibixTM, our recently launched oncology therapeutic to treat patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, competes with Imclone’s Erbitux®. Further, if our currently marketed products are approved for new uses, or if we sell new products, we may face new, additional competition that we do not face today. Our products may compete against products that have lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, are easier to administer or that are otherwise competitive with our products.  Our principal European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December 12, 2004 and our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expired on August 22, 2006. We believe that as these patents have expired, other companies could receive approval for and market biosimilar products to compete with our products in the EU, presenting additional competition to our products. Although we cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU, we expect that the first biosimilar G-CSF product may be approved some time in 2007 and could be available shortly thereafter, and that it would compete with Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. While we do not market EPOGEN® in Europe as this right belongs to Johnson & Johnson (through KA), we do market Aranesp® in the EU, which competes with Johnson & Johnson’s EPREX® product, Roche’s NeoRecormon® product and others’ erythropoietin products. In addition, Roche is developing its peg-EPO product which, upon regulatory approval, we expect they will launch in the EU nephrology segment in 2007. We believe that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the EU in 2007 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval. We cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar products or other competing products would impact future Aranesp®, Neulasta® or NEUPOGEN® sales in the EU. Our inability to compete effectively could reduce sales which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations.  In 2006, the EMEA developed and issued final regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. The final guidelines included clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products including erythropoietins and G-CSFs, which guidance recommends that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct fairly extensive pharmacodynamic, toxicological, clinical safety studies and a pharmacovigilance program. In the United States, there currently is no legal approval pathway for follow-on biologics. A number of events would need to occur before these products could enter the market, including passage of legislation by Congress to create a new approval pathway and promulgation of associated regulations and guidance by the FDA. Until such legislation is created, we cannot predict when follow-on biologics could appear in the United States. Certain of our competitors, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, market products or are actively engaged in R&D in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. In the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs approved for other indications that may be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical corporations may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and human resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. These resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. Business combinations among our competitors may also increase competition and the resources available to our competitors.    42    Table of Contents We have grown rapidly, and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted.  We have had an aggressive growth plan that has included substantial and increasing investments in research and development, sales and marketing and facilities. We plan to continue to grow and our plan has a number of risks, some of which we cannot completely control. For example:        •    we need to generate higher revenues to cover a higher level of operating expenses, and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control        •    we need to attract and retain highly qualified management, scientific, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel, including a significant number of new personnel to support our R&D organization and manufacturing operations in 2007        •    we will need to assimilate new staff members and we will need to manage complexities associated with a larger, faster growing and more geographically diverse organization        •    we will need to expand our clinical development resources to manage and execute increasingly global, larger and more complex clinical trials        •    we will need to significantly expand our sales and marketing resources to launch a number of late-stage product candidates close in time        •    we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing capacity for both commercial and clinical supply        •    we will need to start up our new manufacturing facilities and enter into and manage new third-party contract manufacturing arrangements, while operating our existing manufacturing facilities at near or full capacity        •    we are implementing an enterprise resource planning system to support our increasingly complex business and business processes and such implementation is costly and carries substantial operations risk, including loss of data or information, unanticipated increases in costs, disruption of operations or business interruption  Of course, there may be other risks and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully manage these or other risks. If we fail to manage our growth in these ways or others, such failure could result in a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.  Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of free-standing dialysis clinic businesses may negatively impact our bargaining power and profit margins.  The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales are made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of these products, EPOGEN®, is primarily sold to free-standing dialysis clinics, which have recently experienced significant consolidation. Two organizations, DaVita Inc. and Fresenius own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and account for a significant majority of all EPOGEN® sales in the free-standing dialysis clinic setting. In October 2006, we entered into a five-year sole sourcing and supply agreement with an affiliate of Fresenius, on its behalf and on behalf of certain of its affiliates, to purchase, and we have agreed to supply, all of Fresenius’ commercial requirements for erythropoietic stimulating proteins for use in managing the anemia of its hemodialysis patients in the United States and Puerto Rico, based on forecasts provided by Fresenius and subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement.  This concentration and consolidation has increased these entities’ purchasing leverage and may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products or fees for other services, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margins. The results of these developments may have a material adverse effect on our product sales and results of operations.    43    Table of Contents Our marketing of ENBREL will be dependent in part upon Wyeth.  Under a co-promotion agreement, the Company and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL in the United States and Canada. A management committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from us and Wyeth is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL including strategic planning, the approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing and the establishment of a brand team. The brand team, with equal representation from us and Wyeth, prepares and implements the annual marketing plan, which includes a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party, and is responsible for all sales activities. If Wyeth fails to market ENBREL effectively or if the Company and Wyeth fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, our sales of ENBREL may be adversely affected materially.  Our business may be impacted by government investigations or litigation.  We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to various patent matters, government investigations, our business operations, government requests for information and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Matters required to be disclosed by us are set forth in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and are updated as required in subsequently filed Form 10-Qs. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that affects how we operate our business. Consequently, it is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (in the case of monetary damages, in the period in which such damages are incurred).  The federal government, state governments and private payers are investigating, and many have filed actions against numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Amgen and Immunex, now a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, alleging that the reporting of prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted in false and overstated AWP, which in turn is alleged to have improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by Medicare beneficiaries, insurers, state Medicaid programs, medical plans and other payers to healthcare providers who prescribed and administered those products. A number of these actions have been brought against us and/or Immunex. Additionally, a number of states have pending investigations regarding our Medicaid drug pricing practices and the U.S. Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services have requested that Immunex produce documents relating to pricing issues. Further, certain state government entity plaintiffs in some of these AWP cases are also alleging that companies, including ours, were not reporting their “best price” to the states under the Medicaid program. These cases and investigations are described in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Average Wholesale Price Litigation” and are updated as required in subsequent Form 10-Qs. Other states and agencies could initiate investigations of our pricing practices. A decision adverse to our interests on these actions and/or investigations could result in substantial economic damages and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such liabilities are incurred.  We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims.  Product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management’s attention, and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Amgen and Immunex have been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products.  Our stock price is volatile, which could adversely affect your investment.  Our stock price, like that of other biotechnology companies, is volatile. For example, in the fifty-two weeks prior to December 31, 2006, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a high of $80.36 per share to a low of $63.92 per share. Our stock price may be affected by a number of factors, such as:        •    changes in the government’s or private payers’ reimbursement policies or prescribing guidelines for our products    44    Table of Contents     •    adverse developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products        •    actual or anticipated clinical trial results of ours or other companies and organizations        •    actual or anticipated product supply constraints        •    product development or other business announcements by us or our competitors        •    regulatory matters or actions        •    announcements in the scientific and research community        •    intellectual property and legal matters        •    broader economic, industry and market trends unrelated to our performance        •    pronouncements and rule changes by applicable standards authorities that change the manner in which we account for certain transactions  In addition, if our revenues, earnings or other financial results in any period fail to meet the investment community’s expectations, there could be an immediate adverse impact on our stock price.  Our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations.  The development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the United States and to extensive regulation in foreign countries. (See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.” and “— Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.”) While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe to be current best practices, we cannot assure you that we or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws or all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations and/or laws a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, including withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation.  Our revenues may fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause financial results to be below expectations.  Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. In budgeting our operating expenses for the foreseeable future, we assume that revenues will continue to grow; however, some of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term. Because of this, even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period’s results to be below our expectations or projections. A revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors, some of which we cannot control. For example, we may face:        •    changes in the government’s or private payers’ reimbursement policies or prescribing guidelines for our products        •    adverse developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products        •    inability to maintain regulatory approval of marketed products or manufacturing facilities        •    changes in our product pricing strategies        •    lower than expected demand for our products    45    Table of Contents     •    inability to provide adequate supply of our products        •    changes in wholesaler buying patterns        •    increased competition from new or existing products        •    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  Of course, there may be other factors that affect our revenues in any given period. Similarly if investors or the investment community are uncertain about our financial performance for a given period, our stock price could also be adversely impacted.  Continual manufacturing process improvement efforts may result in the carrying value of certain existing manufacturing facilities or other assets becoming impaired.  In connection with our ongoing process improvement activities associated with products we manufacture, we continually invest in our various manufacturing practices and related processes with the objective of increasing production yields and success rates to gain increased cost efficiencies and capacity utilization. We are investigating alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of certain biologically-sourced raw materials. The development or implementation of such processes could result in changes to or redundancies with our existing manufacturing operations. Depending on the timing and outcomes of these efforts and our other estimates and assumptions regarding future product sales, the carrying value of certain manufacturing facilities or other assets may not be fully recoverable and could result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value at the time that such effects are identified. The potential recognition of impairment in the carrying value, if any, could have a material and adverse affect on our results of operations.       Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
