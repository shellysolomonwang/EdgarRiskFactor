Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.”)  Key Developments  The following is a summary of selected key developments affecting our business that occurred during 2008 and early 2009, including regulatory and reimbursement developments associated with our ESA products and other developments regarding certain of our other marketed products and product candidates.  ESA Regulatory and Reimbursement Developments  The ESA regulatory and reimbursement developments in 2008 reflect a continuation of events that began in late 2006 that affected the class of ESA products, including Aranesp® and EPOGEN®. Certain of the developments discussed below have had a material adverse impact on sales of our ESA products, in particular Aranesp® sales in the U.S. supportive cancer care setting.  Beginning in late 2006, adverse safety results involving ESA products were observed in various studies that were performed by us and by others (including our licensees or independent investigators) that explored the use of ESAs in settings different from those outlined in the FDA approved label, including targeting higher hemoglobin (“Hb”) levels and/or use in non-approved patient populations. The results of these studies culminated in significant regulatory and reimbursement developments affecting the class of ESA products, including     2    Table of Contents  Aranesp® and EPOGEN®. For example, in February 2007, following the reported results from our Anemia of Cancer phase 3 study (the “AoC 103 study”), the United States Pharmacopoeia Dispensing Information (“USP DI”) Drug Reference Guides removed Aranesp® in the treatment of anemia of cancer (“AoC”). Thereafter, Aranesp® use in AoC essentially ceased. In addition, during 2007, we had discussions with the FDA and other regulatory authorities and meetings with certain of the FDA’s advisory panels, which led to further developments. For example, in March 2007, the product labeling information for the class of ESAs was updated, including a boxed warning in the prescribing information (“PI”). In addition, in November 2007, following our meeting with the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) in May 2007, various additional safety-related revisions were again made to the ESA label. Further, in July 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued its National Coverage Decision Memorandum for Use of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents in Cancer and Related Neoplastic Conditions (the “Decision Memorandum”). The Decision Memorandum established the ESA reimbursement policy for Medicare and other government beneficiaries who are treated for chemotherapy-induced anemia (“CIA”) with ESAs. We believe that the restrictions in the Decision Memorandum changed the way ESAs are used in clinical practice by decreasing the number of treated patients, the average dose and duration of ESA therapy.  Discussions with regulatory authorities, including the FDA, regarding safety concerns with respect to the administration of ESA products in various settings continued throughout 2008, resulting in further regulatory developments. The following is a summary of selected key regulatory and related developments that occurred in 2008.  During 2008, the ESA labeling information was further revised to reflect various safety concerns, beginning in March 2008, with an updated boxed warning in the labeling information in the United States. This updated box warning states that ESAs shorten overall survival and/or time-to-tumor progression in clinical studies in patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid and cervical cancers when dosed to a target Hb level of greater than or equal to 12 grams per deciliter (“g/dL”). Additionally, on August 6, 2008, we revised the ESA product labeling, as the FDA directed, based on a complete response letter, received on July 30, 2008, from the FDA to the revisions to the ESA labeling we proposed following the March 13, 2008 ODAC meeting. The revised labeling included, among other things, (i) the addition to the boxed warning of a statement that ESAs are not indicated for patients receiving myelosuppressive therapy when the anticipated outcome of such therapy is cure, (ii) the addition of a statement in the DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION section of the label that ESA therapy should not be initiated at Hb levels ³ 10 g/dL and that dose should be adjusted to maintain the lowest Hb level sufficient to avoid red blood cell transfusions and (iii) the removal of reference to the upper safety limit of 12 g/dL. Further, following the closed meeting by the Scientific Advisory Group on Oncology (“SAG-O”) in May 2008, we received notification in October 2008 that the European Commission had approved updates to the Aranesp® product information. The product information for all ESAs was updated to advise that in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anemia in patients with cancer and that the decision to administer ESAs should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient. This assessment should take into account the specific clinical context, including the type of tumor and its stage, the degree of anemia, life-expectancy, the environment in which the patient is being treated and patient preference.  In addition, on January 1, 2008, the CMS’ revisions to its Erythropoietin Monitoring Policy (“EMP”) became effective, which require a 50% reduction in Medicare reimbursement if a patient’s Hb level is above 13 g/dL for three or more consecutive months. In addition, the EMP reduces the monthly dosing limits to 400,000 international units (“IUs”) of EPOGEN®, from 500,000 IUs, and to 1,200 micrograms (“mcgs”) of Aranesp®, from 1,500 mcgs. We believe that the EMP implementation in January 2008 has significantly affected physician behavior resulting in declines in dosing trends as particularly noted in the quarter of implementation. However, this dose decline subsequently stabilized in 2008 but may further fluctuate in the future.  Further, on September 30, 2008, we announced that we had received a summary of preliminary results from the Cochrane Collaboration’s independent meta-analysis of patient-level data from previously conducted, randomized, controlled, clinical studies evaluating ESAs in cancer patients which we submitted to the FDA and     3    Table of Contents  the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products (“EMEA”). These results were also presented by the Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group in December at the 2008 American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) Congress.  This Cochrane meta-analysis of patient level data from previous studies corroborates prior analyses indicating that the use of ESAs may increase the risk of death in cancer patients. The studies in the analysis all predate the current label, which advises using the least amount of ESA necessary to avoid transfusion.  The analyses on all cancer patients were based on 53 previously conducted studies involving 13,933 patients. None of these studies utilized ESAs according to current label guidance. The overall survival results corroborate an earlier review by the Cochrane Collaboration, published in 2006, which is included in the WARNINGS section of the current U.S. PI (Hazard Ratio (“HR”): 1.08 [95% Confidence Interval (“CI”) 0.99 - 1.18]). The ESA treatment arm had increased on-study deaths (HR: 1.17 [95% CI 1.06 - 1.30]) and decreased overall survival (HR: 1.06 [95% CI 1.00 - 1.12]) compared to controls. The analyses on patients undergoing chemotherapy, the cancer indication for which ESAs are approved, were based on 38 studies with 10,441 patients. None of these studies utilized ESAs according to current label guidance. The ESA treatment arm had increased on-study deaths (HR: 1.10 [95% CI 0.98 - 1.24]) and decreased overall survival (HR: 1.04 [95% CI 0.97 - 1.11]) compared to controls. While neither of these results is statistically significant, they do not exclude the potential for adverse outcomes when ESAs are prescribed according to the current label. The final report on these endpoints is expected in 2009.  Our ESA products will continue to face future challenges. For example, we continue to work with the FDA to finalize a new protocol for a clinical trial to determine the effects of ESAs on survival and tumor outcomes in anemic patients with metastatic cancer receiving concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy. We have submitted an Aranesp® study protocol to the FDA and plan to initiate the study in 2009. In addition, in response to the FDA’s request under authority prescribed by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (the “FDAAA”), we continue to work closely with the FDA to develop a REMS program for the class of ESA products. We have submitted a proposed REMS in response to the FDA’s requests. The components of the REMS approved by the FDA could be different for the use of ESAs in the oncology and nephrology indications. We believe that a REMS program for our ESA products could have a material adverse impact on the future sales of Aranesp®, especially in the U.S. supportive cancer care setting. Additionally, future Aranesp® sales could also be materially adversely impacted by further changes in reimbursement, including as a result of future regulatory developments.  Other Regulatory Developments  ENBREL  On March 17, 2008, we and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, a division of Wyeth, announced updates to the FDA approved labeling for ENBREL, in which the U.S. PI now contains a boxed warning relating to the risk of infections, including tuberculosis. This information in the boxed warning includes additional language regarding screening and monitoring patients for tuberculosis, including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection. As part of this labeling update, the FDA also required the implementation of a REMS for ENBREL in the form of a medication guide. Additionally, following the FDA web-alert on September 4, 2008 regarding their review of histoplasmosis and other opportunistic fungal infections in patients treated with TNF-blockers, the FDA requested that the boxed warning and WARNINGS sections of the U.S. PI and the medication guide for ENBREL (and other TNF-blockers) be strengthened to include the risk of unrecognized histoplasmosis and other invasive fungal infections with the goal of increasing timely diagnosis and treatment. The FDA also requested that the approved REMS for ENBREL be modified with a communication plan to healthcare providers regarding the risk of unrecognized fungal infections. In December 2008, we agreed with the FDA on the required revisions to the U.S. PI, and we continue to work with the FDA to finalize the requested updates to the ENBREL REMS.  In addition, there are several other outstanding regulatory matters that may also negatively impact future ENBREL product sales. For example, on June 4, 2008, the FDA issued an Early Communication regarding an ongoing safety review of TNF-blockers and the possible association between the use of these medicines and the     4    Table of Contents  development of lymphoma and other cancers in children and young adults and stated that it had decided to conduct further analyses to evaluate the risk and benefits of TNF-blockers in pediatric patients. Furthermore, following the June 18, 2008 Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee (“DODAC”) meeting, on July 24, 2008, we received notification from the FDA through a complete response letter that they would like additional information from us regarding the use of ENBREL in pediatric patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. We continue to work with the FDA to provide it with the above-noted requested information.  Nplate® (romiplostim)  On August 22, 2008, the FDA approved Nplate®, the first platelet producer for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in splenectomized (spleen removed) and non-splenectomized adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (“ITP”). Nplate®, the first FDA approved peptibody protein, works by raising and sustaining platelet counts. As part of the approval for Nplate®, a REMS was developed with the FDA to assure the safe use of Nplate® while minimizing risk. The Nplate®  REMS involves, among other things, healthcare provider and patient enrollment registries, tracking of patient medical history and data and follow-up safety questionnaires to healthcare providers, all of which require extensive discussion with and education of healthcare providers. In addition, on February 6, 2009, we announced that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Nplate® for the treatment of splenectomized adult chronic ITP patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). In the European Union (“EU”), Nplate® may also be considered as second line treatment for adult non-splenectomized ITP patients where surgery is contra-indicated.  Vectibix® (panitumumab)  At the ODAC meeting on December 16, 2008, we discussed the clinical utility of the KRAS gene as a predictive biomarker in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (“mCRC”) treated with anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors (“EGFr”) antibody, Vectibix®. We believe that data shared with the ODAC supports the suggestion that KRAS is a predictive biomarker for the anti-EGFr class of drugs in the monotherapy setting. In March 2008, the Journal of Clinical Oncology published results from an analysis of the first randomized, controlled clinical trial (“Study 408”), which showed that mCRC patients with mutated KRAS tumors do not respond to Vectibix® monotherapy. Conversely, patients with wild-type KRAS tumors treated with Vectibix® have a better response rate and prolonged progression-free survival (“PFS”).  Clinical Developments  Denosumab  Denosumab is the first fully human monoclonal antibody in late stage clinical development that specifically targets a ligand known as RANKL (that binds to a receptor known as RANK), an essential regulator of osteoclasts (the cells that break down bone). Denosumab is being investigated for its potential to inhibit all stages of osteoclast activity through a targeted mechanism. In December 2008, we submitted a biologics license application (“BLA”) to the FDA for denosumab for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis (“PMO”) in women and bone loss in patients undergoing hormone ablation for either prostate or breast cancer. On February 18, 2009, the FDA accepted our BLA and informed us that it will target an FDA action within ten months of the BLA’s submission date, resulting in a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) action date of October 19, 2009. The FDA indicated that it intends to simultaneously review the data we submitted for both the PMO and bone loss in patients undergoing hormone ablation for prostate or breast cancer indications due to the interdependency of the data across the indications from more than 11,000 patients included in support of the BLA. Additionally, in January 2009, we submitted an application to the EMEA for the approval of denosumab for treatment of PMO in women and treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation therapy in patients with breast and prostate cancer. In addition, during 2008, we announced results of the following key trials involving denosumab.  Osteoporosis  On September 16, 2008 at the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (“ASBMR”) annual meeting, we presented detailed results from the pivotal fracture trial (“Study 216”) evaluating denosumab in the     5    Table of Contents  treatment of PMO. In this pivotal, three-year, international, phase 3 study of approximately 7,800 women with osteoporosis, patients were randomized to receive either denosumab, given by subcutaneous injection once every six months, or placebo injections. For the primary endpoint, treatment with denosumab resulted in a statistically significant reduction (68%) in the incidence of new vertebral fractures compared with placebo treatment (2.3% for denosumab versus 7.2% for placebo, p=0.0001). In addition, women receiving denosumab experienced a statistically significant reduction (20%) in the incidence of new non-vertebral fractures compared with placebo treatment (6.5% for denosumab versus 8.0% for placebo, p=0.011) and a statistically significant reduction (40%) in the incidence of hip fractures compared with placebo treatment (0.7% for denosumab versus 1.2% for placebo, p=0.036), each a secondary endpoint. The incidence and types of both adverse and serious adverse events observed in this study, including serious infections and neoplasms, were similar between the denosumab and placebo groups. The most common adverse events across both treatment arms were arthralgia, back pain, hypertension and nasopharyngitis.  In addition to the detailed results of Study 216, we presented the results of two non-pivotal phase 3 studies of denosumab in osteoporosis at the ASBMR meeting. The first was a phase 3 head-to-head, double-blind trial known as the Study of Transitioning from AleNdronate to Denosumab trial (“STAND”) (“Study 234”). The results of this study demonstrated that subcutaneous injections of denosumab every six months achieved significantly greater increases in bone mineral density (“BMD”) versus those achieved with alendronate (“ALN”) at all sites measured. For the primary endpoint, denosumab resulted in significant increases in BMD at the total hip compared with ALN (1.9% for denosumab versus 1.05% for ALN, p<0.0001). Treatment with denosumab also resulted in significant increases in BMD compared with continued ALN treatment at all secondary endpoints, including the lumbar spine, femoral neck, hip trochanter and 1/3 radius. The incidence and types of adverse events observed in the study, including neoplasms and infection, were similar between the denosumab and ALN treatment groups. The most common adverse events across both treatment arms were back pain, arthralgia and nasal pharyngitis. The second non-pivotal study was a head-to-head trial comparing denosumab to weekly oral ALN, also known as the Determining Efficacy: Comparison of Initiating Denosumab versus Alendronate trial (“DECIDE”) (“Study 141”). As a part of this study, patients were given a questionnaire after 12 months of treatment to gauge preference on mode of administration as well as satisfaction with frequency of dosing of twice-yearly subcutaneous injections versus weekly oral tablet. More than three-quarters of patients in both study arms preferred subcutaneous injection over oral pills (77% versus 23%, p <0.0001). In addition, significantly more patients were more satisfied with twice-yearly dosing compared to weekly dosing (80% placebo injection versus 20% weekly oral ALN, and 79% for denosumab versus 21% weekly placebo tablet, p <0.0001 for both study groups).  Oncology  On July 14, 2008, we announced findings from a three-year pivotal phase 3 placebo-controlled trial evaluating denosumab in the treatment of bone loss in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (“ADT”) for non-metastatic prostate cancer (“Study 138”). In this study of more than 1,400 men, denosumab treatment produced statistically significantly greater increases in BMD at the lumbar spine (primary endpoint) and non-vertebral sites compared with placebo at multiple time points. These improvements in BMD were consistent with those seen in other denosumab studies evaluating BMD in women with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitor (“AI”) therapy, and in postmenopausal women with low bone mass. During the 36-month evaluation period, men receiving denosumab experienced less than half the incidence of new vertebral fractures (a secondary endpoint) compared with those receiving placebo, a statistically significant finding. Furthermore, in the denosumab arm there were fewer non-vertebral fractures over the 36-month period. The incidence and types of adverse events observed in this study were generally similar between the denosumab and placebo groups. The most common adverse events across both treatment arms were arthralgia, back pain, constipation and pain in extremity. Serious adverse infectious events occurred in approximately 5% of men receiving placebo treatment as compared with approximately 6% of those receiving denosumab.    6    Table of Contents Competitive Developments  Certain of our marketed products are under increased competitive pressures, including from biosimilar and other products in Europe, which compete or are expected to compete with Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®, as well as our marketed products in the United States, including ENBREL. For example, as a result of final regulatory guidelines issued by the EMEA in 2006 related to the development and approval of biosimilar products, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition throughout Europe, including from a number of biosimilar erythropoietin products, which compete with Aranesp®. In addition, a number of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (“G-CSF”) biosimilar products have received marketing authorization from the European Commission in 2008 and early 2009 and have been or are expected to be launched and compete with Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. Further in the United States, ENBREL will continue to face increased competition primarily due to the expected launch of new products.  Litigation Developments  On October 17, 2008, the Massachusetts District Court entered judgment that the patents in suit are valid and enforceable, and that the patents, identified below as the subject of the permanent injunction, would be infringed by the import, use and sale of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (“Roche”) pegylated erythropoietin product in the United States. The Massachusetts District Court permanently enjoined Roche from infringing the ‘422 Patent, the ‘933 Patent, the ‘868 Patent and the ‘698 Patent for the remaining life of these patents. See Note 10, “Contingencies — Roche Matters — Amgen Inc. v. F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. et al.” for further discussion of this legal proceeding.  On July 11, 2008, we announced that we had reached an agreement to settle our antitrust litigation with Ortho Biotech Products L.P., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (hereafter referred to as “Ortho Biotech” or “J&J”), which had alleged that discounts offered to oncology clinics on our NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta® and Aranesp® products violated antitrust laws. Under terms of the agreement, we paid Ortho Biotech $200 million and the pending litigation in New Jersey District Court was dismissed with prejudice.  Economic and Political Developments  Capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption, particularly during the latter part of 2008 and the beginning of 2009. We are working to manage our business effectively despite the unprecedented conditions in the financial markets both in the United States and around the world. To date, these macro economic challenges have not affected us to a large degree. The extent and/or the duration of any potential adverse economic impact that such financial disruption may have on our third-party payors, including governments and private insurance plans, wholesale distributors, customers, service providers and suppliers is unclear. However, it may result in reduced demand for our products. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — The volatility of the current financial markets and the general economic slowdown may magnify certain risks that affect our business.”)  Further, beginning in late 2008 and continuing into 2009, foreign currency rates have also been experiencing extreme volatility. Changes in foreign currency rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales. However, the benefit or detriment of any resulting increases or decreases that movements in foreign currency exchange rates have on our international product sales are largely offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and as a result of our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to the Euro.  In addition, we believe the new U.S. presidential administration, together with Congress, will shape U.S. healthcare policy in the coming months and years, and we expect that healthcare reform efforts could include long-term changes to coverage and reimbursement that may have a significant impact on our business. Furthermore, due to the increasing expectations and demands of healthcare payors, we believe that we and others in our industry will be under increased pressure to further demonstrate the efficacy and economic value of our products.    7    Table of Contents Other Developments  In February 2008, we entered into a license agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”), which provided them the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize for the Japanese market up to 12 clinical stage molecules from our pipeline across a range of therapeutic areas, including oncology and inflammation. The molecules covered by the license agreement primarily include: AMG 108, AMG 317, AMG 386, AMG 479, AMG 655 and Vectibix®. We have the right to participate in the promotion of these products in Japan. In addition, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda for the worldwide development and commercialization of motesanib (AMG 706). Each party has the right to participate in the commercialization of motesanib in the other party’s territory. In connection with these agreements, Takeda acquired our subsidiary in Japan, Amgen K.K.  As a result of the challenges facing certain of our products and, in particular, the regulatory and reimbursement developments involving our marketed ESA products that began in 2007, as discussed above, and their resulting impact on our operations, on August 15, 2007, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing to make significant R&D investments and build the framework for our future growth. Through December 31, 2008, we have completed substantially all of the actions initially included in our restructuring plan, including the divestiture of certain less significant marketed products discussed below. During 2008, we identified certain additional initiatives designed to further assist in improving our cost structure, including outsourcing certain non-core business functions, most notably certain of our information systems’ infrastructure services, as well as abandoning leases for certain additional facilities that will no longer be used in our operations. The estimated cost of these additional initiatives is $95 million to $135 million. The total charges currently estimated to be incurred in connection with our restructuring plan, including related implementation costs, is $950 million to $985 million. Through December 31, 2008, we have incurred $887 million of these costs and currently estimate that all remaining costs will be substantially incurred in 2009.  In September 2008, we entered into an agreement with Biovitrum AB (“Biovitrum”) whereby they acquired from us the marketed biologic therapeutic products Kepivance® (palifermin) and Stemgen® (ancestim), and also obtained from us a worldwide exclusive license to Kineret® (anakinra) for its current approved indication. In connection with the disposal of these less significant marketed products, we incurred a $10 million loss. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the worldwide product sales for these marketed products were approximately $70 million.  Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates  We market our principal products in the areas of supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products include Aranesp®, EPOGEN®, Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN® and ENBREL. Our products’ competitive position among other biologic and pharmaceutical products may be based on, among other things, patent position, product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, patient convenience/delivery devices, price and reimbursement. Certain of our products face substantial competition from products marketed by large pharmaceutical corporations, which may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and human resources than we do. In addition, the introduction of new products or the development of new processes by competitors or new information about existing products may result in increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents, or reduction in the price we receive from selling our products. Further, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may require less use of our products, particularly in supportive cancer care. For example, the development of new treatments for cancer, such as targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, or chemotherapy regimens that are less myelosuppressive, may require less Aranesp® or Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®. In addition, we expect to continue to face increasingly intense competition, including from new and existing product technologies and competitive pressures associated with biosimilar and other products. In 2006, the EMEA developed and issued final regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products and, as a result, we have begun to experience and expect to continue to experience increased competition from biosimilar products throughout the EU. Further, although there is currently no legal pathway for abbreviated approval of BLA’s for biosimilars in the United States, given the continuing interest by Congress on this issue and on healthcare reform in general, it     8    Table of Contents  is likely that legislation on biosimilars will be introduced in 2009 and possibly passed into law. The new U.S. presidential administration has also expressed an interest in passing legislation regarding biosimilars.  We operate in a highly regulated industry and various U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial authority over how we conduct our business in those countries. The regulatory environment is evolving and there is increased scrutiny on drug safety and increased authority being granted to regulatory bodies to assist in ensuring the safety of therapeutic products. Certain regulatory developments discussed above in the “Key Developments” section, have and will continue to impact future sales of certain of our products.  Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa)   Aranesp® is our registered trademark for one of our ESAs, a protein that stimulates red blood cell production. Red blood cells transport oxygen to all cells of the body. Without adequate amounts of erythropoietin, the red blood cell count is reduced. A deficient red blood cell count can result in anemia, a condition where insufficient oxygen is delivered to the body’s organs and tissues. Anemia can be associated with CRF, both in patients on dialysis and not on dialysis. Anemia can also result from chemotherapy treatments for patients with non-myeloid malignancies.  We were granted an exclusive license by Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (“KA”), a joint venture between Kirin Holdings Company, Limited (“Kirin”) and Amgen (see “Joint Ventures and Business Relationships — Kirin Holdings Company, Limited”), to manufacture and market darbepoetin alfa in the United States, all European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, North Africa and the Middle East.  We market Aranesp® primarily in the United States and Europe. Aranesp® was initially launched in 2001 in the United States and Europe for the treatment of anemia associated with CRF (both in patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis) and is also indicated for the treatment of CIA in patients with non-myeloid malignancies.  Worldwide Aranesp® sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $3.1 billion, $3.6 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. As a result of certain of the regulatory and reimbursement developments discussed above in the “Key Developments” section, worldwide Aranesp® sales and, in particular, sales in the U.S. supportive cancer care setting, have and will continue to be materially adversely affected.  Our outstanding material patents for darbepoetin alfa are described in the table below.             Territory    General Subject Matter   Expiration  U.S.   Glycosylation analogs of erythropoietin proteins   5/15/2024  Europe(1)   Glycosylation analogs of erythropoietin proteins   10/12/2010  Europe(1)   Glycosylation analogs of erythropoietin proteins   8/16/2014       (1)  In some cases, these European patents may also be entitled to supplemental protection in one or more countries in Europe and the length of any such extension will vary by country.  Our principal European patent relating to Epoetin alfa expired on December 12, 2004. Although we do not market EPOGEN® in Europe, upon expiration of this patent, some companies have and other companies may receive approval for and market biosimilar or other products to compete with Aranesp® in Europe, presenting additional competition, as further discussed below.  Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with chemotherapy and nephrology could negatively impact product sales of Aranesp®. The following table reflects companies and their currently marketed products that primarily compete with Aranesp® in the United States and Europe in the supportive cancer care and nephrology segments, unless otherwise indicated.    9    Table of Contents          Territory    Competitor Marketed Product    Competitor  U.S.   PROCRIT®(1)   J&J  Europe   EPREX®/ERYPO®   Janssen-Cilag(2)  Europe   NeoRecormon®   Roche  Europe   Retacrit™(3)/Silapo®(3)    Hospira Enterprises B.V.

In the United States, Aranesp® also competes with EPOGEN®, primarily in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinic setting. In addition to competition from the above-noted marketed products, the following product candidates could compete with Aranesp® in the future. Affymax Inc. (“Affymax”) and Takeda are co-developing Hematide™, an ESA for the treatment of anemia in renal patients. FibroGen is developing FG-2216 and FG-4592, orally active ESAs, for the treatment of anemia and is also studying FG-4592 for the treatment in anemia of chronic kidney disease (“CKD”). Ratiopharm is developing a biosimilar ESA, EpoTheta, expected to launch in the EU in 2009. Additionally, in December 2008, Merck & Company, Inc. (“Merck”) announced the formation of a new biotech division, Merck Bioventures, which is developing a late-stage pegylated ESA (MK-2578), which they have announced they expect to launch in 2012.  EPOGEN® (Epoetin alfa)  EPOGEN® is our registered trademark for our recombinant human erythropoietin product, a protein that stimulates red blood cell production. A reduced red blood cell count can result in anemia (see “— Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa)”). People with CRF suffer from anemia because they do not produce sufficient amounts of erythropoietin, which is normally produced in healthy kidneys.  We were granted an exclusive license to manufacture and market recombinant human erythropoietin in the United States under a licensing agreement with KA. We have retained exclusive rights to market EPOGEN® in the United States for dialysis patients. We granted Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation (which has assigned its rights under the Product License Agreement to Ortho Biotech) a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all markets other than dialysis (see “Joint Ventures and Business Relationships — Johnson & Johnson”).  We launched EPOGEN® in the United States in 1989 for the treatment of anemia associated with CRF for patients who are on dialysis. We market EPOGEN® for the treatment of anemic adult and pediatric patients with CRF who are on dialysis. EPOGEN® is indicated for elevating or maintaining the red blood cell level (as determined by hematocrit or Hb measurements) and decreasing the need for blood transfusions in these patients.  EPOGEN® sales in the United States were $2.5 billion for each of the three years ended December 31, 2008.    10    Table of Contents Our outstanding material patents for Epoetin alfa are described in the table below.

In the United States, EPOGEN® and Aranesp® compete with each other, primarily in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinic setting, and there was a conversion from EPOGEN® to Aranesp® in this setting, however we believe that the conversion has stabilized. In addition, Affymax and Takeda are co-developing Hematide™, an ESA for the treatment of anemia in renal patients. FibroGen is developing FG-2216 and FG-4592, orally active ESAs for the treatment of anemia. Additionally, in December 2008, Merck announced the formation of a new biotech division, Merck Bioventures, which is developing a late stage pegylated ESA (MK-2578), which they have announced they expect to launch in 2012.  Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim)/NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim)  Neulasta® is our registered trademark for a pegylated protein that selectively stimulates production of certain white blood cells known as neutrophils and is based on the Filgrastim molecule. Neutrophils defend against infection. NEUPOGEN® is our registered trademark for our recombinant-methionyl human G-CSF, a protein that also selectively stimulates production of neutrophils. Treatments for various diseases and diseases themselves can result in extremely low numbers of neutrophils, a condition called neutropenia. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy, one treatment option for individuals with certain types of cancers, targets cell types that grow rapidly, such as tumor cells. Normal cells that divide rapidly, such as those in the bone marrow that become neutrophils, are also vulnerable to the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy, resulting in neutropenia with an increased risk of severe infection. Very often, neutropenia is the dose limiting side effect of chemotherapy and can thus be responsible for a reduction in the amount of chemotherapy that can be administered safely. Such reductions in chemotherapy dose can compromise the effectiveness of chemotherapy on the cancer it is being used to treat, with the result of a higher treatment failure rate. As mentioned above, the pegfilgrastim molecule is based on the Filgrastim molecule. A polyethylene glycol molecule (“PEG”) is added to enlarge the Filgrastim molecule, thereby extending its half-life and causing it to be removed more slowly from the body. Because pegfilgrastim is eliminated through binding to its receptor on neutrophils and their precursors, pegfilgrastim remains in the circulation until neutrophil recovery has occurred. This neutrophil-mediated clearance allows for administration as a single dose per chemotherapy cycle, compared with NEUPOGEN®, which requires more frequent dosing. Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® are prescribed more frequently in the curative setting, in which myelosuppressive chemotherapy is administered with the intent to cure cancer, rather than in the palliative setting, in which myelosuppressive chemotherapy is administered to treat other complications of cancer by managing tumor growth.  We were granted an exclusive license to manufacture and market pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand under a licensing agreement with KA (see “Joint Ventures and Business Relationships — Kirin Holdings Company, Limited”).  We market Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® primarily in the United States and Europe. Filgrastim is also marketed under the brand name GRANULOKINE® in Italy. Neulasta® was initially launched in the United States and Europe in 2002 and is indicated for reducing the incidence of infection associated with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies. Administration of Neulasta® in all cycles of chemotherapy is approved for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy associated with at least a 17% risk of febrile neutropenia. NEUPOGEN® was initially launched in the United States and Europe in 1991. NEUPOGEN® is indicated for reducing the incidence of infection as manifested by febrile neutropenia for patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy; reducing the duration of neutropenia and neutropenia-related consequences for patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation; reducing the incidence and duration of neutropenia-related consequences in symptomatic patients with congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia or     11    Table of Contents  idiopathic neutropenia (collectively, severe chronic neutropenia); mobilizing peripheral blood progenitor cells (“PBPC”) in cancer patients who have undergone myeloablative chemotherapy for stem cell transplantation; and reducing the recovery time of neutrophils and the duration of fever following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”).  Worldwide Neulasta® sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $3.3 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. Worldwide NEUPOGEN® sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.

Upon expiration of this patent, some companies have and other companies may receive approval for and market biosimilar products and other products to compete with Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® in Europe, presenting additional competition, as further discussed below.  Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® could face competition in some circumstances from companies marketing or developing treatments for neutropenia associated with chemotherapy, for bone marrow and PBPC transplant patients, and AML. NEUPOGEN® competes with Neulasta® in the United States and Europe. U.S. and international NEUPOGEN® sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to Neulasta®. However, we believe that the conversion in the United States is substantially complete and that a significant amount of the conversion in Europe had already occurred.

Enbrel®  (etanercept)  ENBREL is our registered trademark for our TNF receptor fusion protein that inhibits its binding to TNF receptors, which can result in a significant reduction in inflammatory activity. TNF is one of the chemical     12    Table of Contents  messengers that help regulate the inflammatory process. When the body produces too much TNF, it overwhelms the immune system’s ability to control inflammation of the joints or of psoriasis-affected skin areas. ENBREL is similar to a protein that the body produces naturally, and like this protein, it binds and deactivates certain TNF molecules before they can trigger inflammation.  We acquired the rights to ENBREL in July 2002 as part of our acquisition of Immunex Corporation (“Immunex”).  We market ENBREL under a co-promotion agreement with Wyeth in the United States and Canada (see “Joint Ventures and Business Relationships — Wyeth”). The rights to market ENBREL outside of the United States and Canada are reserved to Wyeth. ENBREL was initially launched in November 1998 by Immunex for the treatment of RA. In addition, ENBREL is now indicated for the treatment of adult patients with the following conditions: moderately to severely active RA; chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy; active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis. ENBREL is also approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active polyarticular-course juvenile RA in patients who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying medicines.  ENBREL sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $3.6 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively.

In December 2007, J&J filed a BLA with the FDA and a market authorization application (“MAA”) with the EMEA for CNTO 1275 (ustekinumab) to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Although the DODAC unanimously recommended CNTO 1275 for approval, in December 2008, the FDA declined approval and requested additional information from J&J. J&J is also developing CNTO 148 (golimumab) for the treatment of RA. Additionally, a number of companies have cytokine inhibitors in development, including GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GlaxoSmithKline”), Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”), Repligen Corporation and Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Roche filed a BLA for its RA candidate Actemra (tocilizumab) in November 2007 and received a complete response letter from the FDA in September 2008, requesting additional data on the labeling and manufacture of the drug. Abbott is developing ABT-874, which is a psoriasis drug, and is in phase 3 trials. UCB has partnered with Nektar Therapeutics to develop Cimzia® (PEGylated anti-TNF) for the treatment of RA. On January 5, 2009, the FDA issued a complete response letter relating to the BLA of Cimzia® for treatment of RA requesting additional information.  Other  Our other marketed products are principally comprised of Sensipar® (cinacalcet), Vectibix® (panitumumab) and Nplate® (romiplostim).  Sensipar® (cinacalcet)  Sensipar® is our registered trademark in the United States and Mimpara® is our registered trademark in Europe, for our first small molecule medicine used in treating CKD patients on dialysis who produce too much parathyroid hormone, a condition known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. In 2004, Sensipar®/Mimpara® was approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients on dialysis and for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. We market Sensipar®/Mimpara® primarily in the United States and Europe.  Sensipar® sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $597 million, $463 million and $321 million, respectively.

The lawsuit is based on the Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) filed by Teva and Barr which seeks approval to market generic versions of Sensipar®. (See Note 10, “Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) These generic versions could compete with Sensipar® in the future.  Vectibix® (panitumumab)  Vectibix® is our trademark for our first entirely human monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing mCRC after disease progression on, or following fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens. EGFr is a protein that plays an important role in cancer cell signaling and is over-expressed in many human cancers. Vectibix® is an entirely human monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to EGFrs and interferes with signals that might otherwise stimulate growth and survival of the cancer cell. The goal of developing entirely human monoclonal antibodies is to offer effective targeted therapies with lessened risk of immune response against these agents. Vectibix® received FDA approval in September 2006. On December 5, 2007, the European Commission granted a conditional marketing authorization for Vectibix®, which was renewed in December 2008, as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing mCRC with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS genes after failure of standard chemotherapy regimens. We acquired full ownership of Vectibix® as part of our acquisition of Abgenix, Inc. (“Abgenix”) in April 2006.  Nplate® (romiplostim)  On August 22, 2008, the FDA approved Nplate®, the first platelet producer for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in splenectomized (spleen removed) and non-splenectomized adults with chronic ITP. Nplate®, the first FDA approved peptibody protein, works by raising and sustaining platelet counts. On February 6, 2009, we announced that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Nplate® for the treatment of splenectomized adult chronic ITP patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). In the EU, Nplate® may also be considered as second line treatment for adult non-splenectomized ITP patients where surgery is contra-indicated.  Product candidates  We are currently studying new product candidates, including denosumab, and currently marketed products for new indications, which, if approved, we expect will enter into highly competitive markets. If successful, these product candidates will face substantial competition from products currently marketed as well as those under development by other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. For example, the bone loss setting, in which denosumab would compete, is currently comprised of three therapeutic classes: bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators and anabolic agents. Competitive intensity will increase in the bone loss setting with the expected approval of new agents. If denosumab is approved, we would need to significantly expand our sales and marketing capabilities to support its successful launch.  The following table reflects other companies and their currently marketed products that will compete with denosumab, if approved:               Amgen ProductCandidate    Therapeutic Area    Competitor MarketedProduct    Potential Competitor   Denosumab   PMO   FOSAMAX®   Merck   Denosumab   PMO   Actonel®   Procter & Gamble/Aventis   Denosumab   PMO   Boniva®/Bonviva®   Roche/GlaxoSmithKline   Denosumab   PMO   Evista®    Eli Lilly and Company (“Eli Lilly”)   Denosumab   PMO   Forteo®/Forsteo™   Eli Lilly   Denosumab   PMO   Miacalcin®   Novartis   Denosumab   PMO   Aclasta®/Reclast®   Novartis   Denosumab   PMO   generic ALN   Teva   Denosumab   Oncology   Zometa®   Novartis   Denosumab   Oncology   Aredia®   Novartis    15    Table of Contents Merck’s patent covering the use of FOSAMAX® to treat bone loss expired in the United States in February 2008. Following the patent expiry, generic ALN became available from Teva, as noted in the table above, and has also become available from other companies.  Postmarketing Safety Activities  We must conduct extensive clinical trials designed to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in order to file for regulatory approval to market a product. After we have obtained approval to market our products, we monitor adverse events from the use of our products and report these events to regulatory agencies, along with information from postmarketing surveillance or studies. We may utilize other research approaches to learn or confirm information about our marketed products, including observational studies and patient registries, and may engage in risk minimization activities such as physician education initiatives and patient and patient advocacy group initiatives. We may also conduct, or be required by regulatory agencies to conduct, further clinical trials to provide additional information on our marketed products’ safety and efficacy. These additional trials may include, among other things, studying different doses or schedules of administration that were used in previous studies, use in other patient populations or other stages of the disease or use over a longer period of time. Additional trials of this nature are sometimes required by regulatory agencies as a condition of their approval to market our products; such trials are sometimes referred to as PMCs. Regulatory agencies may also request or require that we conduct specific studies in order to identify or assess possible safety risks of our marketed products that are observed or suggested by available scientific data.  Certain ESA Postmarketing Commitments  Following the ODAC meeting in May 2004, we proposed a pharmacovigilance program comprised of five ongoing studies for Aranesp®, which sought to explore the use of ESAs in settings different from those outlined in the FDA approved label. These studies were subsequently designated by the FDA as PMCs. One of the five studies, the 20010145 (“145”) study, was an Amgen sponsored study, with the other four studies being investigator-sponsored studies. The following table summarizes the five studies:                 Sponsor   Study    Tumor Type   Target Hb(g/dL)    Study Results         Amgen   20010145   Small cell lung   13    At median follow-up of 2 1/2 years, ESA and placebo group had similar PFS and overall survival; PFS based on blinded central review similar between ESA and placebo(1)          DAHANCA   DAHANCA-10(2)   Head and neck   14-15.5    5-year locoregional control poorer in ESA group; No significant difference in overall survival(1)         AGO   PREPARE   Neoadjuvant breast   12.5-13    Decreased 3-year relapse-free and overall survival in the ESA group(1)         GELA(3)    LNH-03-6B   NHL(4)   13-15 initially,amended to13-14    At 1 year, ESA and control groups had similar overall survival and event-free survival(5)         WSG(6)   ARA-03/ARAPlus   Adjuvant breast   13-14    Interim safety results published(7)        (1)  Final results are expected in 2009.

The final study report is expected in 2011.  In addition, Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development (“J&JPRD”), a subsidiary of J&J, and/or its investigators have conducted numerous studies proposed at the 2004 ODAC meeting including: the EPO-GBR-7 and RTOG-9903 studies in head and neck cancer (“HNC”), the EPO-GER-22 and EPO-CAN-20 studies in non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”), the EPO-CAN-17 and EPO-GER-7 studies in breast cancer and the EPO-GER-8/AGO-NOGGO study in cervical cancer. All of the above studies are closed to enrollment and summary results were submitted to the FDA. In addition, J&JPRD’s EPO-ANE-3010 study in breast cancer is ongoing and is designated as an FDA PMC.  Based on our ongoing discussions with the FDA in response to the May 2007 ODAC meeting, we and J&JPRD have carefully considered potential new study designs to determine the effects of ESAs on survival and tumor outcomes in anemic patients with metastatic cancer receiving concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy. We have submitted an Aranesp® study protocol to the FDA and plan to initiate the study in 2009.  Other Postmarketing Commitments  In addition to our ESA products, we have ongoing PMC studies for all of our marketed products. In particular, we have several large, ongoing studies involving ENBREL, which include trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its long-term use.  Other Safety Activities  The FDAAA gave the FDA authority to require us and other companies to develop and implement a REMS for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. The FDA may require the submission of a REMS before a product is approved, or after approval based on new safety information, including new analyses of existing safety information. A REMS may include a medication guide, patient package insert, a plan for communication with healthcare providers or other elements the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the product, which could include imposing certain restrictions on distribution or use of a product. A REMS must include a timetable for submission of assessments of the strategy at specified time intervals. Failure to comply with a REMS, including the submission of a required assessment or any modification to a REMS, may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties. We currently have approved REMS for ENBREL and Nplate®. Additionally, in response to the FDA’s request under authority prescribed by the FDAAA, we have submitted a proposed REMS program for the class of ESAs and an update to the existing REMS for ENBREL.  Marketing and Distribution  We maintain sales and marketing forces primarily in the United States, Europe and Canada to support our currently marketed products. We market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. We also market certain products directly to consumers through direct-to-consumer print and television advertising. In addition, for certain of our products, we promote programs to increase public awareness of the health risks associated with the diseases these products treat, as well as providing support to various patient education and support programs in the related therapeutic areas.  In the United States, we sell primarily to wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products. We utilize these wholesale distributors as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In early 2008, ENBREL’s distribution model was converted from primarily being shipped directly to pharmacies to a wholesale distribution model similar to our other products. Outside the United States, Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® are principally distributed to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits, requiring letters of credit, and obtaining credit insurance, as we deem appropriate.    17    Table of Contents We had product sales to three large wholesaler customers each accounting for more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. On a combined basis, these distributors accounted for 71% and 87% of worldwide gross revenues and U.S. gross product sales, respectively, for 2008, as noted in the following table (dollar amounts in millions):                     Years ended December 31,      2008   2007   2006   AmerisourceBergen Corporation               Gross product sales   $ 7,099   $ 6,124   $ 6,523   % of total gross revenues     37%     31%     35%   % of U.S. gross product sales     46%     39%     42%   McKesson Corporation               Gross product sales   $ 3,594   $ 2,398   $ 2,427   % of total gross revenues     19%     12%     13%   % of U.S. gross product sales     23%     15%     15%   Cardinal Health, Inc.

Under a co-promotion agreement with Wyeth, we and Wyeth market ENBREL in the United States and Canada for all approved indications. Additionally, we have entered into agreements with third-parties to market certain of our products including Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® in certain geographic areas outside of the United States.  Reimbursement  Sales of all of our principal products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, including governments and private insurance plans. Most patients receiving our products are covered by government and/or private payor healthcare programs. Governments may regulate access to, prices or reimbursement levels of our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products, and private insurers may be influenced by government reimbursement methodologies. Worldwide use of our products may be affected by these cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers or patients in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce or reallocate healthcare expenditures. An increasing focus on patient access controls and cost containment by public and private insurers has resulted, and may continue to result, in reduced reimbursement rates for our products. In addition, we believe the new U.S. presidential administration, together with Congress, will shape U.S. healthcare policy in the coming months and years, and we expect that healthcare reform efforts could include long-term changes to coverage and reimbursement that may have a significant impact on our business.  U.S. Reimbursement System  In the United States, healthcare providers, including doctors, hospitals and other healthcare professionals and facilities, are reimbursed for their services by the government through Medicare and other forms of public health insurance and private insurers, which are funded primarily through the payment of premiums from individuals, businesses and the government and taxes from individuals and businesses. The public and private components of this multi-payor system are described below.  Medicare and Other Forms of Public Health Insurance  Medicare is a federal program administered and reimbursed by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities and chronic illnesses. The CMS administer     18    Table of Contents  Medicare (as well as Medicaid, described below) and are responsible for issuing Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual instructions as well as manual policy updates, codes for drugs and local coverage decisions. Generally, a national coverage determination (“NCD”) is a national policy statement granting, limiting or excluding Medicare coverage for a specific medical item or service. The primary Medicare programs that affect reimbursement for our products are Medicare Part B, which covers physician services and outpatient care, and Medicare Part D, which offers an outpatient prescription drug benefit.  Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B provides limited benefits for fee-for-service outpatient drugs that are furnished “incident to” a physician’s services. Generally, “incident to” drugs and biologicals are covered only if they satisfy certain criteria, including that they are of the type that is not usually self-administered by the patient and they are reasonable and necessary for medically accepted diagnosis or treatment. Medicare Part B also covers some drugs pursuant to a specific statutory directive, such as blood-clotting factors and certain immunosuppressive drugs, erythropoietin, and certain oral cancer drugs, if they fall under a specific statutory benefit category and they are “safe and effective” as established by an FDA approval. Many of our primary products, including EPOGEN®, Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®, are currently covered under Medicare Part B (as well as other government programs). In addition, most patients with end stage renal disease (“ESRD”), regardless of age, are eligible for coverage of their dialysis treatment through the ESRD Program under Medicare Part B, the primary payor for dialysis treatment. Because Medicare Part B is the primary payor for dialysis treatment, reimbursement for products, such as EPOGEN®, that are typically administered in dialysis centers is particularly sensitive to changes in Medicare reimbursement policy.  Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D provides a voluntary prescription drug benefit for elderly and disabled people who are eligible for Medicare. This coverage is available through various plans that provide insurance coverage for prescription drugs for a monthly premium. The list of prescription drugs covered by Medicare Part D plans varies by plan, but drug lists maintained by individual plans must cover a required range of prescription drugs and biologicals needed by Medicare beneficiaries. To encourage competition, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act (“MMA”) stipulates that Part D plans have at least two drugs in each unique therapeutic category, subject to certain exceptions. Medicare patients who access ENBREL and Sensipar® under retail coverage where they are primarily accessed are covered by Medicare Part D.  Medicaid. Medicaid is a state-administered program designed for the low-income and disabled. Under federal law, states must cover low-income children, pregnant women, parents, disabled and seniors, and states have the option of expanding eligibility beyond these groups of patients. Medicaid is financed jointly by the states and federal government through taxes. Medicaid offers a broad set of benefits, including prescription drugs. Certain drug rebates for our products may be available to state governments under Medicaid. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, and to the extent that access to and reimbursement for products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”)  Private Health Insurance  Employer-sponsored insurance. Employer-sponsored insurance represents the main avenue by which Americans receive private health insurance. Many employers provide health insurance as part of the benefits package for employees. Insurance plans are administered by private companies, both for-profit and not-for-profit, and some companies are “self-insured” (i.e., they pay for all healthcare costs incurred by employees directly through a plan administered by a third party). Generally, employer-sponsored insurance premiums are paid primarily by employers and secondarily by employees.  Individual market. The individual market covers part of the population that is self-employed or retired. In addition, it covers some people who are unable to obtain insurance through their employer. In contrast to the employer-sponsored insurance, the individual market allows health insurance companies to deny people coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The plans are administered by private insurance companies. Individuals pay an insurance premium out-of-pocket for coverage, and benefits vary widely according to plan specifications.    19    Table of Contents Reimbursement of Our Principal Products  Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. Medicare and Medicaid payment policies for drugs and biologicals are subject to various laws and regulations. The Medicare program covers Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®, when administered in the physician clinic setting and the hospital outpatient and dialysis settings, under Part B, and reimburses providers using a payment methodology developed under the MMA based on a fixed percentage of each product’s average sales price (“ASP”). ASP is calculated by the manufacturer based on a statutorily defined formula and submitted to CMS. A product’s ASP is calculated and reported to CMS on a quarterly basis and therefore may change each quarter. The ASP in effect for a given quarter (the “Current Period”) is based upon certain historical sales and sales incentive data covering a statutorily defined period of time preceding the Current Period. CMS publishes the ASPs for products in advance of the quarter in which they go into effect. In the calculation of ASP, CMS currently allows manufacturers to make reasonable assumptions consistent with the general requirements and the intent of the Medicare statute and regulations and their customary business practices and in the future CMS may provide more specific guidance. (See “Items 1A. Risk Factors — Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, and to the extent that access to and reimbursement for products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”)  As of January 1, 2008, Medicare payment in the hospital outpatient setting reimbursed each product at 105% of its ASP (sometimes referred to as “ASP+5%”). For 2009, and effective January 1, 2009, CMS established the payment rate in the hospital outpatient setting at ASP+4% and CMS has the regulatory authority to further reduce the outpatient hospital payment formula in future years. The extent to which commercial payors adopt the use of ASP as a payment methodology is still evolving and is often based on the relationship between the provider and the insurer.  Dialysis Reimbursement. Dialysis providers in the United States are primarily reimbursed for EPOGEN® by the federal government through the ESRD Program. The ESRD Program reimburses approved providers for 80% of allowed dialysis costs; the remainder is paid by other sources, including patients, state Medicaid programs, private insurance, and to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. The ESRD Program reimbursement methodology is established by federal law and is monitored and implemented by CMS. Medicare reimburses for separately billable dialysis drugs administered in both free-standing and hospital-based dialysis centers, including EPOGEN® and Aranesp®, at ASP+6%, using the same payment amount methodology used in the physician clinic setting. Any changes to the ASP calculations directly affect the Medicare reimbursement for our products administered in the physician clinic setting, dialysis facility and hospital outpatient setting. These calculations are reviewed quarterly for completeness and based on such review, we have on occasion restated our reported ASPs to reflect calculation changes both prospectively and retroactively. For example, partially as a result of our methodology changes, our ASP reimbursement rate for EPOGEN® was reduced for the third quarter of 2007.  ENBREL Reimbursement. The majority of prescription claims for ENBREL are paid through private insurance companies. Under Medicare, ENBREL is reimbursed through the Part D program, although less then 10% of prescriptions are reimbursed through Medicare.  Recent Medicare Reforms. On July 15, 2008, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (the “MIPPA”) became law. The MIPPA contained a number of Medicare and Medicaid reforms, including a broader payment bundle for dialysis services and drugs which will require CMS, beginning in 2011, to establish a bundled Medicare payment rate that includes dialysis services and drug/labs that are currently separately billed. The new bundled rate will include dialysis services covered under the current composite rate, including all injectable drugs commonly provided during dialysis treatment, including ESAs, intravenous (“IV”) iron, and IV vitamin D, as well as “oral equivalent” forms of these IV drugs. The bundled reimbursement rate will be phased in over a four year period in equal increments starting in 2011. It is possible that individual providers could elect to permanently move to a full Medicare bundled payment in 2011. CMS will also be required to establish a quality incentive program that begins concurrently with bundling in 2011 and which subjects facilities to up to a 2% annual reduction in Medicare reimbursement for failure to meet or exceed CMS quality performance standards, including performance standards related to anemia management and dialysis adequacy.    20    Table of Contents ESA Reimbursement Developments. Since April 1, 2006, the Medicare reimbursement for ESAs administered to dialysis patients has been subject to a revised EMP, the Medicare payment review mechanism used by CMS to monitor EPOGEN® and Aranesp® utilization and appropriate hematocrit outcomes of dialysis patients. The EMP was revised, effective January 1, 2008, requiring a 50% reduction in Medicare reimbursement if a patient’s Hb is above 13 g/dL for three or more consecutive months. In addition, the revised EMP reduces the monthly dosing limits to 400,000 IUs of EPOGEN®, from 500,000 IUs, and to 1,200 mcgs of Aranesp®, from 1,500 mcgs. The implementation of the revised EMP and ESA labeling changes led to a decline in EPOGEN® sales for the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007 primarily due to a decline in both overall utilization and as well as average dosing per patient. However, this dose decline subsequently stabilized. (See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — EPOGEN®.”)  On March 14, 2007, CMS announced that the agency began a review of all Medicare policies related to the administration of ESAs in non-renal disease applications as part of a national coverage analysis (“NCA”), which is generally CMS’ first step toward developing an NCD. On May 14, 2007, CMS issued a proposed NCD that was open for public comment through June 13, 2007. On July 30, 2007, CMS issued its Decision Memorandum which was substantially altered from the proposed NCD. On January 14, 2008, CMS issued changes to its Medicare NCD Manual, adding the ESA Decision Memorandum, effective for claims with dates of service on and after July 30, 2007 with an implementation date of April 7, 2008. The Decision Memorandum determined that ESA treatment was not reasonable and necessary for certain clinical conditions, and established Medicare coverage parameters for FDA-approved ESA use in oncology.  We believe that the restrictions in the Decision Memorandum changed the way ESAs are used in clinical practice, for example, by decreasing the number of treated patients, the average ESA dose and the duration of ESA therapy. We believe this restriction on reimbursement of ESAs in the Decision Memorandum has had a material adverse effect on the use, reimbursement and sales of Aranesp®, and our business and results of operations. In addition, based on our knowledge, although no private payors have fully implemented the Decision Memorandum to date, many private payors have implemented portions of the Decision Memorandum that most commonly reflect the prescriber package insert. Further, we believe many healthcare providers have reduced ESA utilization for all of their patients regardless of insurance coverage.  On September 11, 2007, the FDA held a joint meeting of the Cardiovascular-Renal Drug Advisory Committee (“CRDAC”) and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee (“DSaRMAC”) to evaluate the safety data on ESA use in renal disease. On July 31, 2008, CMS issued a listing of potential topics for future NCDs as a step to increase transparency in the NCD process and which included as potential topics the use of ESAs in ESRD and CKD. CMS has not announced whether it will proceed to a NCD for ESAs in ESRD or CKD and we cannot predict whether ESAs in the renal setting will be the subject of a future NCD, however, any final NCD for ESAs in the renal setting, which may include non-coverage and/or new dosing and treatment restrictions similar to those proposed in the Decision Memorandum for treatment of anemia in oncology with ESAs, would negatively affect use, reduce reimbursement and coverage, negatively affect product sales of our ESA products and may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Reimbursement Outside the United States  Generally, in Europe and other countries outside the United States, the government-sponsored healthcare system has traditionally been the primary payor of healthcare costs of patients. Over the past several years, the reimbursement environment in Europe has become very challenging, with the advent of Health Technology Assessment organizations (e.g., National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (“NICE”) in the United Kingdom) that make determinations of coverage and reimbursement based upon both the clinical value as well as cost-effectiveness of a product. With increased budgetary constraints, payors in many countries employ a variety of cost-containment measures that can include reference pricing (i.e., setting the reimbursement rate for a given class of agents at the lowest price within the class), generic substitution and mandatory price cuts. In many countries, the influence of regional and hospital payors also contributes to the level of product access that is afforded     21    Table of Contents  to patients. In the future, these trends are likely to continue. Additionally, we anticipate that many payors will request manufacturers to provide alternative pricing mechanisms (e.g., payment caps) that facilitate greater predictability of payor budgets.  Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates  Our vision is to deliver therapeutics that can make a meaningful difference in patients’ lives. Therefore, we focus our R&D on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness in the areas of oncology, inflammation, bone, metabolic disorders and neuroscience. We take a modality-independent approach to R&D — that is, we identify targets, and then choose the modality best suited to address a specific target. As such, our discovery research programs may yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as proteins, including monoclonal antibodies and peptibodies, or small molecules.  To execute our clinical trial programs, we need to maintain an effective development organization and associated R&D support organizations. We conduct clinical trial activities with both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. In order to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of geographic locations where we have more limited experience conducting clinical trials, including Russia, India, East Asia and some Central and South American countries. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.”)  We have major R&D centers in several locations throughout the United States and in the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers in Canada and Germany, and smaller development facilities throughout Europe and in Canada, Australia, Mexico, Hong Kong and India (see “Item 2. Properties”). As part of our restructuring efforts, we have also moderated expansion of certain R&D facilities throughout the United States, including abandoning leases for certain R&D facilities that will no longer be used in our operations.  In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal R&D efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and technology rights and establish R&D collaborations, which enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&D capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. (See Note 8, “Acquisitions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We may not be able to develop commercial products.”)  Some of our competitors are actively engaged in R&D in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is significantly dependent upon the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, contributing to the product’s eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market is expected to be important to our competitive position.  Various public and privately owned companies, research organizations, academic institutions and governmental agencies conduct a significant amount of R&D in the biotechnology industry. We face competition in our collaborative arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from these entities. Accordingly, we may have difficulty entering into collaborative arrangements and licensing or acquiring technologies, product candidates and marketed products on acceptable terms.    22    Table of Contents The following table is a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 6, 2009.

Denosumab  Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets a ligand known as RANKL (that binds to a receptor known as RANK) which is a key mediator of osteoclast formation, function, and survival. Denosumab is being studied across a range of conditions including osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, bone metastases, multiple myeloma and RA.  The overall denosumab program remains on track with all completed PMO and treatment-induced bone loss (prostate and breast cancer) phase 3 studies having met primary and key secondary endpoints. The following chart is an overview of the phase 3 clinical development program for denosumab:               Program Area     Indication    EnrollmentStatus     Project Data Availability   Osteoporosis    PMO Treatment (versus placebo)   Complete   Received   Osteoporosis    PMO Treatment (versus ALN)   Complete   Received   Osteoporosis    PMO Prevention   Complete   Received   Osteoporosis    PMO Transition (from ALN)   Complete   Received   Oncology    Treatment-Induced Bone Loss-Prostate Cancer   Complete   Received   Oncology    Treatment-Induced Bone Loss-Breast Cancer   Complete   Received   Oncology    Bone Metastates-Prostate Cancer   Complete   2010(1)   Oncology    Skeletal-Related Events-Breast Cancer   Complete   3rd Quarter of 2009(1)   Oncology    Skeletal-Related Events-Solid Tumors/multiple myeloma   Complete   4th Quarter of 2009(1)   Oncology    Skeletal-Related Events-Prostate Cancer   Complete   2010(1)       (1)  Event-driven study and consequently data availability may vary as a result  Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Trials  In a three-year phase 3 pivotal study of approximately 7,800 women with PMO (Study 216), twice-yearly subcutaneous injections with denosumab resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures compared with placebo treatment. In addition, women receiving denosumab experienced a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of new non-vertebral and hip fractures compared with those receiving placebo.  In a two-year pivotal phase 3 study of 332 postmenopausal women with low bone mass (osteopenia), treatment with denosumab increased BMD at all sites measured compared with placebo.  In a one-year non-pivotal phase 3, head-to-head, double-blind study in 1,189 postmenopausal women comparing the effects of denosumab versus weekly oral ALN (FOSAMAX®), treatment with denosumab resulted in significantly greater BMD gains at all sites measured compared with ALN.  In a one-year phase 3 head-to-head, double-blind study (Study 234) comparing the effects of denosumab in 504 women with PMO transitioned from weekly oral ALN versus continued ALN therapy, treatment with denosumab resulted in significantly greater BMD gains at all sites measured compared with continued treatment with ALN.  In all four PMO studies, the incidence and types of adverse events were generally similar across the treatment groups. The most common adverse events included back pain, arthralgia and nasopharyngitis.  Treatment-Induced Bone Loss Trials  In a pivotal phase 3 study of more than 1,400 men undergoing ADT for non-metastatic prostate cancer (Study 138), denosumab treatment produced statistically significantly greater increases in BMD across the     24    Table of Contents  skeleton compared with placebo. During the 36-month evaluation period, men receiving denosumab experienced less than half the incidence of new vertebral fractures compared with those receiving placebo, a statistically significant finding. Furthermore, in the denosumab arm there were fewer non-vertebral fractures over the 36-month period.  In the pivotal phase 3 trial of 252 women with non-metastatic breast cancer and low bone mass receiving AI therapy, patients experienced significant increases in BMD across the skeleton when given denosumab once every six months irrespective of duration of AI therapy.  In both studies, the incidence and types of adverse and serious adverse events observed generally were similar between the denosumab and placebo groups. The most common adverse events across the treatment arms included arthralgia, back pain, constipation, and pain in extremity.  License applications for PMO and patients undergoing hormone ablation for either prostate or breast cancer were submitted with the FDA in December 2008 and EMEA in January 2009.  Other Settings  Denosumab is also being studied in patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, other solid tumors or multiple myeloma for treatment to prevent skeletal-related events (“SRE”). The Company expects to review the complete data set for SREs in breast cancer and solid tumors in the second half of 2009. The phase 3 study evaluating denosumab in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer to prevent bone metastases is ongoing.  Vectibix® (panitumumab)  Panitumumab (Vectibix®) is a fully-human monoclonal antibody antagonist of the EGFr pathway. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment.  In December 2008, we presented data to the ODAC regarding the utility of KRAS as a predictive biomarker for Vectibix® monotherapy. We performed a biomarker analysis which indicated that in mCRC patients who have failed all other chemotherapeutic regimens, the efficacy of Vectibix® monotherapy is confined to patients with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS tumors. Specifically, patients with non-mutated KRAS tumors treated with Vectibix® monotherapy have shown a significantly prolonged PFS compared to best supportive care alone. Indeed, patients whose tumors contained KRAS mutations did not seem to benefit from Vectibix® treatment. As a result of our KRAS analyses, the statistical analysis plans of the phase 3 studies of Vectibix® in the treatment of first and second line colorectal cancer, which were initiated in 2006, have been amended. These study changes are expected to allow the Company to assess the utility of Vectibix® in patients according to tumor KRAS mutational status; data from these phase 3 studies are expected to be available in 2009.  In December 2007, we announced that the European Commission has granted a conditional marketing authorization for Vectibix® as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens. In December 2008, the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) adopted a positive opinion for the renewal of this conditional marketing authorization.  In May 2008, we presented data from the phase 2 Panitumumab Regimen Evaluation in Colorectal Cancer to Estimate Primary Response to Treatment (“PRECEPT”) trial and phase 1 data evaluating panitumumab in head and neck cancer at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) and in July 2008, we disclosed that the phase 2 Skin Toxicity Evaluation Protocol with Panitumumab (“STEPP”) study showed that preemptive treatment reduced the incidence rate of skin toxicities without additional side effects. In 2007, we initiated a phase 3 study for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (“SCCHN”) as well as two randomized phase 2 studies in locally advanced SCCHN testing panitumumab in combination with chemoradiotherapy or with radiotherapy alone. Panitumumab is also being investigated in combination with other investigational anti-cancer therapies.    25    Table of Contents Nplate® (romiplostim)  Romiplostim (Nplate®) is a peptibody agonist of the thrombopoietin (“TPO”) receptor.  Nplate® is the first FDA-approved agent that acts directly to increase platelet production for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in splenectomized (spleen removed) and non-splenectomized adults with chronic ITP, who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins or splenectomy.  In August 2008, Nplate® became the first FDA-approved peptibody protein, which works by raising and sustaining platelet counts representing a novel approach for the treatment of this chronic disease.  We are also evaluating romiplostim in pediatric ITP, myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”), and chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (“CIT”). Phase 2 studies in each setting were initiated in 2006. The trials are currently ongoing and we continue to evaluate the safety and efficacy of romiplostim in these settings.  Sensipar® (cinacalcet)  Cinacalcet (Sensipar®/Mimpara®) is an orally-administered small molecule that lowers parathyroid hormone (“PTH”) levels in blood by signaling through the calcium-sensing receptor (“CaR”) in parathyroid tissue to inhibit PTH secretion. It also lowers blood calcium and phosphorous levels.  The phase 3 EVOLVE (EValuation Of Cinacalcet Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events) trial, initiated in 2006, is a large (3,800 patient), multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind study to assess the effects of Sensipar® on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with CKD undergoing maintenance dialysis. The EVOLVE study completed enrollment in January 2008.  Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa)  Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp®) is a recombinant protein agonist of the erythropoietic receptor.  The Reduction of Events with Darbepoetin alfa in Heart Failure (“RED-HF™”) Trial phase 3 study, initiated in 2006, is a large (2,600 patient), global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of treatment of anemia with darbepoetin alfa on morbidity and mortality in patients with symptomatic left ventricular heart failure. The RED-HF™ Trial continues to enroll patients.  The Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp® Therapy (“TREAT”) phase 3 study, initiated in 2004, is a large (4,000 patient), multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to determine the impact of anemia therapy with darbepoetin alfa on mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients with CKD, anemia and type 2 diabetes. In December 2007, the TREAT study completed enrollment. In November 2008, we disclosed that the independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (“DSMC”) completed a pre-specified, unblinded review of the data at a point where 80% of the targeted number of fully adjudicated events had been recorded and recommended that the study continue without modification.  AMG 102  AMG 102 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks the action of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (“HGF/SF”). It is being investigated as a cancer treatment.  Phase 2 studies of single agent AMG 102 initiated in 2006 for renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) and glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”) are ongoing. An interim analysis of the GBM study was presented at ASCO 2008 in which AMG 102 was administered as a single agent to 40 patients with recurrent GBM to assess its safety and efficacy. We expect the final results from the phase 2 studies in RCC and GBM to be available in the first half of 2009. In 2008, data were presented at ASCO from a separate trial in which AMG 102 was combined with bevacizumab or motesanib. We also initiated in 2008, four separate phase 2 studies for the treatment of gastric, prostate, colorectal and small cell lung cancer.  AMG 108  AMG 108 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets inhibition of the action of interleukin-1 (“IL-1”).    26    Table of Contents In April 2008, we discussed results from the phase 2 study in RA. AMG 108 appeared to be well tolerated and showed a statistically significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of RA. However, the efficacy profile based on the results of this study was not comparable to the current standard of care for biologic therapies. Amgen is evaluating other options for the overall development program.  AMG 222  AMG 222 is an orally-administered small molecule antagonist of DPP-IV. It is being investigated as a treatment of type 2 diabetes. AMG 222 is being developed in partnership with Servier.  A phase 2a study is ongoing in this disease setting in collaboration with Servier. We expect the results from the phase 2a study to be available in the first half of 2009.  AMG 223  AMG 223 is an orally-administered polymer which binds phosphate. It is being investigated as a treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on hemodialysis.  The results for AMG 223 from its recently completed phase 1 study in normal healthy subjects and phase 2 study in subjects with CKD on hemodialysis with hyperphosphatemia have been obtained. AMG 223 appeared to be well tolerated and showed a statistically significant reduction in serum phosphorus compared with placebo. While these results were consistent with what is required for registration of a phosphate-binding therapy, in the context of our overall development portfolio, the Company will be reviewing other options for the commercialization of this investigational product.  AMG 317  AMG 317 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that is under investigation for its ability to block the actions of interleukin-4 (“IL-4”) and interleukin-13 (“IL-13”), cytokines that may play a role in asthma.  In 2008, a phase 2 dose ranging study in moderate to severe asthma was completed. An interim analysis showed evidence of biological activity; however, the overall clinical efficacy did not meet expectations. Complete study results will be presented in a peer-reviewed forum in 2009.  AMG 386  AMG 386 is a peptibody that binds to and inhibits angiopoietin 1 and 2. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment.  In 2007, we initiated four phase 2 studies of AMG 386 for the treatment of RCC, metastatic breast cancer, ovarian cancer and gastric cancer. We expect the results from the phase 2 gastric study to be available in the second half of 2009.  AMG 479  AMG 479 is a fully human monoclonal antibody antagonist of IGF-1 receptor. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment.  In 2007, we initiated a phase 2 study of AMG 479 as a potential cancer therapeutic in Ewing’s Sarcoma. We also initiated in 2008, phase 2 studies for the treatment of advanced breast, pancreatic, colorectal and small cell lung cancers.  AMG 655  AMG 655 is a fully human monoclonal antibody agonist that targets death receptor 5 (“DR5”) and induces apoptosis in sensitive tumor cells. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment.  Phase 2 studies in pancreatic cancer, NSCLC, colorectal cancer (“CRC”) and soft tissue sarcoma are ongoing. We expect the results from the phase 2 NSCLC and soft tissue sarcoma studies to be available in the second half of 2009.    27    Table of Contents Motesanib  Motesanib is an orally-administered small molecule antagonist of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3 (“VEGFR1-3”), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (“PDGFR”) and stem cell factor receptor (“c-kit”). It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. We are developing this product in collaboration with Takeda.  In 2008, we completed enrollment in phase 2 studies of motesanib versus bevacizumab in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and NSCLC and we expect the results from these studies to be available in the first half of 2009.  In November 2008, Amgen and Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company, a subsidiary of Takeda announced that enrollment in the phase 3 MONET1 trial evaluating motesanib in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC has been temporarily suspended following a planned safety data review of 600 patients by the study’s independent Data Monitoring Committee (“DMC”). The study’s DMC also recommended that patients with squamous NSCLC immediately discontinue motesanib therapy but did not recommend discontinuation of motesanib therapy for patients with non-squamous NSCLC. In February 2009, the DMC recommended the trial resume enrollment of patients with non-squamous NSCLC. Amgen, Millennium and Takeda plan to follow this recommendation, which will require modifications to the trial’s study design. Enrollment is expected to resume once these changes are sanctioned by appropriate global health authorities.  rhApo2L/TRAIL  rhApo2L/TRAIL is a recombinant human protein that targets death receptors 4 and 5 (“DR4 and DR5”) and induces apoptosis in sensitive tumor cells. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. We are developing this product in collaboration with Genentech.  Phase 2 studies in NSCLC and NHL are ongoing. We expect the results to be available in the second half of 2009.  Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials  Manufacturing  Our manufacturing operations consist of bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish and distribution activities for Aranesp®, Epoetin alfa, Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN® , ENBREL, Vectibix®, Nplate®, denosumab and other products and product candidates for both commercial and clinical purposes. Bulk manufacturing includes fermentation and cell culture, which are the processes in which our proteins are produced. The proteins are purified to a high quality and then formulated into a stable form. The fill process dispenses the formulated bulk protein into the vials or syringes. Finally, in the finish process, our products are packaged for distribution. We operate commercial and clinical manufacturing facilities in several locations throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands (see “Item 2. Properties”). Manufacturing of Sensipar®, our small molecule product, is performed entirely by third-party contractors.  We actively manage our inventory produced at our manufacturing facilities and supply produced by our third-party contract manufacturers. We expect to continue to use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of certain of our existing products and a number of our clinical product candidates.  (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We must continue to build the framework for our future growth, and if we fail to execute on our initiatives our business could be adversely affected.”)  In general, we have obtained licenses from various parties that we deem to be necessary or desirable for the manufacture of our products. These licenses generally require us to pay royalties to the parties on product sales.    28    Table of Contents Commercial Bulk Manufacturing  We operate commercial bulk manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and in several locations throughout the United States (see “Item 2. Properties”). Other than for ENBREL, we perform all of the commercial bulk manufacturing for our proteins.  In addition to commercial quantities of bulk ENBREL produced at our Rhode Island facility, we and Wyeth also have a contract manufacturing agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG (“BI Pharma”) for the production of additional supply of ENBREL. We also have a global supply agreement with Wyeth related to the manufacture, supply and allocation of bulk supplies of ENBREL. Under this agreement, we and Wyeth share the total worldwide bulk supply of ENBREL produced by our Rhode Island manufacturing facility, BI Pharma’s manufacturing facility in Germany and Wyeth’s manufacturing facility in Ireland.  Our supply of ENBREL is significantly dependent on product manufactured by BI Pharma, and, accordingly, we have made significant purchase commitments to BI Pharma. Under our supply agreements, BI Pharma has reserved a specified level of production capacity for ENBREL and we are committed to using at least that level of capacity. We are required to submit a rolling three-year forecast for manufacturing the bulk drug for ENBREL and a rolling forecast for a shorter period for the number of finished vials of ENBREL. We would be responsible for substantial payments to BI Pharma if we were not to use the minimum production capacity that BI Pharma has reserved for ENBREL each calendar year or if the BI Pharma supply agreement is terminated prematurely under specified conditions. (See Note 9, “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)  In addition to producing our own commercial quantities of Epoetin alfa, we also supply Epoetin alfa in the United States to J&J under a supply agreement (see “Joint Ventures and Business Relationships — Johnson & Johnson”).  Commercial Formulation, Fill and Finish Manufacturing  Our primary commercial formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facility is located in Puerto Rico. In addition, we operate a commercial formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facility in California for Vectibix® and conduct certain finish activities in the Netherlands (see “Item 2. Properties”). Other than for ENBREL and Nplate®, we perform substantially all of the commercial formulation, fill and finish activities for our proteins in Puerto Rico. In addition to the formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL performed by us in Puerto Rico or by BI Pharma for the ENBREL they manufacture and supply to us, fill and finish of a certain portion of ENBREL is also performed by other third-party contract manufacturers (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We manufacture and formulate, fill and finish substantially all our products at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at this facility, we may not be able to supply these products”).  Clinical Manufacturing  Clinical bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facilities are operated in several locations throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico (see “Item 2. Properties”). Certain finishing activities for our clinical products are performed in the Netherlands. In addition, we also utilize third-party contract manufacturers to perform manufacturing activities for certain of our clinical products.  Distribution  We operate distribution centers in Kentucky, California and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. In addition, we also use third party distributors to supplement distribution of our commercial and clinical products in certain areas of the world.  Other  In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, our operations in the United States and Puerto Rico perform key manufacturing support functions, including quality control, process development, procurement, distribution and production scheduling. Our global supply of our principal products is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities.    29    Table of Contents Manufacturing Initiatives  We have a number of key ongoing initiatives to assist in meeting our future manufacturing needs. In order to maintain supply, mitigate risks associated with the majority of our formulation, fill and finish operations being performed in a single facility and to adequately prepare to launch a number of our late-stage product candidates, in particular denosumab, we must successfully implement a number of manufacturing projects on schedule, operate our facilities at appropriate production capacity over the next few years, optimize manufacturing asset utilization, continue our use of third-party contract manufacturers and maintain a state of regulatory compliance. Key manufacturing projects include: (i) construction, qualification and licensure of a new formulation and filling facility at our Puerto Rico site and (ii) expansion and the related qualification and licensure of our existing bulk protein facilities at our Puerto Rico site for the production of our late-stage product candidate, denosumab. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales; timing of supply may also be affected by operation of our distribution and logistics centers and providers.”)  Raw Materials and Medical Devices  Certain raw materials, medical devices and components needed for manufacturing are proprietary products provided by single-source third-party suppliers. Certain of these raw materials, medical devices and components are cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from the specified sole source. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such sole-sourced suppliers by inventory management, relationship management and evaluating alternate sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers, their ability to supply our needs and the market conditions for these items.  Also, certain raw materials required for commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin (“HSA”). Some of our manufacturing processes currently use biological sources and we continue to investigate alternatives to biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of biologically-sourced raw materials as such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. Also, certain countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction of the use of biologically derived substances in the manufacture of our products could disrupt our commercial manufacturing of products, or could result in a mandated withdrawal of products from the market. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We rely on single third-party suppliers for some of our raw materials, medical devices and components; if these third-parties fail to supply these items, we may be unable to supply our products.”)  We perform various procedures to assist in authenticating the source of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products, which include verification of the country of origin. These procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes performed by us and our third-party contract manufacturers.  Joint Ventures and Business Relationships  From time to time, we may enter into joint ventures and other business relationships to provide additional development, manufacturing and marketing capabilities. In addition to our internal R&D efforts, we have acquired certain product rights and have established R&D collaborations to enhance our R&D capabilities and internally developed product pipeline. Our R&D collaborations generally provide for non-refundable, upfront license fees, R&D and commercial performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. Additionally, these collaborations may include manufacturing and co-promotion arrangements. Our collaboration agreements with third parties are performed on a “best efforts” basis with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success.  Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require parties to collaboration and licensing agreements to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of the collaboration or licensing arrangement with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or obtain access to our information.    30    Table of Contents Kirin Holdings Company, Limited  We formed KA, a 50-50 joint venture with Kirin in 1984. KA develops and commercializes certain of our and Kirin’s product rights, which have been transferred to this joint venture. KA has given exclusive licenses to us to manufacture and market: (i) darbepoetin alfa in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, (ii) pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in the United States and (iv) romiplostim in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain African and Middle East countries. We currently market darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, G-CSF, recombinant human erythropoietin and romiplostim under the brand names Aranesp®, Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN®/GRANULOKINE®, EPOGEN® and Nplate®, respectively.  KA has also given exclusive licenses to Kirin to manufacture and market: (i) darbepoetin alfa and romiplostim in Japan, the People’s Republic of China (“China”), Taiwan, Korea and certain other countries in Asia, (ii) pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in Japan, Taiwan and Korea and (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in Japan. Kirin markets darbepoetin alfa in Japan under the brand name NESP®. Kirin markets G-CSF and recombinant human erythropoietin in China under a separate agreement with KA. Kirin markets its G-CSF product in its respective territories under the trademark GRAN®. Kirin markets its recombinant human erythropoietin product in Japan under the trademark ESPO®.  KA has licensed to J&J rights to recombinant human erythropoietin in all geographic areas of the world outside the United States, China and Japan (see “— Johnson & Johnson”). Under its agreement with KA, J&J pays a royalty to KA based on sales. KA has also licensed to Roche rights to pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in certain geographic areas of the world.  In connection with our various license agreements with KA, we pay KA royalties based on product sales. In addition, we also receive payment from KA for conducting certain R&D activities on its behalf (see Note 4, “Related party transactions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  Johnson & Johnson  We granted J&J a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all markets other than dialysis. All recombinant human erythropoietin sold by J&J in the United States is manufactured by us and sold by J&J under the trademark PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa). PROCRIT® brand Epoetin alfa is identical to EPOGEN® brand Epoetin alfa, which is manufactured and sold by us in the U.S. dialysis market. Pursuant to the license agreement with J&J, we earn a 10% royalty on net sales of PROCRIT® by J&J in the United States.  Outside the United States, with the exception of China and Japan, J&J was granted rights to manufacture and commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic for all uses under a licensing agreement with KA. With respect to its sales outside of the United States, J&J manufactures and commercializes its own brand of Epoetin alfa which is then sold by J&J under various trademarks such as EPREX® and ERYPO®. We are not involved in the manufacture of Epoetin alfa sold by J&J outside of the United States.  Wyeth  Amgen and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL under a co-promotion agreement in the United States and Canada for all approved indications. The rights to market ENBREL outside of the United States and Canada are reserved to Wyeth. Under the co-promotion agreement, a management committee comprised of equal representation from Wyeth and Amgen is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL, including strategic planning, the approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing and the establishment of a brand team. The brand team, with equal representation from each party, prepares and implements the annual marketing plan, which requires a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party, and is     31    Table of Contents  responsible for all sales activities. Further, pursuant to the co-promotion agreement, Wyeth and Amgen each pay a defined percentage of all selling and marketing expenses approved by the management committee. In addition, we pay Wyeth a percentage of the annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales, which reflect the sharing of manufacturing costs in the United States and Canada attributable to all approved indications for ENBREL on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, we maintain a majority share of ENBREL profits. Under the co-promotion agreement, Wyeth is required to reimburse Amgen for: (i) certain clinical and regulatory expenses we incur in connection with the filing and approval of any new indications for ENBREL in the United States and Canada, (ii) certain specified patent expenses related to ENBREL and (iii) certain costs, expenses and liabilities associated with the manufacture, use or sale of ENBREL in the United States and Canada.  We also have a global supply agreement with Wyeth related to the manufacture, supply and allocation of bulk supplies of ENBREL. Under this agreement, we and Wyeth share the total worldwide bulk supply of ENBREL produced by our Rhode Island manufacturing facility, BI Pharma’s manufacturing facility in Germany and Wyeth’s manufacturing facility in Ireland.  Our agreements with Wyeth do not include a change of control provision.  Fresenius Medical Care North America, Inc.  In October 2006, we entered into a five-year sole sourcing and supply agreement with an affiliate of Fresenius Medical Care North America, Inc. (“Fresenius”), on its behalf and on behalf of certain of its affiliates, whereby they have agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to supply, all of Fresenius’ commercial requirements for ESAs for use in managing the anemia of its hemodialysis patients in the United States and Puerto Rico, based on forecasts provided by Fresenius and subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement.  Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited  In July 2007, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (“Daiichi Sankyo”), which provided them the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize denosumab in Japan in PMO and oncology with the potential for additional indications. As part of the agreement, Amgen received exclusive worldwide rights to certain Daiichi Sankyo intellectual property to the extent applicable to denosumab.  Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited  In February 2008, we entered into a license agreement with Takeda, which provided them the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize for the Japanese market up to 12 clinical stage molecules from our pipeline across a range of therapeutic areas, including oncology and inflammation. The molecules covered by the license agreement primarily include: AMG 108, AMG 317, AMG 386, AMG 479, AMG 655 and Vectibix®. We have the right to participate in the promotion of these products in Japan. In addition, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda for the worldwide development and commercialization of motesanib (AMG 706). Each party has the right to participate in the commercialization of motesanib in the other party’s territory. In connection with these agreements, Takeda acquired our subsidiary in Japan, Amgen K.K.  Government Regulation  Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing R&D activities.  In order to clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. In the United States, the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the FDAAA, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the raw materials and components used in the production of, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and distribution of our products on a product-by-product basis. The failure to comply with the applicable regulatory     32    Table of Contents  requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution.  Clinical Development. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves our expenditure of substantial resources, and any approval we obtain remains costly for us to maintain (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products or conduct other potentially limiting or costly risk management activities if we or others identify side effects or safety concerns after our products are on the market.”, “— Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.”, “— We may not be able to develop commercial products.” and “— If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.”). After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an investigational new drug (“IND”) application with the FDA to begin human testing. The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.  Typically, we undertake a three-phase human clinical testing program. In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects. In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side effect profiles and efficacy of our product candidates in a larger number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. The time and expense required for us to perform this clinical testing is substantial and may vary by product. For example, denosumab, one of our late-stage product candidates, requires large trials that require substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. Historically, our products have required smaller, shorter trials. Foreign studies performed under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to U.S. studies. The FDA will accept a foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND only if the study is well-designed, well-conducted, performed by qualified investigators, and conforms to the ethical principles contained in the Declaration of Helsinki (as embodied in FDA regulations) and applicable laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted. Phase 1, 2 and 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We may not be able to develop commercial products.”) The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s risk/benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.”)  Applications. The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA for biologic products subject to the Public Health Service Act or a new drug application (“NDA”) for drugs subject to the approval provisions of the FDCA. The submission of the application is no guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. If an application is accepted for filing, following the FDA’s review, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require postmarketing clinical trials or other studies to confirm the product’s safety and efficacy for its intended use. We cannot take any action to market any new drug or biologic product in the United States until our appropriate marketing application has been approved by the FDA.  Post-approval Phase. Under the FDAAA, if the FDA becomes aware of new safety information after approval of a product, they may require us to conduct further clinical trials to assess a known or potential serious     33    Table of Contents  risk. If required to conduct a post-approval study, periodic status reports must be submitted to the FDA. Failure to conduct such post-approval studies in a timely manner may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties.  The FDAAA also gave the FDA authority to require companies to implement a REMS for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. The FDA may require the submission of a REMS before a product is approved, or after approval based on new safety information, including new analyses of existing safety information. A REMS may include a medication guide, patient package insert, a plan for communication with healthcare providers, or other elements as the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the product, which could include imposing certain restrictions on distribution or use of a product. A REMS must include a timetable for submission of assessments of the strategy at specified time intervals. Failure to comply with a REMS, including the submission of a required assessment or any modification to a REMS, may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties.  Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval also can result in additional limitations being placed on a product’s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA has authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a product’s lifecycle based on new safety information. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Recent labeling changes or risk mitigation activities required by regulatory authorities, as well as the results or meta-analyses of clinical trials, may adversely impact the use, sales and reimbursement of our ESAs.”) Failure to implement FDA-mandated changes may result in civil or criminal penalties. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products or conduct other potentially limiting or costly risk management activities if we or others identify side effects or safety concerns after our products are on the market.”)  FDA Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. The FDA closely reviews and regulates the marketing and promotion of products. We are required to gain FDA approval before marketing or promoting a product as a treatment for a particular indication. Our product advertising and promotion for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations and standards. The FDA’s review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA also reviews industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product (“off-label promotion”) or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDA regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by Congress or other legislators.  FDA Regulation of Manufacturing Standards. The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market a product. If after receiving clearance from the FDA, we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that our equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations.  Approval and Post-Approval Regulation Ex-US. In the EU countries, Switzerland, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. Additionally, depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval in the EU, including a centralized procedure. The specific requirements of each track differ depending upon the type of drug being reviewed. In the centralized procedure, a company submits a single     34    Table of Contents  marketing authorization application to the EMEA who conducts a thorough evaluation, drawing from its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the European Commission for final approval of the marketing authorization. While the Commission generally follows the CHMP’s opinion, it is not bound to do so. Although not all medicines have to undergo the centralized procedure, it is required of products derived from biotechnology. After evaluation and marketing authorization, various parties, including the national competent authorities, the EMEA, the European Commission and the marketing authorization holders share responsibilities for the detection, assessment and prevention of adverse effects and other medicine-related problems in a process known as pharmacovigilance. Healthcare professionals and patients are also encouraged to report adverse effects and other medicine-related problems. This process includes the collection of adverse drug reaction reports as part of the follow-up on any side effects of a product, and upon assessment, the authorities can decide to demand that the product labels be updated with safety data or warnings, that safety data or warnings be provided to healthcare professionals, or recommend the temporary suspension or complete withdrawal of a product from the market.  Other. We are also subject to various federal and state laws, as well as foreign laws, pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. The federal government has published regulations that identify “safe harbors” or exemptions for certain arrangements that do not violate the anti-kickback statute. We seek to comply with the safe harbors wherever possible. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). If the government were to allege against or convict us of violating these laws, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, including our stock price. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities.  Since 1991, we have participated in the Medicaid rebate program established in Section 1927 of the Social Security Act by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and subsequent amendments of that law. Related to our participation in this program is a requirement that we extend comparable discounts under the Public Health Service (“PHS”) pharmaceutical pricing program. Under the Medicaid rebate program, we pay a rebate for each unit of our product reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the rebate for each of our products is set by law as a minimum 15.1% of the Average Manufacturer Price (“AMP”) of that product, or if it is greater, the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any non-exempt customer. The rebate amount also includes an inflation adjustment if AMP increases faster than inflation. The PHS pricing program requires that we extend discounts comparable to the Medicaid rebate to a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The rebate amount is determined for each quarter based on our reports of the quarter’s AMP and best price for each of our products to the CMS. The terms of our participation in the program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if we were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information. Under the Medicare program our products are reimbursed under a Medicare Part B payment methodology that reimburses each product at a specified percentage of its ASP (sometimes referred to as “ASP+6%”). ASP is calculated by the manufacturer     35    Table of Contents  based on a statutorily defined formula and submitted to CMS and similar civil monetary penalties apply for knowingly submitting false information. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, and to the extent access to and reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”)  We also make our products available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) of the General Services Administration. Since 1993, as a result of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (the “VHC Act”), federal law has required that we offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard and the PHS (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement of our products under the Medicaid program or purchase of our products by these four federal agencies and certain federal grantees. FSS pricing to these four federal agencies must be equal to or less than the Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”), which is 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“Non-FAMP”) for the prior fiscal year. The accuracy of our reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs and our FSS contract prices may be audited by the government under applicable federal procurement laws and the terms of our FSS contract. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies in calculation of Non-FAMPs and FCPs is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified Federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. Also, if we were found to have knowingly reported a false Non-FAMP, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the VHC Act provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per item that is incorrect. Finally, we are required to disclose in our FSS contract proposal all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than our proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, we are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions.  We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other current and potential future federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations. Our R&D activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. We believe that our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. While we are not required to do so, we strive to conduct our research and manufacturing activities in a manner that meets the intents and purposes of the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research.  Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA would include interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations.  (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products or conduct other potentially limiting or costly risk management activities if we or others identify side effects or safety concerns after our products are on the market.” and “— Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, and to the extent that access to and reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”)  Human Resources  As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 16,900 staff members, which include approximately 200 part-time staff members. Of the total staff members as of December 31, 2008, approximately 7,850 were engaged in R&D, approximately 3,050 were engaged in selling and marketing, approximately 3,600 were engaged in commercial manufacturing activities and approximately 2,400 were engaged in other activities. There can be no     36    Table of Contents  assurance that we will be able to continue attracting and retaining qualified personnel in sufficient numbers to meet our needs. None of our staff members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our staff relations to be good.  Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require our staff members, material consultants and scientific advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or the consulting relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or obtain access to our information.

RISK FACTORS  This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, operations, liquidity and stock price materially and adversely.    38    Table of Contents Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products or conduct other potentially limiting or costly risk management activities if we or others identify side effects or safety concerns after our products are on the market.  We and certain of our licensees and partners conduct research, preclinical testing and clinical trials for our product candidates and marketed products for both their existing indications as well as for new and/or expanded indications. In addition, we manufacture and contract manufacture, and certain of our licensees and partners manufacture our products and product candidates, price, sell, distribute and market or co-market our products for their approved indications. These activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, such as the FDA and CMS, as well as in foreign countries, such as the EMEA in European countries and similar regulatory bodies in Canada and Australia. Currently, we are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from those countries’ regulatory authorities before we can manufacture (or have our third-party manufacturers produce), market and sell our products in those countries. The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to fail to approve commencement of, suspend or terminate clinical trials, require additional testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval, mandate product withdrawals and require changes in labeling (including eliminating certain therapeutic indications) of our products. In 2007, the FDAAA was signed into law significantly adding to the FDA’s authority including allowing the FDA to (i) require sponsors of marketed products to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk; (ii) mandate labeling changes to products, at any point in a product’s lifecycle, based on new safety information and (iii) require sponsors to implement a REMS for a product which could include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to healthcare providers, or other elements as the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the drug, which could include imposing certain restrictions on distribution or use of a product. Failure to comply with the new requirements, if imposed on a sponsor by the FDA under the FDAAA, could result in significant civil monetary penalties. Further, regulatory agencies could change existing, or promulgate new, regulations at any time which may affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our existing or future products or require significant additional costs to obtain or maintain such approvals.  In our experience, obtaining regulatory approval has been and continues to be increasingly difficult and costly and takes many years, and, after it is obtained, is increasingly costly to maintain. With the occurrence of a number of high profile safety events relating to certain pharmaceutical products, regulatory authorities, and, in particular, the FDA, members of Congress, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (“GAO”), Congressional committees, private health/science foundations and organizations, medical professionals, including physicians and investigators, and the general public are increasingly concerned about potential or perceived safety issues associated with pharmaceutical and biological products, whether under study for initial approval or already marketed. For example, we have received letters from both the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation, Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States Senate Committee on Finance with inquiries with respect to our ESA studies, promotion of our ESAs and other products, our rebates and contracting strategies and our pharmacovigilance program, to which we have fully cooperated by submitting our responses and meeting with Congressional staff. To the extent that there is resulting legislation or changes in CMS or FDA policy or regulatory activity as a result of Congressional concerns, such changes could have a material adverse effect on the use of our ESA products that are the subject of such changes.  As a result of this increasing concern, potential or perceived safety signals and safety concerns, from clinical trials, use by the market or other sources, are receiving greater scrutiny, which may lead to (i) fewer treatments being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies, (ii) revised labeling of an approved product or a class of products for safety reasons, potentially including a boxed warning or additional limitations on the use of approved products in specific therapeutic areas (possibly until additional clinical trials can be designed and completed), (iii) mandated PMCs or pharmacovigilance programs for approved products and/or (iv) requirement of risk management activities (including a REMS) related to the promotion and sale of a product. In addition, significant concerns about the safety and effectiveness of our products could ultimately lead to the revocation of     39    Table of Contents  marketing approval of the products within particular therapeutic areas, or in total, which would have a material adverse effect on the use, sales and reimbursement of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. (See “— Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, and to the extent that access to and reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”)  Certain specific labeling or label changes of our approved products or product candidates may be necessary or required for a number of reasons, including: the identification of actual or theoretical safety or efficacy concerns concerning any of our products by regulatory agencies, the discovery of significant problems or safety signals or trends with a similar product that implicates an entire class of products, subsequent concerns about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying the label or changes to the underlying safety/efficacy analysis related to results from clinical trials or meta-analysis of clinical trials or clinical data performed by us or others. Label changes may also be required as a result of new legislation. Under new FDA legislation implemented in 2006, the Physician’s Labeling Rule (“PLR”) requires changes to the existing format of U.S. product package inserts for human prescription drug and biological products with the intent of making product information more easily accessible. The PLR requires revised standards of content and format of labeling and provides timelines for when new and previously approved products must comply with the new regulations. In addition, before or after any of our products are approved for commercial use, regulatory bodies could decide that the product labels need to include certain warning language as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products. For example, in March and November 2007, and in March and August 2008, the U.S. labels for the class of ESA products, including Aranesp® and EPOGEN® , were updated to include revised boxed warnings, restrictions on the use of ESAs in specific therapeutic areas and other safety-related product labeling changes. (See “— Recent labeling changes or risk management activities required by regulatory authorities, as well as the results or meta-analyses of clinical trials, may adversely impact the use, sales and reimbursement of our ESAs.”) On March 17, 2008, we and Wyeth announced updates to the FDA-approved labeling for ENBREL in which the U.S. PI now contains a boxed warning relating to the risk of infections, including tuberculosis. This information in the boxed warning includes additional language regarding screening and monitoring patients for tuberculosis, including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection. Further, on September 4, 2008, the FDA issued a web-alert regarding their review of histoplasmosis and other opportunistic fungal infections in patients treated with TNF-blockers. The FDA requested that the boxed warning and WARNINGS sections of the U.S. PI and the medication guide for ENBREL (and other TNF-blockers) be strengthened to include the risk of unrecognized histoplasmosis and other invasive fungal infections with the goal of increasing timely diagnosis and treatment. The FDA also requested that the approved REMS for ENBREL be modified with a communication plan to healthcare providers regarding the risk of unrecognized fungal infections. In December 2008, we agreed with the FDA on the required revisions to the U.S. PI, and we continue to work with the FDA to finalize the requested updates to the ENBREL REMS.  Additionally, on June 4, 2008, the FDA issued an Early Communication regarding the ongoing safety review of TNF-blockers and the possible association between the use of these medicines and the development of lymphoma and other cancers in children and young adults and stated that it had decided to conduct further analyses to evaluate the risk and benefits of TNF-blockers in pediatric patients. On June 18, 2008, we participated in a meeting of the DODAC to review data supporting the supplemental BLA submitted by us for the use of ENBREL in treating pediatric patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, who are inadequately controlled with topical therapy or who have received systemic therapy or phototherapy and the DODAC recommended, with an 8-5 vote, to approve ENBREL in the treatment of chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in children. On July 24, 2008, we received notification from the FDA through a complete response letter that the FDA would like additional information from us regarding the use of ENBREL in pediatric patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. We cannot predict what the result of the FDA’s analysis of TNF-blockers and the development of lymphoma or other cancers in children and young adults may be, nor can we speculate on the effect of that analysis on the supplemental BLA. However, further revisions to the ENBREL label or other actions by the FDA, including additional advisory committee meetings, could have a material adverse impact on the use and sales of ENBREL which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.    40    Table of Contents A revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above could be required even if there is no clearly established connection between the product and the safety or efficacy concerns that have been raised or if the product is not indicated for a particular use. For example, in October 2007 we announced that we and the FDA adopted changes to the U.S. labeling for Vectibix® based on the results of the Panitumumab Advanced Colorectal Cancer Evaluation (“PACCE”) trial highlighting to clinicians the greater risk seen when Vectibix® is combined with Avastin® and the specific chemotherapy used in the PACCE trial to treat patients with first-line mCRC. Vectibix® is not indicated for the first-line treatment of mCRC and the additional safety information applies to an unapproved use of Vectibix®.  If we or others identify safety concerns before approval of the product or after a product is on the market, the regulatory agencies such as the FDA or EMEA may impose risk management activities upon us (including a REMS) which may require substantial costs and resources to negotiate, develop and implement, including sales force time to educate physicians on REMS requirements and compliance, and/or may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a pharmacovigilance program of our product or for approval of a new indication. Further, risk management activities, including a REMS, required by regulatory agencies such as the FDA could also modify, restrict or otherwise impact the ability of healthcare providers to prescribe, dispense or use our products, limit patient access to our products or affect our ability to compete against products that do not have a REMS, any of which could have a negative effect on our ability to launch our affected products and could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. For example, as part of the approval for Nplate®, a REMS was developed with the FDA to assure the safe use of Nplate® while minimizing risk. The Nplate®  REMS involves, among other things, healthcare provider and patient enrollment registries, tracking of patient medical history and data and follow-up safety questionnaires to healthcare providers, all of which require extensive discussion with and education of healthcare providers which has limited our ability to promote Nplate®. Further, as part of the update to the boxed warning and warnings sections of the U.S. PI and the medication guide for ENBREL, the FDA stated that it would require us and the other makers of TNF-blockers to educate healthcare providers about the risk of unrecognized histoplasmosis. Our efforts to comply with the requirements of our existing REMS and any additional REMS or other risk management activities required of us in the future could restrict or otherwise impact our existing promotional activities for our other products as well. In addition, we have ongoing PMC studies for all of our marketed products. These clinical trials must be conducted by us to maintain regulatory approval and marketing authorization. For example, we have agreed with the FDA to a robust pharmacovigilance program to continue to study the safety surrounding the use of ESAs in the oncology setting. (See “— Recent labeling changes or risk management activities required by regulatory authorities, as well as the results or meta-analyses of clinical trials, may adversely impact the use, sales and reimbursement of our ESAs.”) Additionally, the original approvals of Vectibix® in both the United States and EU were conditioned on us conducting additional clinical trials of the use of Vectibix® as a therapy in treating mCRC. Our conditional approval of Vectibix® in the EU is reviewed annually by the CHMP, and in December 2008 we agreed as a condition of the renewal of the conditional approval to conduct an additional clinical trial in the existing approved indication. If results from clinical trials as part of a PMC or pharmacovigilance program are negative, it could result in the revocation of the marketing or conditional marketing approvals or revised labeling of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations.  Substantially all of our marketed products are currently approved in the United States and most are approved in Europe and in other foreign countries for specific uses. However, later discovery of unknown problems with our products could result in the regulatory activities described above or even the potential withdrawal of the product in certain therapeutic areas or certain product presentations, or completely, from the market. If new medical data suggest an unacceptable safety risk or previously unidentified side-effects, we may voluntarily withdraw, or regulatory authorities may mandate we withdraw, such product in certain therapeutic areas, or completely recall a product presentation from the market for some period or permanently. For example in 2006, we initiated a voluntary recall of the Neulasta® SureClick™ pre-filled pen in Europe because of the potential risk to patients of receiving an incomplete dose and we conducted a voluntary wholesaler recall of a limited number of lots of ENBREL as a result of a small number of reports of missing, detached or loose rubber caps on the needleless syringe filled with diluent liquid by a third-party contract manufacturer and packaged with the vials of     41    Table of Contents  ENBREL. In addition in August 2008, we voluntary recalled two manufacturing lots of EPOGEN® and our licensee, Ortho Biotech, voluntarily recalled one manufacturing lot of PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa) that was manufactured in our manufacturing facilities after having identified cracks in the necks of a small number of vials upon post-manufacturing inspection. Although there have been no observable adverse event trends associated with the Neulasta® SureClick™ pre-filled pen, with the reports of missing, detached or loose rubber caps on the needleless syringe packaged with the ENBREL vials or with the cracks in the neck of vials of Epoetin alfa, we may experience the same or other problems in the future resulting in broader product recalls or adverse event trends. Additionally, if other parties (including our licensees, such as J&J and Wyeth, or independent investigators) report or fail to effectively report to regulatory agencies side effects or other safety concerns that occur from their use of our products in clinical trials or studies or from marketed use, regulatory approval may be withdrawn for a product for the therapeutic area in question, or completely, or other risk management activities may be required by regulators.  If regulatory authorities determine that we or our licensees or partners conducting R&D activities on our behalf have not complied with regulations in the R&D of a product candidate, new indication for an existing product or information to support a current indication, then they may not approve the product candidate or new indication or maintain approval of the current indication in its current form or at all, and we will not be able to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, safety signals, trends, adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators) from the marketed use of our drugs that result in revised safety-related labeling or restrictions on the use of our approved products could negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our products, regulatory or private health organization medical guidelines and reimbursement for our products all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. (See “— Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, and to the extent that access to and reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.” and “— Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.”)  Recent labeling changes or risk management activities required by regulatory authorities, as well as the results or meta-analyses of clinical trials, may adversely impact the use, sales and reimbursement of our ESAs.  On March 9, 2007, based upon data from our AoC 103 Study, J&J’s Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency (“CHOIR”) study, and preliminary data from the third-party investigator DAHANCA 10 Study, among others, the FDA approved updated safety information, including a boxed warning, in the labeling for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp® and EPOGEN®. On May 10, 2007, the ODAC held a panel meeting to discuss the safety/efficacy profile of ESA use in oncology. Responding to questions posed by the FDA, the ODAC recommended that more restrictions be added to ESA labeling and that additional clinical trials be conducted by companies with currently approved ESAs, including us, although no specific restrictions or studies were recommended at the ODAC meeting. The committee is advisory and FDA officials are not bound to or limited by its recommendations, although the FDA has commonly followed the recommendations of its advisory panels. The FDA also held a joint meeting of the CRDAC and the DSaRMAC on September 11, 2007, which evaluated the safety data on ESA use in renal disease. On November 8, 2007, in recognition of the input from the May 2007 ODAC and September 2007 joint CRDAC/DSaRMAC meetings, we announced additional updates to the Aranesp® and EPOGEN®/PROCRIT® labeling which reflected ongoing interactions with the FDA regarding the safety and benefit/risk profile of ESAs and included modifications to the boxed warnings of the ESA labeling. Additionally, based on safety data from the Preoperative Epirubicin Paclitaxel Aranesp® (“PREPARE”) interim study results in neo-adjuvant breast cancer and the data from the Gynecologic Oncology Group 191 (“GOG-191”) study in cervical cancer, on March 7, 2008, we announced that the FDA approved updated safety information, including the boxed warning in the labeling information for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp® and EPOGEN®. On March 13, 2008, the FDA held a follow-up ODAC panel meeting to discuss cumulative data, including recent study results, on the risks of ESAs when used in the oncology setting.    42    Table of Contents On July 30, 2008, we received a complete response letter from the FDA to the revisions to the ESA labeling we proposed following the March 13, 2008 ODAC meeting. The letter included, among other things, (i) the addition to the boxed warning of a statement that ESAs are not indicated for patients receiving myelosuppressive therapy when the anticipated outcome of such therapy is cure, (ii) the addition of a statement in the DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION section of the label that ESA therapy should not be initiated at Hb levels ³ 10 g/dL and that dose should be adjusted to maintain the lowest Hb level sufficient to avoid red blood cell transfusions and (iii) the removal of reference to the upper safety limit of 12 g/dL. We revised the ESA labeling on August 6, 2008, as the FDA directed, and have experienced a reduction in our ESA sales, in particular Aranesp® sales in the U.S. supportive cancer care setting, since that time. Although we cannot predict what further impact the revised ESA labels may have on our business, the revised ESA labeling or any future labeling changes, including any required in connection with our ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding the conversion of the format of our ESA U.S. labels in accordance with the PLR, could have a material adverse impact on the reimbursement, use and sales of our ESA products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Additionally, we continue to work closely with the FDA to develop a REMS program for the class of ESA products under authority prescribed by the FDAAA. We have submitted a proposed REMS in response to the FDA’s requests, although we cannot predict what risk management activities the FDA may require of us, and the components of the REMS could be different for the use of ESAs in the oncology and nephrology indications. A REMS program for our ESA products could have a material adverse impact on the reimbursement, use and sales of our ESA products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. (See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products or conduct other potentially limiting or costly risk management activities if we or others identify side effects or safety concerns after our products are on the market” and “— Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, and to the extent that access to and reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”) We also continue to work with the FDA to finalize a new protocol for a clinical trial to determine the effects of ESAs on survival and tumor outcomes in anemic patients with metastatic cancer receiving concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy. We have submitted an Aranesp® study protocol to the FDA and plan to initiate the study in 2009. The addition of these clinical trials to our pharmacovigilance program and any additional clinical trials required by the FDA could result in substantial additional expense, and their outcomes could result in additional label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our ESA products. (See “— Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.”)  Further on March 5, 2008, we announced that the European Commission reached its decision to amend the product labeling for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp®, based on the positive opinion from the CHMP in January 2008, which was consistent with the EMEA’s October 23, 2007 press release stipulating a uniform target Hb range for all ESAs of 10 g/dL to 12 g/dL with guidance to avoid sustained Hb levels above 12 g/dL. Following the March 13, 2008 ODAC, we have continued to share additional ESA safety data with the EMEA as it has become available. On May 15, 2008, we and other ESA marketing authorization holders participated in a closed meeting of the SAG-O. The marketing authorization holders were asked to provide an overview on studies that have been initiated or conducted since July 2007, as well as any other new data that can help to elucidate recent issues on the impact of ESAs on tumor progression and survival in cancer patients. These data included previously disclosed interim results from the PREPARE study in neo-adjuvant breast cancer therapy; follow-up data from the GOG-191 study in cervical cancer, which were published in the February 2008 issue of Gynecologic Oncology; and the February 2008 meta-analysis by Bennett et al, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Scientific Advisory Groups (“SAGs”) are established by the EMEA to deliver answers, on a consultative basis, to specific questions addressed to them by the CHMP. On June 26, 2008 the     43    Table of Contents  EMEA, based upon the CHMP’s opinion which took into account the position expressed by the SAG-O, recommended updating the product information for ESAs with a new warning for their use in cancer patients. In July 2008, the EMEA requested that further clarity around the product information be provided by regulatory agencies in each European Member State country through the publication of a Dear Healthcare Professional Communication, following which we followed the necessary regulatory procedure to update the Aranesp® product information. In October 2008, we received notification that the Aranesp® product information update was approved by the European Commission. The product information for all ESAs was updated to advise that in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anemia in patients with cancer and that the decision to administer ESAs should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should take into account the specific clinical context and that factors that should be considered in the assessment should include the type of tumor and its stage, the degree of anemia, life-expectancy, the environment in which the patient is being treated and patient preference. Although we cannot predict what impact the final EU ESA product information will have on our business, the reimbursement, use and sales of Aranesp®  in Europe could be materially adversely affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Further, we continue to receive results from meta-analyses or previously initiated clinical trials using ESAs. For example, on September 30, 2008, we announced that we had received a summary of preliminary results from the Cochrane Collaboration’s independent meta-analysis of patient-level data from previously conducted, randomized, controlled, clinical studies evaluating ESAs in cancer patients which we submitted to the FDA and the EMEA. These results were also presented by the Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group in December at the 2008 ASH Congress. This Cochrane meta-analysis of patient level data from previous studies corroborates prior analyses indicating that the use of ESAs may increase the risk of death in cancer patients. The studies in the analysis all predate the current label, which advises using the least amount of ESA necessary to avoid transfusion. The analyses on all cancer patients were based on 53 previously conducted studies involving 13,933 patients. None of these studies utilized ESAs according to current label guidance. The overall survival results corroborate an earlier review by the Cochrane Collaboration, published in 2006, which is included in the WARNINGS section of the current U.S. PI (HR: 1.08 [95% CI 0.99-1.18]). The ESA treatment arm had increased on-study deaths (HR: 1.17 [95% CI 1.06-1.30]) and decreased overall survival (HR: 1.06 [95% CI 1.00-1.12]) compared to controls. The analyses on patients undergoing chemotherapy, the cancer indication for which ESAs are approved, were based on 38 studies with 10,441 patients. None of these studies utilized ESAs according to current label guidance. The ESA treatment arm had increased on-study deaths (HR: 1.10 [95% CI 0.98-1.24]) and decreased overall survival (HR: 1.04 [95% CI 0.97-1.11]) compared to controls. While neither of these results is statistically significant, they do not exclude the potential for adverse outcomes when ESAs are prescribed according to the current label. The final report on these endpoints is expected in 2009. Additionally, our TREAT study, a large 4,000 patient multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled phase 3 trial designed to determine the impact of anemia therapy with Aranesp® on mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients with CKD, anemia and type 2 diabetes, continues to progress. Although we cannot predict the results of meta-analyses or the outcomes of ongoing clinical trials, or the extent to which regulatory authorities may require additional labeling changes as a result of these or other trials, we cannot exclude the possibility that adverse results could have a material adverse impact on the reimbursement, use and sales of our ESAs which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.  Before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials which demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans for the indications sought or our existing products are safe and effective for use in humans in new indications sought. Additionally, we may be required to conduct additional trials as a condition of the approval of our label or as a result of perceived or existing safety concerns. The results of these clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain regulatory approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA. Clinical trials are experiments conducted using our products or product candidates in human patients hav-    44    Table of Contents  ing the diseases or medical conditions we are trying to address. Conducting clinical trials is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims we are seeking or to support our existing label. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product candidate or the extent of the safety concerns, post-marketing issues and/or exposure to patients and therefore, we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain trials. Our ability to complete our clinical trials in a timely fashion depends in large part on a number of key factors including protocol design, regulatory and institutional review board approval, availability of clinical study material and the rate of patient enrollment in clinical trials. Patient enrollment is a function of several factors, including the size and location of the patient population, enrollment criteria and competition with other clinical trials for eligible patients. As such, there may be limited availability of patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. Delays in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, delays in regulatory approvals, associated delays in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels. In addition, in order to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, India, East Asia and some Central and South American countries either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to identify and understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and regulatory aspects of our large, complex and regulatory diverse clinical trials, our clinical trials and corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates altogether or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our product candidates or are unable to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Additional information on our clinical trials can be found on our website at (http://www.amgen.com). (This website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing.)  Patients may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects in the course of our, our licensees, partners or independent investigator’s clinical trials of our products or product candidates that may delay the clinical program, require additional or longer trials to gain approval, prohibit regulatory approval of our product candidates or additional indications for our currently approved products, or may render the product candidate commercially unfeasible or limit our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or at all. For example, as a result of observing an increased frequency of cholecystitis (inflammation of the gall bladder) in patients treated with our late-stage product candidate motesanib, we delayed our phase 3 trial in first-line NSCLC, which was previously expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2006, until the second half of 2007. Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In these diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on an out of date standard of medical care, limiting the utility and application of such trials. Of course, even if we successfully manage our clinical trials, we may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates, product label extensions or maintenance of our current labels on this basis. Further, clinical trials conducted by others, including our licensees, partners or independent investigators, may result in unfavorable clinical trials results that may call into question the safety of our products in off-label or on label uses that may result in label restrictions and/or additional trials.  In connection with our efforts to improve our cost structure, we refocused our spending on critical R&D and operational priorities and sought greater efficiencies in how we conduct our business, including optimizing ongoing clinical trials and trial initiation. To the extent future sales are negatively affected as a result of additional regulatory and reimbursement developments or other challenges, we may be required to further adjust our R&D investment plans. Such actions could result in delays in obtaining approval or reductions in the number of indications and market potential of our product candidates.    45    Table of Contents Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, and to the extent that access to and reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.  Sales of all of our principal products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, including governments and private insurance plans. Generally, in Europe and other countries outside the United States, the government-sponsored healthcare system is the primary payor of healthcare costs of patients. Governments may regulate access to, prices or reimbursement levels of our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products. Worldwide use of our products may be affected by these cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers or patients in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce or reallocate healthcare expenditures. It is possible that applicable statutes, such as the MMA, could be modified or new legislation or regulation introduced in 2009 and later that could include a focus on reducing drug costs and change coverage and reimbursement methodologies for government healthcare programs that could have a significant impact on our business. Although we cannot predict when legislation or regulation affecting reimbursement from third-party payors may be proposed or enacted in the future or the specific effect any such legislation or regulation would have on our business, any such legislation or regulations changing and/or reducing the coverage and reimbursement of our products or the way our products are used or prescribed may cause our sales to decrease and our revenues to decline.  Further, adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others or from the marketed use of our drugs may expand the safety information in the labeling for our approved products and may negatively impact worldwide reimbursement for our products. For example, on January 14, 2008, CMS issued changes to its Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual that resulted in the reduced use of ESAs in clinical practice. A more detailed discussion of the Decision Memorandum follows below. (See also “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products or conduct other potentially limiting or costly risk management activities if we or others identify side effects or safety concerns after our products are on the market.” and “— Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.”)  An increasing focus on cost containment by public and private insurers has resulted, and could result in the future, in lower reimbursement rates for our products. Most patients receiving Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® for approved indications are covered by government and/or private payor healthcare programs. Medicare and Medicaid government healthcare programs’ payment policies for drugs and biologicals are subject to various laws and regulations. Effective January 1, 2009 in the hospital outpatient setting, our products are reimbursed under a Medicare Part B payment methodology that reimburses each product at 104% of its ASP (sometimes referred to as “ASP+4%”). The rate of reimbursement in the hospital outpatient setting has been reduced twice since its inception (with reimbursement rates set at ASP+5% for 2008 and ASP+6% from 2005 to 2007). Effective January 1, 2009, in the physician office setting, Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® are reimbursed under a Medicare Part B payment methodology that reimburses each product at ASP+6%. CMS has the regulatory authority to alter or maintain the Medicare payment rates for Part B drugs and biologicals in the future for the hospital outpatient setting. A product’s ASP is calculated and reported to CMS on a quarterly basis and may change each quarter. The ASP in effect for a given quarter (the “Current Period”) is based upon certain historical sales and sales incentive data covering a statutorily defined period of time preceding the Current Period. For example, the ASP based payment rate for Aranesp®  that will be in effect for the second quarter of 2009 will be based in part on certain historical sales and sales incentive data for Aranesp® from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008.  In the dialysis setting, our products may also be subject to downward pressure on reimbursement rates. In the United States, dialysis providers are primarily reimbursed for EPOGEN® by the federal government through the ESRD Program of Medicare. The ESRD Program reimburses approved providers for 80% of allowed dialysis costs; the remainder is paid by other sources, including patients, state Medicaid programs, private insurance, and to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. The ESRD Program reimbursement methodology is established by federal law and is monitored and implemented by CMS. Currently, the payment mechanism for separately reimbursed dialysis drugs in both free-standing and hospital-based dialysis centers, including EPOGEN® and     46    Table of Contents  Aranesp®, is reimbursed by Medicare at ASP+6%. Although we cannot predict the payment levels of EPOGEN® in future quarters or the extent to which Medicare payments for dialysis drugs may be modified by future federal regulation or legislation, a decrease in the reimbursement rate for EPOGEN® may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Any changes to the ASP calculations directly affect the Medicare reimbursement for our products administered in the physician clinic setting, dialysis facility and hospital outpatient setting. These calculations are regularly reviewed for completeness and based on such review, and we have revised our reported ASPs to reflect calculation changes both prospectively and retroactively. For example, partially as a result of our methodology changes, our ASP reimbursement rate for EPOGEN® was reduced for the third quarter of 2007.  Since April 1, 2006, the Medicare reimbursement for ESAs administered to dialysis patients has been subject to a revised EMP, the Medicare payment review mechanism used by CMS to monitor EPOGEN® and Aranesp®  utilization and appropriate hematocrit outcomes of dialysis patients. The EMP was revised, effective January 1, 2008, requiring a 50% reduction in Medicare reimbursement if a patient’s Hb is above 13 g/dL for three or more consecutive months. In addition, the revised EMP reduces the monthly dosing limits to 400,000 IUs of EPOGEN®, from 500,000 IUs, and to 1,200 mcgs of Aranesp®, from 1,500 mcgs. The implementation of the revised EMP and ESA labeling changes led to a decline in EPOGEN® sales for the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007 primarily due to a decline in both overall utilization and as well as average dosing per patient. While this dose decline subsequently stabilized in 2008, it may further fluctuate in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on sales of EPOGEN® and our business and results of operations.  On July 15, 2008, the MIPPA became law with a number of Medicare and Medicaid reforms including a broader payment bundle for dialysis services and drugs which will require CMS, beginning in 2011, to establish a bundled Medicare payment rate that includes dialysis services and drug/labs that are currently separately billed. The new bundled rate will include dialysis services covered under the current composite rate, as well as all injectable drugs commonly provided during dialysis treatment, and currently billed separately, including ESAs, IV iron, and IV vitamin D, as well as “oral equivalent” forms of these IV drugs. The bundled reimbursement rate will be phased in over a four year period in equal increments starting in 2011. It is possible that some providers could elect to move to a full Medicare bundled payment in 2011. CMS will also be required to establish a quality incentive program that begins concurrently with bundling in 2011 and which subjects facilities to up to a 2% annual reduction in Medicare reimbursement for failure to meet or exceed CMS quality performance standards, including performance standards related to anemia management and dialysis adequacy. Bundling initiatives that have been implemented in other healthcare settings have occasionally resulted in lower utilization of services that had not previously been a part of the bundled payment. We are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the new Medicare legislation on our business and at this time cannot predict the impact a bundled payment system for outpatient dialysis might have on sales of EPOGEN® or Aranesp®.  We face risks relating to the calculation of ASP. ASP is calculated by the manufacturer based on a statutorily defined formula and submitted to CMS. MedPAC has recommended that ASP reporting requirements be clarified “to ensure that ASP calculations allocate discounts to reflect the transaction price for each drug.” Under the current ASP system, we allocate our discounts based on the prices paid for individual drugs, according to the terms of our contracts with physicians and other purchasers, and we believe that the resulting ASPs reflect the transaction prices for individual drugs. Moreover, in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule for 2008, the agency clarified that in the absence of specific guidance, manufacturers may continue to make “reasonable assumptions” in the calculation of ASP, consistent with the general requirements and the intent of the Medicare statute and regulations and their customary business practices. The agency stated that it will continue to monitor this issue and may provide more specific guidance in the future.  Other initiatives reviewing the coverage or reimbursement of our products, including those related to safety, could result in less extensive coverage or lower reimbursement and could negatively affect sales of some of our marketed products. For example, on March 14, 2007, shortly after the March 9, 2007 FDA labeling changes for all ESAs, CMS announced that the agency had begun reviewing all Medicare policies related to the administration of ESAs in non-renal disease applications as part of a NCA which is generally CMS’ first step toward developing a NCD. Generally, an NCD is a national policy statement granting, limiting or excluding Medicare     47    Table of Contents  coverage or reimbursement for a specific medical item or service. On May 14, 2007, CMS issued a proposed NCD that was open for public comment through June 13, 2007. On July 30, 2007, CMS issued its Decision Memorandum which was substantially altered from the proposed NCD. On January 14, 2008, CMS issued changes to its Medicare NCD Manual, adding the ESA Decision Memorandum, effective for claims with dates of service on and after July 30, 2007 with an implementation date of April 7, 2008. In the Decision Memorandum, CMS determined that ESA treatment was not reasonable and necessary for certain clinical conditions, and established Medicare coverage parameters for FDA-approved ESA use in oncology.  We believe this restriction on reimbursement of ESAs in the Decision Memorandum has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the use, reimbursement and sales of Aranesp®, and our business and results of operations. Additionally, to our knowledge, although no private payors have fully implemented the Decision Memorandum to date, many private payors have implemented the portions of the restrictions included in the Decision Memorandum that most commonly reflect the prescriber package insert. Further, we believe many healthcare providers have reduced ESA utilization for all of their patients regardless of insurance coverage. While we cannot fully predict the further impact of the Decision Memorandum on how, or under what circumstances, healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our ESAs, it had a significant impact to our business in 2007 and 2008 and we believe that it may continue to impact us in the future.  In addition, the FDA held a joint meeting of the CRDAC and the DSaRMAC on September 11, 2007 to evaluate safety data on ESA use in renal disease. On July 31, 2008, CMS issued a listing of potential topics for future NCDs as a step to increase transparency in the NCD process, which included as potential topics the use of ESAs in ESRD and CKD. Also included in the initial potential future NCD topic list is the category of thrombopoiesis stimulating agents (platelet growth factors), the category of drugs that includes Nplate®. CMS has not announced whether it will proceed to a NCD for ESAs in ESRD or CKD, or for thrombopoiesis stimulating agents, and we cannot predict whether either ESAs in the renal setting or thrombopoiesis stimulating agents will be the subject of a future NCD; however, any final NCD for ESAs in the renal setting, which may include non-coverage and/or new dosing and treatment restrictions similar to those proposed in Decision Memorandum for treatment of anemia in oncology with ESAs, would negatively affect use, reduce reimbursement and coverage, negatively affect product sales of our ESA products and may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  If, and when, reimbursement rates or availability for our marketed products changes adversely or if we fail to obtain adequate reimbursement for our current or future products, healthcare providers may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them, which could reduce the use of our products or cause us to reduce the price of our products. This could result in lower product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations. For example, the use of EPOGEN® in the United States in connection with treatment for ESRD is funded primarily by the U.S. federal government. In early 1997, CMS, formerly known as Healthcare Financing Administration (“HCFA”), instituted a reimbursement change for EPOGEN®, which materially and adversely affected our EPOGEN® sales until the policies were revised. In addition, following the update to the ESA labeling and associated revisions in compendia, nearly all Medicare contractors dropped reimbursement for Aranesp® for anemia of cancer. (See “— Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.”) Also, we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in the United States, Europe and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products, which may adversely impact product sales. In addition, we believe the new U.S. presidential administration, together with Congress, will shape U.S. healthcare policy in the coming months and years, and we expect that healthcare reform efforts could include long-term changes to coverage and reimbursement that may have a significant impact on our business. Further, when a new therapeutic product is approved, the governmental and/or private coverage and reimbursement for that product is uncertain and a failure to demonstrate clear clinical and/or comparative value associated with the use of a new therapeutic product as compared to existing therapeutic products or practices may result in inadequate or no reimbursement. We cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for our approved products or product candidates, including those at a late stage of development, and current reimbursement policies for marketed products may change at any time. Sales of all our products are and will be affected by government and     48    Table of Contents  private payor reimbursement policies. Reduction in reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and results of operations.  If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.  The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. To date, there has emerged no consistent policy regarding breadth of claims allowed in such companies’ patents. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude or delay commercialization of products. We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in patent litigation. However, a patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the product that is alleged to infringe to market and we may be subject to competition during certain periods of litigation. Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, products approved by the FDA under a NDA may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitors before the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act has expired and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. For example, on July 25, 2008, we, NPS Pharmaceuticals and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, filed a lawsuit against Teva and Barr for infringement of four Sensipar® patents. The lawsuit is based on ANDAs filed by Teva and Barr which seek approval to market generic versions of Sensipar® before expiration of the patents. This lawsuit is described in Note 10, “Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities; required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.  Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. We have filed applications for a number of patents and have been granted patents or obtained rights relating to erythropoietin, natural and recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, etanercept, cinacalcet, panitumumab, romiplostim and our product candidates. We market our erythropoietin, recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, etanercept, cinacalcet, panitumumab and romiplostim products as EPOGEN® (Epoetin alfa), NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim), Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa), Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), Enbrel® (etanercept), Sensipar®/Mimpara® (cinacalcet), Vectibix® (panitumumab) and Nplate® (romiplostim), respectively. With respect to our material patents, we have had a number of G-CSF patent expiries in the United States.  We also have been granted or obtained rights to patents in Europe relating to erythropoietin, G-CSF, pegfilgrastim (pegylated G-CSF), etanercept, darbepoetin alfa, cinacalcet, panitumumab and romiplostim. Our principal European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December 12, 2004 and our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expired on August 22, 2006. As these patents have expired, some companies have and we believe others may receive approval for and market biosimilar (as they are generally known in the EU) and other products to compete with these products in the EU presenting additional competition to our products. (See “— Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.”)  We may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs and not achieve or maintain anticipated cost savings from our restructuring plan.  As a result of various regulatory and reimbursement developments that began in 2007 and, in particular those affecting our marketed ESA products, on August 15, 2007, we announced a plan to restructure our world-    49    Table of Contents  wide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing to make significant R&D investments and build the framework for our future growth. As part of the restructuring plan, we reduced staff, made changes to certain capital projects, closed certain production operations and abandoned leases primarily for certain R&D facilities that will not be used in our operations. Through December 31, 2008, we have completed substantially all of these actions and reduced costs in 2008. Our ability to maintain these savings is dependent upon various future developments, some of which are beyond our control. During 2008, we identified certain additional initiatives designed to further assist in improving our cost structure. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits and savings from our recent restructuring efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If we are unable to achieve or maintain all of the resulting savings or benefits to our business or other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Further, if we were to experience additional changes to our business or redesign certain processes to achieve increased efficiencies, we may face further restructuring and/or reorganization activities in the future.  In addition, our reduction of staff was completed through a combination of a voluntary transition program and an involuntary reduction in force. In order to be successful and build our framework for future growth, we must continue to execute and deliver on our core business initiatives with fewer human resources and losses of intellectual capital. We must also attract, retain and motivate key employees including highly qualified management, scientific, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel who are critical to our business. We may not be able to attract, retain or motivate qualified employees in the future and our inability to do so may adversely affect our business.  Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.  Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payors, and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies and reimbursement of our products by government and private payors. (See “— Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, and to the extent that access to and reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”) Organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products. Recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased use and/or dosage of our products. Some examples of agency and organizational guidelines include:        •    On August 30, 2007, the National Kidney Foundation (the “NKF”) distributed to the nephrology community final updated Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (“KDOQI”) clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in CKD. The NKF’s Anemia Work Group conducted an extensive review of results from 26 new and existing randomized controlled trials, comparing the risks and benefits of a range of Hb therapeutic targets in CKD patients. Based on this review, the NKF-KDOQI™ Anemia Work Group recommended in their 2007 Update to the NKF-KDOQI™ Anemia Management Guidelines that physicians target Hb in the range of 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL, and also stipulated that the target not be above 13 g/dL.         •    On February 2, 2007, following the reported results from our AoC 103 Study, the USP DI Drug Reference Guides removed Aranesp® in the treatment of AoC. Thereafter, Aranesp® use in AoC essentially ceased.  Any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price for our common stock.    50    Table of Contents We may not be able to develop commercial products.  We intend to continue to make significant R&D investments. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&D projects produce a commercial product. Product candidates or new indications for existing products (collectively, “product candidates”) that appear promising in the early phases of development, such as in early human clinical trials, may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:        •    the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results        •    the product candidate was not effective or more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness        •    the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals        •    the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use        •    the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize        •    other parties have or may have proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all        •    the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics        •    we and certain of our licensees, partners or independent investigators may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities        •    the regulatory pathway to approval for product candidates is uncertain or not well-defined  For example, we announced that after discussions with the FDA we have decided not to file for approval of motesanib in refractory thyroid cancer until there is more clarity on what would constitute an appropriate regulatory filing package for that indication. We believe that the safety concerns around our ESAs expressed by the FDA must be addressed to the agency’s satisfaction before new indications or expanded labeling of our ESA products will likely be approved.  Further, several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process, including, but not limited to, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“BDNF”), Megakaryocyte Growth and Development Factor (“MGDF”) and Glial Cell Lined-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“GDNF”). For example, in 1997, we announced the failure of BDNF for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s Disease, because the product candidate, when administered by injection, did not produce acceptable clinical results for a specific use after a phase 3 trial, even though BDNF had progressed successfully through preclinical and earlier clinical trials. In addition, in 1998, we discontinued development of MGDF, a novel platelet growth factor, at the phase 3 trial stage after several people in platelet donation trials developed low platelet counts and neutralizing antibodies. Also, in June 2004, we announced that the phase 2 study of GDNF for the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease did not meet the primary study endpoint upon completion of nine months of the double-blind treatment phase of the study even though a small phase 1 pilot investigator-initiated open-label study over a three-year period appeared to result in improvements for advanced Parkinson’s disease patients. Subsequently, in the fall of 2004 we discontinued clinical development of GDNF in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease after several patients in the phase 2 study developed neutralizing antibodies and new preclinical data in rhesus monkeys showed that GDNF caused irreversible damage to the area of the brain critical to movement control and coordination. On February 11, 2005, we confirmed our previous decision to halt clinical trials of GDNF and, as a part of that decision and based on thorough scientific review, we also concluded that we will not provide GDNF to the 48 patients who participated in clinical trials that were terminated in the fall of 2004. Of course, there may be other factors that prevent us from marketing a product. We cannot guarantee we will be able to produce or manufacture commercially successful products. (See “— Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations may limit     51    Table of Contents  supply of our products and limit our product sales; timing of supply may also be affected by operation of our distribution and logistics centers and providers.”; “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products or conduct other potentially limiting or costly risk management activities if we or others identify side effects or safety concerns after our products are on the market.” and “— Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.”)  Our business may be affected by government investigations or litigation.  We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to various patent matters, government investigations, our business operations, government requests for information and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Matters required to be disclosed by us are set forth in Note 10, “Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements and are updated as required in subsequently filed Form 10-Qs. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that affects how we operate our business. Consequently, it is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  We have received subpoenas from a number of government entities, including the U.S. Attorney’s Offices for the Eastern District of New York and the Western District of Washington, as well as the Attorneys General of New York and New Jersey. The federal subpoenas have been issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. 3486), while the Attorneys General subpoenas have been issued pursuant to state specific statutes relating to consumer fraud laws and state false claims acts. In general, the subpoenas request documents relating to the sales and marketing of our products, and our collection and dissemination of information reflecting clinical research as to the safety and efficacy of our ESAs. To the extent it is alleged in a proceeding that we are in violation of the various federal and state laws that govern the sales and marketing of its products, then a decision adverse to our interests could result in federal criminal liability and/or federal or state civil or administrative liability, and thus could result in substantial financial damages or criminal penalties. In addition, as current macroeconomic conditions place increasing fiscal pressure on governments, we may see new governmental investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows in the period in which such liabilities are incurred.  We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims.  Product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management’s attention, and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Amgen and Immunex have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products.  Our revenues may fluctuate and our operating results are subject to fluctuations and these fluctuations could cause financial results to be below expectations and our stock price is volatile, which could adversely affect your investment.  Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons, some of which we cannot control. For example, primarily as a result of various regulatory and reimbursement developments involving ESA products that began in 2007, our anemia product sales, in particular sales of Aranesp®, for 2007 were materially adversely impacted. Even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections as some of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term and cannot be reduced within a short period of time to offset reductions in revenue. Further, primarily as a     52    Table of Contents  result of the various regulatory and reimbursement developments impacting ESA products, on August 15, 2007, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure. As of December 31, 2008, we have completed substantially all of the actions initially included in our restructuring plan and have incurred approximately $887 million in charges. During 2008, we identified certain additional initiatives designed to further assist in improving our cost structure. The estimated cost of these additional initiatives is $95 million to $135 million. As a result of these initiatives and certain minor changes in expected costs associated with the actions initially included in our restructuring plan, the amount of total charges currently expected to be incurred in connection with our restructuring plan, including implementation costs, is $950 million to $985 million. Our operating results have and may continue to fluctuate and be adversely impacted as a result of these restructuring charges. (See “— We may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs and not achieve or maintain anticipated cost savings from our restructuring plan.”) In addition, in the event that the actual restructuring charges exceed our latest estimate, this may cause our operating results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result of the above or other challenges, including further label revisions to our ESAs, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Additionally, our stock price, like that of other biotechnology companies, is volatile. For example, in the fifty-two weeks prior to December 31, 2008, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a high of $66.51 per share to a low of $39.16 per share.  Our revenues, operating results and stock price may be affected by a number of factors, such as:        •    adverse developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products        •    changes in the government’s or private payors’ reimbursement policies, particularly for supportive cancer care products, or prescribing guidelines for our products        •    current volatility and disruption of the financial markets        •    evolving medical care in treating cancer requiring less use of supportive cancer care products and/or changes in chemotherapy usage patterns        •    inability to maintain regulatory approval of marketed products or manufacturing facilities        •    actual or anticipated clinical trial results of ours or our licensees, partners or independent investigators        •    business development or licensing activities        •    product development or other business announcements by us or our competitors        •    regulatory matters or actions, such as label changes or risk management activities, including a REMS        •    lower than expected demand for our products or a change in product mix either or both of which may result in less than optimal utilization of our manufacturing facilities and the potential to incur excess capacity or impairment charges        •    changes in our product contracting and related pricing strategies        •    changes in wholesaler buying patterns        •    increased competition from new or existing products        •    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates        •    announcements in the scientific and research community        •    intellectual property and legal matters        •    actual or anticipated product supply constraints        •    broader economic, industry and market trends unrelated to our performance  Of course, there may be other factors that affect our revenues, operating results and stock price in any given period. In addition, if our revenues, earnings or other financial results in any period fail to meet the investment community’s expectations, there could be an immediate adverse impact on our stock price.    53    Table of Contents Current levels of market volatility are unprecedented and adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to access cost-effective sources of funding and our investment in marketable securities may be subject to market, interest and credit risk that could reduce their value.  The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption which, particularly during the latter part of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, has led to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. We currently have sufficient cash to repay the $1.0 billion of our 4.00% notes due in November 2009. Historically, we have occasionally and opportunistically accessed the capital markets to support certain business activities including acquisitions, in-licensing activities, share repurchases and to refinance existing debt. In the future, we may not be able to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We have some exposure to financial institutions which have come under pressure as a result of the current credit crisis. For example, we have historically had 16 financial institutions participate in our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility including a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (“Lehman”), which had a $178 million commitment. Lehman declared bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, and the subsidiary participant in our credit facility subsequently declared bankruptcy on October 5, 2008. Although we have never drawn on our credit facilities and do not currently anticipate any need to do so, we would not anticipate the ability to access this specific commitment provided by Lehman in the future. Additionally, the conversion feature of our 0.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 and our 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 are hedged pursuant to transactions entered into with two financial institutions. We have also entered into interest rate swap agreements for certain of our outstanding debt and routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with financial institutions as counterparties. Additional bankruptcies in the financial sector could limit our ability to replace these transactions on favorable terms, or at all, or to manage the risks inherent in our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Additionally, we maintain a significant portfolio of fixed-income based investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and  other factors which may result in other than temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of these events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on the sale of investments. We seek to mitigate these risks with the help of our investment advisors by generally investing in high quality securities and continuously monitoring the overall risk of our portfolio. To date, we have not realized any material impairments within our investment portfolio.  The volatility of the current financial markets and the general economic slowdown may magnify certain risks that affect our business.  Sales of our principal products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, including governments and private insurance plans. (See “— Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, and to the extent that access to and reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”) As a result of the volatility of the current financial markets and the general economic slowdown, our third-party payors may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and/or private payor healthcare programs could have a material adverse affect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations.  In addition, as a result of the volatile financial markets and economic slowdown, some employers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees. Job losses or changes may also result in reduced levels of coverage for some individuals, potentially resulting in lower levels of healthcare coverage for themselves or their families. These reductions may affect patients’ ability to afford healthcare and/or cause them to forego or postpone treatment to reduce out-of-pocket healthcare costs as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations or for other reasons. These changes may result in reduced demand for our products, which could adversely affect our business     54    Table of Contents  and results of operations. Any resulting decrease in demand for our products could also cause us to experience excess inventory write-offs and/or excess capacity charges at certain of our manufacturing facilities.  Additionally, we rely upon third-parties for certain parts of our business, including licensees and partners, wholesale distributors of our products, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and single third-party suppliers. Because of the recent volatility in the financial markets, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third-parties which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. For example, current markets conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. In addition, although we monitor our distributors’, customers’ and suppliers’ financial condition and their liquidity, in order to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations.  We rely on single third-party suppliers for some of our raw materials, medical devices and components; if these third-parties fail to supply these items, we may be unable to supply our products.  Certain raw materials necessary for commercial and clinical manufacturing and formulation of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Also, certain medical devices and components necessary for formulation, fill and finish of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Certain of these raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of these unaffiliated third-party suppliers and, in some cases, such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved that other supplier.  We would be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices or components for an indeterminate period of time if these third-party single-source suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials or products to us for any reason, including:        •    regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others        •    adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier        •    unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components        •    labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of an avian or pandemic flu outbreak or otherwise        •    failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality failures, product contamination and/or recall  These events could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. For example, we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility without impact on our ability to supply these products. However, we may experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints and/or stock-outs of our products. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing and the formulation of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and HSA.  Some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. We are investigating alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of certain biologically-sourced raw materials as such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. Also, some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the drug manufacturing process.  A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction of the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials, which may be sourced from other countries, used in the manufacture of our     55    Table of Contents  products could adversely impact or disrupt our commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. This could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially.  Further, any disruptions or delays by us or by third-party suppliers or partners in converting to alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes or our ability to gain regulatory approval for the alternative materials and manufacturing processes could increase our associated costs or result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value of certain related assets, which could have a material and adverse affect on our results of operations.  Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales; timing of supply may also be affected by operation of our distribution and logistics centers and providers.  We currently manufacture and market all of our principal products, and we plan to manufacture and market many of our product candidates. Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. (See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products or conduct other potentially limiting or costly risk management activities if we or others identify side effects or safety concerns after our products are on the market.”)  We currently manufacture our products and product candidates at our manufacturing facilities located in Thousand Oaks and Fremont, California; Boulder and Longmont, Colorado; West Greenwich, Rhode Island; Bothell, Washington and Juncos, Puerto Rico. (See “— We manufacture and formulate, fill and finish substantially all our products at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at this facility, we may not be able to supply these products.”)  Additionally, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of ENBREL, Sensipar®/Mimpara® and Nplate® as well as our late-stage product candidate denosumab and plan to use contract manufacturers to produce a number of our other late-stage product candidates. (See “— We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our bulk supply and the formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL.”) Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which is impacted by many manufacturing variables including:        •    availability or contamination of raw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier        •    capacity of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers        •    facility contamination by microorganisms or viruses        •    labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of an avian or pandemic flu outbreak        •    compliance with regulatory requirements        •    changes in forecasts of future demand        •    timing and actual number of production runs        •    production success rates and bulk drug yields        •    timing and outcome of product quality testing  If we have problems in one or more of these or other manufacturing variables, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. For example, in the second quarter of 2002, the prior co-marketers with respect to ENBREL experienced a brief period where no ENBREL was available to fill new patient prescriptions, primarily due to variation in the expected production yield from BI Pharma. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients,     56    Table of Contents  physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, and sales of our products will be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales and results of operations.  We manufacture and contract manufacture, price, sell, distribute and market or co-market our products for their approved indications. These activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, such as the FDA and CMS, as well as in foreign countries, including European countries, Canada, Australia and Japan. Although we have obtained regulatory approval for our marketed products, these products and our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo a potentially lengthy FDA or other regulatory approval process and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build and license a new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. In order to maintain supply, mitigate risks associated with the majority of our formulation, fill and finish operations being performed in a single facility and to adequately prepare to launch a number of our late-stage product candidates, in particular denosumab, we must successfully implement a number of manufacturing projects on schedule, operate our facilities at appropriate production capacity over the next few years, optimize manufacturing asset utilization, continue our use of third-party contract manufacturers and maintain a state of regulatory compliance. Key manufacturing projects include: (i) construction, qualification and licensure of a new formulation and filling facility at our Puerto Rico site and (ii) expansion and the related qualification and licensure of our existing bulk protein facilities at our Puerto Rico site for the production of our late-stage product candidate, denosumab.  If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers are subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us for any reason, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. If we are unable to manufacture, market and sell our products, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through a single distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and another in Breda, the Netherlands for Europe and the rest of the world. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers and our third-party logistics providers.  We manufacture and formulate, fill and finish substantially all our products at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at this facility, we may not be able to supply these products.  We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for EPOGEN®, Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®, some formulation, fill and finish operations for ENBREL, and all of the bulk manufacturing for Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. Our global supply of these products is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of this facility. A number of factors could adversely affect our operations, including:        •    power failures        •    breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment        •    improper installation or operation of equipment        •    labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of an avian or pandemic flu outbreak        •    inability of third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and components    57    Table of Contents     •    natural or other disasters, including hurricanes        •    failures to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of the FDA  For example, this facility in Puerto Rico has experienced manufacturing component shortages and there was evidence of adverse trends in the microbial bioburden of the production environment that reduced the production output in the past. Although these experiences in Puerto Rico have not impacted our ability to supply product in the past, the same or other problems may result in our being unable to supply these products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. Although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against certain business interruption losses, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. The extent of the coverage of our insurance could limit our ability to mitigate for lost sales and such losses could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. (See “— Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales; timing of supply may also be affected by operation of our distribution and logistics centers and providers.”)  We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our bulk supply and the formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL.  Under a collaboration and global supply agreement, we and Wyeth share the total worldwide bulk supply of ENBREL produced by our Rhode Island manufacturing facility, BI Pharma’s manufacturing facility in Germany and Wyeth’s manufacturing facility in Ireland. (See also “— We face uncertainties related to the recently announced Wyeth / Pfizer merger.”) Our ENBREL supply forecasts rely on certain assumptions of how much ENBREL each of these manufacturing facilities is expected to produce. If any of these manufacturing facilities are unable to produce in accordance with our or Wyeth’s expectations, the worldwide supply of ENBREL could be adversely affected materially. In such cases, we may be required to allocate supply for Wyeth’s benefit. To the extent that there is a shortfall in worldwide production, our supply of ENBREL could be adversely affected. Additionally, the costs associated with a shortfall or failure in production of ENBREL would be borne by both parties.  We currently produce a substantial portion of the annual ENBREL supply at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility. However, we also depend on third parties for a significant portion of our ENBREL bulk supply as well as for some of the formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL that we manufacture. BI Pharma is our third-party contract manufacturer of ENBREL bulk drug; accordingly, our U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL is currently significantly dependent on BI Pharma’s production schedule for ENBREL. We would be unable to produce ENBREL in sufficient quantities to substantially offset shortages in BI Pharma’s scheduled production if BI Pharma or other third-party contract manufacturers used for the formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL bulk drug were to cease or interrupt production or services or otherwise fail to supply materials, products or services to us for any reason, including labor shortages or disputes, regulatory requirements or action or contamination of product lots or product recalls.  For example, in the second quarter of 2002, the prior co-marketers with respect to ENBREL experienced a brief period where no ENBREL was available to fill new patient prescriptions, primarily due to variation in the expected production yield from BI Pharma. We cannot guarantee that an alternative third-party contract manufacturer would be available on a timely basis or at all. This in turn could materially reduce our ability to satisfy demand for ENBREL, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.  Among the factors that could affect our actual supply of ENBREL at any time include, without limitation, BI Pharma’s and our Rhode Island facility’s bulk drug production scheduling. For example, BI Pharma does not produce ENBREL continuously; rather, it produces the bulk drug substance through a series of periodic campaigns throughout the year. Our Rhode Island manufacturing facility is currently dedicated to ENBREL production. The amount of commercial inventory available to us at any time depends on a variety of factors, including the timing and actual number of BI Pharma’s production runs, the actual number of runs at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility, and, for either the Rhode Island or BI Pharma facilities, the level of production yields and success rates, the timing and outcome of product quality testing and the amount of formulation, fill and finish capacity. We are also dependent on third-parties for some formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL bulk     58    Table of Contents  drug substance manufactured at our Rhode Island facility. If third-party formulation, fill and finish manufacturers are unable to provide sufficient capacity or are otherwise unable to provide services to us, the supply of ENBREL could be adversely affected materially.  Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.  We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. For example, ENBREL competes in certain circumstances with products marketed by J&J, Abbott, Biogen, Barr, Genentech, BMS, Novartis and Sanofi-Aventis and others, as well as the generic drug methotrexate, and may face competition from other potential therapies being developed, including J&J’s CNTO 1275 (ustekinumab) and CNTO 148 (golimumab), Roche’s Actemra (tocilizumab) and UCB’s Cimzia® (PEGylated anti-TNF). Additionally, in the first quarter of 2008 Abbott received approval from the FDA to market HUMIRA® as a treatment for adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and HUMIRA® now competes with ENBREL in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments and ENBREL has experienced and continues to experience share loss to competitors.  The following table reflects companies and their currently marketed products that primarily compete with Aranesp® in the United States and Europe in the supportive cancer care and nephrology segments, unless otherwise indicated:             Territory    Competitor Marketed Product    Competitor   U.S.   PROCRIT®(1)   J&J   Europe   EPREX®/ERYPO®   Janssen-Cilag(2)   Europe   NeoRecormon®   Roche   Europe   Retacrit™(3)/Silapo®(3)   Hospira/Stada   Europe   Binocrit®(3)/Epoetin alfa Hexal®(3)/Abseamed®(3)   Sandoz/Hexal/Medice   Europe   MIRCERA®(4)    Roche   Europe   Dynepo®(5)    Shire       (1)  In the United States, Aranesp® competes with PROCRIT® in the supportive cancer care and pre-dialysis settings.     (2)  A subsidiary of J&J.     (3)  Biosimilar product approved and launched in certain EU countries.     (4)  Competes with Aranesp® in the nephrology segment only.     (5)  Shire announced in the second quarter of 2008 that it had decided to stop the commercialization of Dynepo®.  In addition to competition from the above-noted marketed products, a number of companies are developing products that could potentially compete with Aranesp® and/or EPOGEN® in the future. Affymax and Takeda are co-developing Hematide™, an ESA for the treatment of anemia in renal patients. FibroGen is developing FG-2216 and FG-4592, orally active ESAs, for the treatment of anemia and is also studying FG-4592 for the treatment in anemia of CKD. Ratiopharm is developing a biosimilar ESA, EpoTheta, expected to launch in the EU in 2009. Additionally in December 2008, Merck announced the formation of a new biotech division, Merck Bioventures, which is developing a pegylated ESA (MK-2578), which they have announced they expect to launch in 2012. Further, if our currently marketed products are approved for new uses, or if we sell new products, or our competitors get new or expanded indications, we may face new, additional competition that we do not face today. Further, adverse clinical developments for our current products could limit our ability to compete. (See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products or conduct other potentially limiting or costly risk management activities if we or others identify side effects or safety concerns after our products are on the market.”) Our products may compete against products that have lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, are easier to administer or that are otherwise competitive with our products.    59    Table of Contents Our principal European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December 12, 2004 and our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expired on August 22, 2006. As these patents have expired, some companies have and other companies may receive approval for and market biosimilar or other products to compete with our products in the EU, presenting additional competition to our products. For example, in September 2008, the European Commission issued marketing authorizations for the first G-CSF biosimilar products to Ratiopharm’s Ratiograstim®/Filgrastim Ratiopharm®, CT Arzneimittel’s Biograstim® and Teva’s Tevagrastim®. Ratiopharm launched its G-CSF biosimilar product, Ratiograstim®, in the United Kingdom and Germany in October 2008 and in the Netherlands in January 2009, and is expected to launch it in other European markets in 2009. Teva has stated that it would begin marketing Tevagrastim throughout Europe in 2009. In February 2009, the European Commission issued marketing authorizations for two additional G-CSF biosimilar products to Sandoz’s Zarzio® and Hexal’s Filgrastim Hexal®. If these companies’ launch plans are successful, there may be as many as six G-CSF biosimilars available in 2009 on the European market. These G-CSF biosimilar products would compete with Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. We cannot predict to what extent the entry of biosimilar products or other competing products will impact future Aranesp®, Neulasta® or NEUPOGEN® sales in the EU. Our inability to compete effectively could reduce sales which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  In 2006, the EMEA developed and issued final regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. The final guidelines included clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products including erythropoietins and G-CSFs, which guidance recommends that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct fairly extensive pharmacodynamic, toxicological, clinical safety studies and a pharmacovigilance program. In the United States, there currently is no legal approval pathway for the abbreviated approval of BLAs for biosimilars. A number of events would need to occur before these products could enter the market, including passage of legislation by Congress to create a new approval pathway and, depending on the specific provisions of any such legislation, promulgation of associated regulations or guidance by the FDA. In 2007, several members of Congress expressed interest in the issue, a number of bills were introduced, the House of Representatives and the Senate held hearings on biosimilars, and the Senate Committee on HELP voted on legislation in June 2007. In 2008, additional legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives, but no final legislation was considered or passed in either chamber of Congress, with all introduced bills expiring at the end of the Congressional session (end of the year). Given the continuing interest of Congress in the issue and in healthcare reform generally, it is likely that legislation on biosimilars will be introduced in 2009 and possibly passed into law. The new U.S. presidential administration has also expressed an interest in passing legislation regarding biosimilars. It is unknown what type of regulatory framework, what legal provisions, and what timeframes for issuance of regulations or guidance any final legislation would contain. Until such legislation is created, we cannot predict when biosimilars could appear in the United States.  Certain of our competitors, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, market products or are actively engaged in R&D in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. In the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs approved for other indications that may be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. As with Merck’s recent announcement, pharmaceutical companies and generic manufacturers that have traditionally developed and marketed “small molecule” pharmaceutical products may elect to expand into the biotechnology field, and some of these companies may seek to develop biosimilar products to compete with our products. Large pharmaceutical corporations may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and human resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. These resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. Business combinations among our competitors may also increase competition and the resources available to our competitors.    60    Table of Contents We must continue to build the framework for our future growth, and if we fail to execute on our initiatives our business could be adversely affected.  As a result of developments in 2007 and, in particular the regulatory and reimbursement changes to our ESA products, on August 15, 2007, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing to make significant R&D investments and build the framework for our future growth. We face a number of risks, some of which we cannot completely control. For example:        •    we will need to manage complexities associated with a large and geographically diverse organization        •    we will need to manage and execute large, complex and global clinical trials        •    we will need to significantly expand our sales and marketing resources to launch our late-stage product candidate, denosumab        •    we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing capacity for both commercial and clinical supply        •    we have implemented a new global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system to support our increasing complex business and business processes and need to ensure that the new system continues to operate without disruptions to our operations  Of course, there may be other risks and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully manage these or other risks. If we fail to execute on our initiatives in these ways or others, such failure could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of free-standing dialysis clinic businesses may negatively impact our bargaining power and profit margins.  The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales are made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of these products, EPOGEN®, is primarily sold to free-standing dialysis clinics, which have experienced significant consolidation. Two organizations, DaVita Inc. and Fresenius own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and account for a significant majority of all EPOGEN® sales in the free-standing dialysis clinic setting. In October 2006, we entered into a five-year sole sourcing and supply agreement with an affiliate of Fresenius, on its behalf and on behalf of certain of its affiliates, whereby they have agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to supply, all of Fresenius’ commercial requirements for ESAs for use in managing the anemia of its hemodialysis patients in the United States and Puerto Rico, based on forecasts provided by Fresenius and subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement.  These entities’ purchasing leverage has increased due to this concentration and consolidation which may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products or fees for other services, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margins. The results of these developments may have a material adverse effect on our product sales and results of operations.  Our marketing of ENBREL is dependent in part upon Wyeth.  Under a co-promotion agreement, we and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL in the United States and Canada. A management committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from us and Wyeth is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL including strategic planning, the approval of an annual marketing plan and the establishment of a brand team. The brand team, with equal representation from us and Wyeth, prepares and implements the annual marketing plan, which includes a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party, and is responsible for all sales activities. If Wyeth fails to effectively deliver on its marketing commitments to us or if we and Wyeth fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, our sales of ENBREL may be adversely affected materially. (See also “— We face uncertainties related to the recently announced Wyeth/Pfizer merger.”)    61    Table of Contents We face uncertainties related to the recently announced Wyeth/Pfizer merger.  We are party to a number of agreements with Wyeth relating to the manufacturing, marketing and selling of ENBREL, including a co-promotion agreement and a global supply agreement. On January 26, 2009, Wyeth and Pfizer announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Pfizer will acquire Wyeth in a cash-and-stock transaction approved by the boards of directors of both companies. Wyeth and Pfizer stated that the transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions, including the approval of Wyeth’s stockholders. While our agreements with Wyeth do not include a change of control provision, if the acquisition transaction is completed, our relationship with Wyeth may be affected in ways we do not anticipate, including changes in Wyeth/Pfizer management, strategy or otherwise.  Our corporate compliance and risk mitigation programs cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or that we effectively manage all operational risks.  The development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the United States and to extensive regulation in foreign countries. (See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products or conduct other potentially limiting or costly risk management activities if we or others identify side effects or safety concerns after our products are on the market.” and “— Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales; timing of supply may also be affected by operation of our distribution and logistics centers and providers.”) While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program, we cannot guarantee you that we, our employees, our consultants or our contractors are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws or all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws. If we or our agents fail to comply with any of these regulations and/or laws, a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation. Additionally, while we have implemented numerous risk mitigation measures, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively mitigate all operational risks. If we fail to effectively mitigate all operational risks, our product supply may be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and results of operations.  Continual process improvement efforts may result in the carrying value of certain existing manufacturing facilities or other assets becoming impaired or other related charges being incurred.  In connection with our continuous process improvement activities, we evaluate our processes and procedures in order to identify opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies in how we conduct our business in order to reduce costs. In particular, we evaluate our manufacturing practices and related processes to increase production yields and/or success rates as well as capacity utilization to gain increased cost efficiencies. Depending on the timing and outcomes of these process improvement initiatives, the carrying value of certain manufacturing or other assets may not be fully recoverable and could result in the recognition of impairment charges and/or the recognition of other related charges. The recognition of such charges, if any, could have a material and adverse affect on our results of operations.    62    Table of Contents   Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
