Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our product development efforts may not result in commercial products”). We plan to expand our R&D capabilities substantially, requiring significant investments over the next several years. In 2006, we are expecting a significant increase in the number, size, duration and complexity of our clinical trials, in particular with respect to denosumab, our late-stage investigational product for osteoporosis, and we expect total research and development expenses to increase by 30-40%. For example, testing denosumab in the osteoporosis setting requires large clinical trials, substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. We expect to start eleven “mega-site” trials (involving 200 or more sites) in 2006 to support denosumab and our other late-stage programs. To execute our clinical trial programs, we need to accelerate the growth of our development organization, implement new management structures and approaches and increase dependence on third-party contract clinical trial providers. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we are planning to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, China, India and some South American countries. We plan to conduct clinical trial activities in these new territories through third-party contract clinical trial providers. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.”) We have major research facilities in the United States as well as a smaller research center in Germany, and clinical development staff in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan (see “Item 2. Properties”). 10     R&D expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $2,314 million, $2,028 million, and $1,655 million, respectively. In 2004, we recorded $554 million for the write-off of acquired IPR&D resulting from the Tularik Inc. (“Tularik”) acquisition (see Note 7, “Acquisitions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The following table is a selection of certain of our product candidates in our therapeutic areas of focus and shows the status of these molecules as of January 26, 2006.

Preclinical studies collect data to show that a molecule is reasonably safe for use in initial small-scale clinical trials. Phase 1 clinical trials investigate safety and proper dose ranges of a product candidate in a small number of human subjects. Phase 2 clinical trials investigate side effect profiles and efficacy of a product candidate in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. Phase 3 clinical trials investigate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. The following represents additional information about certain of our product candidates that are in phase 2 or later human clinical trials. Denosumab (Program formerly identified as AMG 162) Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (“RANKL”), a key mediator of the resorptive phase of bone remodeling. Denosumab is being studied across a range of conditions, including osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, rheumatoid arthritis, bone metastases, and multiple myeloma. Amgen announced interim data from a phase 2 clinical study reporting the clinical effects of denosumab on bone mineral density endpoints in postmenopausal, osteoporotic women. Based on this interim data, phase 3 clinical studies with denosumab were initiated in 2004. Denosumab is also being studied in metastatic bone disease for the treatment of bone metastases to prevent skeletal related events (“SREs”). Phase 2 clinical studies of denosumab in metastatic bone disease were initiated in 2004 and completed enrollment in 2005. Panitumumab Co-developed with Abgenix, Inc. (see “Joint Ventures and Business Relationships — Abgenix, Inc.”), panitumumab (rHuMAb-EGFr) targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFr”). The EGFr pathway is important in normal and tumor cell growth. Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against EGFr and is being evaluated for the treatment of various types of cancer (solid tumor). In phase 2 clinical studies to date, panitumumab has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in advanced, refractory colorectal cancer (“CRC”). In a phase 3 pivotal study examining panitumumab as third-line monotherapy in CRC patients, patients who received panitumumab every two weeks showed a 46 percent decrease in tumor progression rate versus those who received best supportive care alone. Amgen initiated submission of the U.S. biologics license application under CMA pilot program I in December 2005. 12    A non-registrational phase 3b study was initiated in 2005 to evaluate panitumumab plus Avastin in first-line CRC (“PACCE”). Registrational studies in first-line, and second-line CRC, as well as head and neck cancer (“HNC”) are planned for 2006. Panitumumab is also being developed in combination with AMG 706 in the treatment of various solid tumors in a variety of conditions. Phase 1b combination studies in first-line CRC, first-line non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”), and HNC were initiated in 2005. AMG 706 AMG 706 is an oral, multi-kinase inhibitor with both anti-angiogenic and direct antitumor activity achieved by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (“VEGF”) receptors, platelet derived growth factor (“PDGF”) receptor and Kit. By inhibiting multiple receptors, AMG 706 potentially may provide more than one mechanism of action in various cancers. A phase 2 clinical study evaluating AMG 706 monotherapy in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor (“GIST”) has completed enrollment, and a phase 2 trial in advanced thyroid cancer is ongoing. AMG 706 is also being developed in combination with multiple chemotherapy regimens, with and without panitumumab, in the treatment of solid tumors. Phase 1b combination studies in CRC, NSCLC, and other solid tumors are ongoing. These studies are also evaluating the tolerability and safety of twice-daily dosing of AMG 706. AMG 531 AMG 531 is a first-in-class molecule, a protein called a peptibody. The active peptide component stimulates the thrombopoietin (“TPO”) receptor resulting in increased platelet production. It is being investigated for the treatment of immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (“ITP”). ITP is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by an abnormal decrease in platelets, a condition known as thrombocytopenia. Platelets are specialized blood cells that help prevent and stop bleeding by participating in clotting. ITP is characterized by thrombocytopenia that results in bruising and bleeding that is sometimes severe. Phase 2 clinical studies have been completed. Phase 3 clinical studies were initiated in 2005. Phase 2 studies in chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (“CIT”) and myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”) are expected to begin in 2006. AMG 108 AMG 108 is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of interleukin-1 (“IL-1”), a cytokine known to play a role in the joint destruction associated with rheumatoid arthritis. A phase 2 clinical study is under way to investigate the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with AMG 108. Aranesp® Aranesp® is currently being evaluated in phase 3 studies for treatment of anemia in cancer patients not undergoing chemotherapy, a condition known as anemia of cancer. Amgen has completed several phase 2 studies evaluating Aranesp® for treatment of anemia in patients with heart failure. A phase 3 program will be initiated in 2006 to evaluate the effect of treatment of anemia with darbepoetin alfa on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. The Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp® Therapy (“TREAT”) is an approximately 4,000-patient, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial designed to determine the impact of anemia therapy with darbepoetin alfa on mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients with CKD and type 2 (insulin-resistant) diabetes. 13    Kepivance™ (palifermin) Kepivance™ is currently being evaluated in localized radiation and chemotherapy settings to determine its safety and anti-mucositis activity in patients with HNC cancer (phase 3), NSCLC and colon cancer (phase 2). Sensipar® Sensipar® is approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD on dialysis. Currently, a clinical trial is being planned to assess the effects of cinacalcet HCl on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with CKD undergoing maintenance dialysis. Additionally, cinacalcet HCl is being evaluated in studies for use in secondary hyperparathyroidism of chronic renal insufficiency (stage 3 & 4 CKD) and for use in primary hyperparathyroidism. Competition Competition among biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and other companies that research, develop, manufacture, or market biologics and pharmaceuticals is intense and is expected to increase. We compete with these entities in all areas of our business including competing to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical, and operational personnel. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.”) Our products’ competitive position among other biologic and pharmaceutical products may be based on, among other things, patent position, product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, patient convenience/delivery devices and price. We remain committed to vigorously defending our intellectual property and growing our businesses as well as holding or increasing share. For example, the anemia area represents a significant and growing business opportunity. As such, we expect to face increasingly intense competition in this area, including new and existing technologies and competitive pressures associated with follow-on biologics, or biosimilar products as they are known in Europe and Australia (see further discussion below). We are committed to growing our anemia business, which includes impacting outcomes and supporting the development of new standards of care, exploring new technologies in anemia therapy, preparing to compete with biosimilar products in Europe, and defending our intellectual property. Certain of our products are expected to face competition in certain geographic areas from biosimilar products. Our principal European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December 12, 2004 and our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expires on August 22, 2006. We believe that after the expiration of each of these patents, other companies could receive approval for and market biosimilar products to compete with our products in the European Union (“EU”), presenting additional competition to our products. While we do not market erythropoietin in Europe as this right belongs to Johnson & Johnson (through KA), we do market Aranesp® in the EU, which competes with Johnson & Johnson’s EPREX® product, Roche’s Neorecormon® product, and others’ erythropoietin products. We cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU. However, based on an announcement by Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc (“Shire”), we expect that the first competing Epoetin alfa product, manufactured by Shire, may appear on the market in the EU in the first half of 2007. Also, we expect that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the EU beginning in late 2006 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval. We also expect that the first biosimilar G-CSF product may be approved as early as mid-2007 and that it would compete with Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. We cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar products would impact future Aranesp®, Neulasta® or NEUPOGEN® sales in the EU. Our products may compete against products that have lower prices, superior performance, are easier to administer, or that are otherwise competitive with our products. Our inability to compete effectively could adversely affect product sales materially. The EU is currently in the process of developing regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar  14    products. In July 2005, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products (“EMEA”) issued clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products including erythropoietins and granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, which guidance recommends that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct fairly extensive pharmacodynamic, toxicological, clinical safety studies and a pharmacovigilance program. In October 2005, the EMEA confirmed that biosimilar products will be approved under a different legal pathway than the one applicable to generics of small molecule drugs. Based on the process and timing outlined by the EMEA, we believe relevant product specific guidelines are likely to be finalized by the first quarter of 2006. However, we cannot predict what the final EMEA product specific guidelines will be. Certain of our products face substantial competition from products marketed by large pharmaceutical companies, which may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and human resources than we do. In addition, the introduction of new products or the development of new processes by competitors or new information about existing products may result in product replacements or price reductions, even for products protected by patents. Some of our competitors are actively engaged in R&D in areas where we are also performing research and developing product candidates. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is significantly dependent upon the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance contributing to the product’s eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical testing, receive regulatory approval, and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market is expected to be important to our competitive position. In addition, we compete with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies when entering into collaborative arrangements with companies primarily in the biotechnology industry, research organizations and other entities for the research, development and commercialization of technologies, product candidates and marketed products. Other public and privately owned companies, research organizations, academic institutions and governmental agencies conduct a significant amount of R&D in the biotechnology industry. We may face competition in our collaborative arrangements or licensing and acquisition activities from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from these entities. Accordingly, we may have difficulty entering into collaborative arrangements and licensing or acquiring technologies, product candidates and marketed products on acceptable terms. The following provides additional information on competition related to our principal products and selected product candidates in the therapeutic area(s) in which we market or expect to market them. Nephrology Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with CKD could negatively impact product sales for Aranesp® and EPOGEN®. In the United States, Aranesp® and EPOGEN® compete with each other, primarily in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinics. Additionally, Aranesp® competes internationally with other companies’ marketed products to treat anemia associated with CKD. The following table reflects other companies and their currently marketed products that primarily compete with Aranesp® internationally in the nephrology setting.         Amgen Marketed Product               Competitor Marketed Product               Competitor         Aranesp® — International       EPREX®/ERYPO®       Janssen-Cilag(1)     Aranesp® — International       Neorecormon®       F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (“Roche”)      (1) A division of Johnson & Johnson. 15    Roche is developing a pegylated erythropoietin product for the treatment of anemia in the United States that is the same as the product presently marketed and sold in the EU (see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Amgen Inc. v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., et al.”). Transkaryotic Therapies (“TKT”) is also developing a gene-activated erythropoietin for the treatment of anemia (see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Transkaryotic Therapies and Aventis litigation”). In addition, Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd./FibroGen are co-developing an erythropoietic small molecule and Affymax, Inc. (“Affymax”) is developing an erythropoietin mimetic for the treatment of anemia. The first competing Epoetin alpha product, manufactured by Shire, may appear on the market in the EU in the first half of 2007. Supportive cancer care Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with chemotherapy could negatively impact product sales for Aranesp®. In the United States, Aranesp® directly competes with other currently marketed products which treat anemia associated with chemotherapy. Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® could face competition in some circumstances from companies marketing or developing treatments for neutropenia associated with chemotherapy, for bone marrow and PBPC transplant patients, and AML. Neulasta® also competes with NEUPOGEN® in the United States and Europe. United States NEUPOGEN® sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to Neulasta®. However, we believe that most of the conversion in the United States has occurred. In Europe, we plan to continue to actively convert NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta®, emphasizing its less frequent dosing requirements as compared to NEUPOGEN®. However, we cannot accurately predict the rate or timing of future conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta® in Europe. The following table reflects companies and their currently marketed products that primarily compete with Aranesp®, Neulasta®, and NEUPOGEN® in the United States and internationally in the supportive cancer care setting.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., et al.”). TKT is also developing its gene-activated erythropoietin for the treatment of anemia (see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Transkaryotic Therapies and Aventis litigation”). Yamanouchi/FibroGen are co-developing an erythropoietic small molecule, and Affymax is developing an erythropoietin mimetic for the treatment of anemia. 16     Inflammatory disease ENBREL could face competition in some circumstances from companies developing or marketing rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and psoriasis treatments. Current treatments for these indications include generic methotrexate and other products. The following table reflects companies and their currently marketed products that primarily compete with our own product in the United States and internationally in the inflammatory disease setting.

(“Pfizer”)      (1) A division of Johnson & Johnson. In addition, a number of companies have cytokine inhibitors in development including GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GlaxoSmithKline”), Pfizer, Repligen Corporation, and Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Product candidates We are currently developing product candidates, including denosumab, panitumumab, and others, which, if approved, we expect will enter into highly competitive markets. These product candidates will face substantial competition from products currently marketed as well as those under development by other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The bone loss setting, in which denosumab would compete, is currently comprised of three therapeutic classes: bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and anabolic agents. The oncology setting, in which panitumumab would compete, is currently comprised of several therapeutic classes, including, but not limited to, cytotoxic agents, and VEGF and EGFr inhibitors. Competitive intensity will increase in the bone loss and oncology settings with the expected approval of new agents. The following table reflects other companies and their currently marketed products that will primarily compete with denosumab and panitumumab, if approved:         Amgen Product Candidate               Competitor Marketed Product               Potential Competitor         Denosumab       Fosamax®       Merck & Co., Inc.

We operate clinical and commercial manufacturing facilities in several locations throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico (see “Item 2. Properties”). Bulk Commercial Manufacturing Our bulk commercial manufacturing facilities are located in Longmont, Colorado, which produce Epoetin alfa and Aranesp®; West Greenwich, Rhode Island, where we produce a substantial portion of our annual ENBREL supply; Thousand Oaks, California where we produce Epoetin alfa, Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®; and Juncos, Puerto Rico where, starting in September 2005, we began manufacturing Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. In September 2005, a second manufacturing facility in Rhode Island received FDA approval for the production of ENBREL. Commercial quantities of ENBREL produced at Rhode Island are insufficient to fill the current level of demand for this product. We and Wyeth also have a contract manufacturing agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG (“BI Pharma”) for the production of additional supply of ENBREL. We also have a global supply agreement with Wyeth related to the manufacture, supply, inventory, and allocation of supplies of ENBREL. Under this agreement, we and Wyeth share the total worldwide supply of ENBREL produced by Amgen’s Rhode Island manufacturing facilities, BI Pharma’s manufacturing facility in Germany, and Wyeth’s manufacturing facility in Ireland. Our supply of ENBREL is significantly dependent on product manufactured by BI Pharma, and, accordingly, we have made significant purchase commitments to BI Pharma (see Note 8, “Commitments and contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Under the supply agreement, BI Pharma has reserved a specified level of production capacity for ENBREL, and our supply under these purchase commitments for ENBREL is manufactured from that reserved production capacity. We are required to submit a rolling three-year forecast for manufacturing the bulk drug for ENBREL, and a rolling forecast for a shorter period for the number of finished vials of ENBREL. We have submitted firm orders for the maximum production capacity that BI Pharma currently has reserved for ENBREL. We will be responsible for substantial payments to BI Pharma if we fail to use a specified percentage of the production capacity that BI Pharma has reserved for ENBREL each calendar year or if the BI Pharma supply agreement is terminated prematurely under specified conditions. In addition to producing our own commercial quantities of Epoetin alfa, we also supply Epoetin alfa in the United States to Johnson & Johnson under a supply agreement (see “Joint Ventures and Business Relationships — Johnson & Johnson”). Formulation, Fill, and Finish Our operations in Puerto Rico, perform all of the formulation, fill, and finish activities for our commercial supply of Epoetin alfa, Aranesp®, Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN® and some of our supply of ENBREL. In addition to the formulation, fill, and finish for ENBREL performed in Puerto Rico, BI Pharma also performs these activities for the ENBREL they manufacture and supply to us under the above-noted contract manufacturing agreement. Additionally, a certain portion of the formulation, fill, and finish activities for ENBREL is performed by a third-party contract manufacturer other than BI Pharma. To keep up with the growing demand for our products, we are operating the Puerto Rico formulation, fill, and finish facility at nearly full production capacity. In addition to the above-noted manufacturing  18    activities, our operations in Puerto Rico perform key manufacturing support functions including quality control, process development, procurement and production scheduling. Our global supply of our principal products is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these Puerto Rico facilities (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We formulate, fill, and finish substantially all our products at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at this facility, we may not be able to supply these products”). Clinical Manufacturing Bulk manufacturing of our products and product candidates for use in clinical trials is performed at our facilities in California, Colorado, Rhode Island, and Washington, by certain collaboration partners, and by third-party manufacturers. We perform formulation, fill, and finish activities for products and product candidates used in clinical applications at our facilities in California and Puerto Rico. We also utilize contract manufacturers for these activities. Manufacturing Initiatives We actively manage our inventory supply produced by our manufacturing facilities and the supply produced by our third-party contract manufacturers. Our manufacturing capacity and third-party contract manufacturing agreements have increased and are expected to continue to increase to supply the growth in our commercial products and to support our expanding R&D activities (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We have grown rapidly, and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted”). To mitigate the risks associated with our rapid growth and the concentration of manufacturing activity in Puerto Rico, we have several ongoing and new planned initiatives in place. With respect to these risks and meeting our objective to supply every patient every time with our medicines, we are in the process of increasing the number of third-party contract manufacturers and building additional manufacturing capacity. The most significant of our efforts to increase capacity and to reduce concentration is our recently announced project to construct a process development, bulk manufacturing, and formulation, fill, and finish facility in Ireland. Construction of the facility in Ireland is expected to begin in 2006. Other capacity expansion projects that are already in process or are expected to begin in 2006 include the construction of an additional formulation, fill, and finish facility in Puerto Rico and upgrades to the existing formulation, fill, and finish operations, and the further expansion of our bulk manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico to begin to produce Epoetin alfa and Aranesp® and to increase production of Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. Raw Materials Certain raw materials, medical devices, and components necessary for our commercial manufacturing of our products are proprietary products of other companies, and in some cases, such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with the FDA such that they must be obtained from that specific, sole source. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such sole-sourced raw materials by active inventory management, relationship management, and alternate source development, when feasible (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components are single-sourced from third parties; third-party supply failures could adversely affect our ability to supply our products”). We monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers, their ability to supply our needs and the market conditions for these raw materials. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial manufacturing and formulation of our products are derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum, and human serum albumin, or HSA. We are investigating screening procedures with respect to certain biological sources and alternatives to them. Raw materials, medical de 19    vices, and components may be subject to contamination and/or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction could adversely impact or disrupt our commercial manufacturing of our products. Joint Ventures and Business Relationships From time to time, we may enter into joint ventures and other business relationships to provide additional development, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities. In addition to our internal R&D efforts, we have acquired certain product and technology rights and have established R&D collaborations to enhance our R&D capabilities and internally developed product pipeline. Our R&D collaborations generally can consist of non-refundable, upfront license fees, R&D and commercial performance milestones, cost sharing, royalties and/or profit sharing. Additionally, these collaborations may include manufacturing and co-promotion arrangements. Our collaboration agreements with third parties are performed on a “best efforts” basis with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success. Kirin Brewery Company, Limited We formed KA, a 50-50 joint venture with Kirin in 1984. KA develops and commercializes certain of our and Kirin’s technologies, which have been transferred to this joint venture. KA has given exclusive licenses to us to manufacture and market: 1) darbepoetin alfa in the United States, all European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries, and certain countries in Central Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East, 2) recombinant human erythropoietin in the United States, and 3) pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. We currently market certain of these products under the brand names EPOGEN® (Epoetin alfa), Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa), Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), and NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim). KA has also given exclusive licenses to Kirin to manufacture and market: 1) darbepoetin alfa in Japan, the People’s Republic of China (“China”), Taiwan, Korea, and certain other countries in Southeast Asia, 2) recombinant human erythropoietin in Japan, and 3) G-CSF and pegfilgrastim in Japan, Taiwan and Korea. Kirin markets recombinant human erythropoietin and G-CSF in China under a separate agreement with KA. Kirin markets its recombinant human erythropoietin product in Japan under the trademark ESPO®. Kirin markets its G-CSF product in its respective territories under the trademark GRAN®. KA has licensed to Johnson & Johnson rights to recombinant human erythropoietin in certain geographic areas of the world (see “— Johnson & Johnson”). Under its agreement with KA, Johnson & Johnson pays a royalty to KA based on sales. KA has also licensed to Roche rights to pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in certain geographic areas of the world. During 2005 certain of our and Kirin’s technologies related to AMG 531 were transferred to KA. In return, KA has given us and Kirin exclusive licenses to manufacture and market AMG 531 in certain territories. KA is currently conducting phase 3 studies related to AMG 531. In connection with our various license agreements with KA, we pay KA royalties based on product sales and also receive payment for conducting certain R&D activities on behalf of KA (See Note 2, “Related party transactions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Johnson & Johnson We granted Johnson & Johnson a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all markets other than dialysis. In the United States, all recombinant human erythropoietin sold by Johnson & Johnson is manufactured by us and sold by Johnson & Johnson under the trademark PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa). PROCRIT® brand Epoetin alfa is identical to EPOGEN® brand Epoetin alfa, which is manufactured and sold by us in the U.S. dialysis market. Pursuant to the license agreement with Johnson & Johnson, we earn a 10% royalty on sales of PROCRIT® by Johnson & Johnson in the United States. 20     Outside the United States, with the exception of China and Japan, Johnson & Johnson was granted rights to manufacture and commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic for all uses under a licensing agreement with KA. With respect to its sales outside of the United States, Johnson & Johnson manufactures and commercializes its own brand of Epoetin alfa which is then sold throughout the world by Johnson & Johnson under various trademarks such as EPREX® and ERYPO®. We are not involved in the manufacture of Epoetin alfa sold by Johnson & Johnson outside of the United States. (See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Johnson & Johnson Matters — Arbitration/Demand for Separate BLA.”) Wyeth Amgen and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL under a co-promotion agreement in the United States and Canada for all approved indications other than for use in oncology. The rights to detail and promote ENBREL in the United States and Canada for oncology indications are reserved to Amgen. The rights to market ENBREL outside of the United States and Canada are reserved to Wyeth. Under the co-promotion agreement, a management committee comprised of equal representation from Wyeth and Amgen is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL including: strategic planning, the approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing, and the establishment of a brand team. The brand team, with equal representation from each party, prepares and implements the annual marketing plan, which includes a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party, and is responsible for all sales activities. Further, pursuant to the co-promotion agreement, Wyeth and Amgen each pay a defined percentage of all selling and marketing expenses approved by the management committee. In addition, we pay Wyeth a percentage of the annual gross profits of ENBREL, which reflect the sharing of manufacturing costs in the United States and Canada attributable to all approved indications for ENBREL on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, we maintain a majority share of ENBREL profits. Under the co-promotion agreement, Wyeth is required to reimburse Amgen for: 1) certain clinical and regulatory expenses we incur in connection with the filing and approval of any new indications for ENBREL in the United States and Canada, excluding oncology and rheumatoid arthritis indications; 2) certain specified patent expenses related to ENBREL; and 3) certain costs, expenses, and liabilities associated with the manufacture, use, or sale of ENBREL in the United States and Canada. We also have a global supply agreement with Wyeth related to the manufacture, supply, inventory, and allocation of supplies of ENBREL. Under this agreement, we and Wyeth share the total worldwide supply of ENBREL produced by Amgen’s Rhode Island manufacturing facilities, BI Pharma’s manufacturing facility in Germany, and Wyeth’s manufacturing facility in Ireland. Abgenix, Inc. In October 2003, Amgen and Abgenix, Inc. (“Abgenix”) amended an existing agreement to jointly develop and commercialize panitumumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody created by Abgenix (see “Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates”). Abgenix is a company specializing in the discovery, development and manufacture of human therapeutic antibodies. Under the amended agreement, we have decision-making authority for the joint development and commercialization of panitumumab, but development and commercialization costs, as well as any potential profits from future sales of panitumumab, are shared equally. We have the right to conduct all future clinical trials. In addition, Abgenix will manufacture clinical and early commercial supplies of panitumumab with our support and assistance. If clinical trials for panitumumab are successful and regulatory approval is received, we would have the primary role in implementing marketing and product launch activities for panitumumab, while Abgenix may participate in co-promotion. 21    In December 2005, we signed a definitive merger agreement under which we will pay shareholders of Abgenix $22.50 in cash per common share for a total value of approximately $2.2 billion and will assume Abgenix’s outstanding debt. The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger on January 19, 2006 and we expect to close the merger, subject to Abgenix shareholder approval, by April 2006. If and when the merger is closed, the terms of the above-noted business relationship will terminate. Government Regulation Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing R&D activities. In order to clinically test, manufacture, and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. In the United States, the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated there under, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the raw materials and components used in the production of, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, and promotion of our products on a product-by-product basis. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves our expenditure of substantial resources and, after approval, such approval remains costly for us to maintain. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an investigational new drug application with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake a three-phase human clinical testing program. In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to determine the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates. In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to assess safety and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of our product candidates. In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to provide sufficient data for the statistically valid proof of safety and efficacy. The time and expense required for us to perform this clinical testing can vary and is substantial. For example, our late-stage product candidate denosumab requires large trials that require substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. Historically, our products have required smaller, shorter trials. We cannot take any action to market any new drug or biologic product in the United States until our appropriate marketing application has been approved by the FDA. Even after we have obtained initial FDA approval, we may be required to conduct further clinical trials and provide additional data on safety and effectiveness and are required to gain clearance for the use of a product as a treatment for indications other than those initially approved. In addition, side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede, or prevent marketing approval. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product’s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. Any adverse event, either before or after marketing approval, can result in product liability claims against us. In addition to regulating and auditing human clinical trials, the FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories, and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of such products prior to providing approval to market a product. If after receiving clearance from the FDA, we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories, and processes following the initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that our equipment, facilities, laboratories, or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations. In the European countries, Canada, and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. Additionally, depending on the type of drug for which  22    approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval in the European countries: mutual recognition and the centralized procedure. These review mechanisms may ultimately lead to approval in all EU countries, but each method grants all participating countries some decision-making authority in product approval. We are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. The federal government has published regulations that identify “safe harbors” or exemptions for certain arrangements that do not violate the anti-kickback statutes. We seek to comply with the safe harbors where possible. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). If the government were to allege against or convict us of violating these laws, there could be a material adverse effect on us, including our stock price. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. Since 1991, we have participated in the Medicaid rebate program established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and under amendments of that law that became effective in 1993. Participation in this program has included extending comparable discounts under the Public Health Service (“PHS”) pharmaceutical pricing program. Under the Medicaid rebate program, we pay a rebate for each unit of our product reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law as a minimum 15.1% of the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) of that product, or if it is greater, the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any customer. The rebate amount also includes an inflation adjustment if AMP increases faster than inflation. The PHS pricing program extends discounts comparable to the Medicaid rebate to a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of poor Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The rebate amount is recomputed each quarter based on our reports of our current AMP and best price for each of our products to the CMS. The terms of our participation in the program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates (and interest, if any), if we were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information. We also make our products available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) of the General Services Administration. Since 1993, as a result of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (the “VHC Act”), federal law has required that product prices for purchases by the Veterans Administration, the Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and the PHS (including the Indian Health Service) be discounted by a minimum of 24% off the AMP to non-federal customers (the non-federal average manufacturer price, “non-FAMP”). Our computation and report of non-FAMP is used in establishing the price, and the accuracy of the reported non-FAMP may be audited by the government under applicable federal procurement laws. Among the remedies available to the government for infractions of these laws is  23    recoupment of any overages paid by FSS users during the audited years. In addition, if we were found to have knowingly reported a false non-FAMP, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the VHC Act provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per item that is incorrect. We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other current and potential future federal, state, or local laws, rules, and/or regulations. Our R&D activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials, and various radioactive compounds. We believe that our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state, or local laws, rules, and/or regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. Our research and manufacturing activities also are conducted in voluntary compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research. Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws, rules, and/or regulations. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval and comply with manufacturing regulations.”) 24     Patents and Trademarks We have filed applications for a number of patents, have been granted patents, or have obtained rights relating to our products and various potential products. Our material patents are set forth in the table below.     Product                           General Subject Matter           Expiration         Epoetin alfa       U.S.       — Process of making erythropoietin       8/15/2012                        — Product claims to erythropoietin       8/20/2013                        — Pharmaceutical compositions of erythropoietin       8/20/2013                        — Cells that make certain levels of erythropoietin       5/26/2015         darbepoetin alfa       Europe(1)       — Glycosylation analogs of erythropoietin proteins       10/12/2010                         — Glycosylation analogs of erythropoietin proteins       8/16/2014         Filgrastim       U.S.       — DNA, vectors, cells and processes relating to recombinant G-CSF       3/7/2006                        — G-CSF polypeptides       12/3/2013                        — Methods of treatment using G-CSF polypeptides       12/10/2013                Europe(1)       — G-CSF DNA Vectors, cells, polypeptides, methods of use and production       8/22/2006         pegfilgrastim       U.S.       — Pegylated G-CSF       10/20/2015                 Europe(1)       — Pegylated G-CSF       2/8/2015         Etanercept       U.S.       — Methods of treating TNF — dependent disease       9/5/2009                        — TNFR proteins and pharmaceutical compositions       9/5/2009                        — TNFR DNA vectors, cells and processes for making proteins       10/23/2012          (1) In some cases these European patents may also be entitled to supplemental protection in one or more countries in Europe and the length of any such extension will vary country by country. There can be no assurance that our patents or licensed patents will afford legal protection against competitors or provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantage. In addition, our patents or licensed patents could be held invalid or unenforceable by a court, or infringed or circumvented by others, or others could obtain patents that we would need to license or circumvent. Competitors or potential competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents, and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to proteins, small molecules, compounds, or processes competitive with ours. Additionally, for certain of our product candidates, competitors, or potential competitors may claim that their existing or pending patents prevent us from commercializing such product candidates in certain territories. Further, when our patents expire, other companies could develop new competitive products to our products. Our near-term European patent expirations could result in new competitive products to our products in Europe. Our principal European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December 12, 2004 and our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expires on August 22, 2006. We believe that after the expiration of each of these patents, other companies could receive approval for and market follow-on or biosimilar products to compete with these products in the EU; presenting additional competition to our products. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.”) While we do not market erythropoietin in Europe as this right belongs to  25    Johnson & Johnson (through KA), we do market Aranesp® in the EU, which competes with Johnson & Johnson’s EPREX® product, Roche’s Neorecormon® product, and others’ erythropoietin products. We cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU. However, based on an announcement by Shire, we expect that the first competing Epoetin alfa product, manufactured by Shire, may appear on the market in the EU in the first half of 2007. Also, we expect that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the EU beginning in late 2006 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval. We also expect that the first biosimilar G-CSF product may be approved as early as mid-2007 and that it would compete with Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. We cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar products would impact future Aranesp®, Neulasta® or NEUPOGEN® sales in the EU. The EU is currently in the process of developing regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. In July 2005, the EMEA, issued clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products including erythropoietins and granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, which guidance recommends that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct fairly extensive pharmacodynamic, toxicological, clinical safety studies and a pharmacovigilance program. In October 2005, the EMEA confirmed that biosimilar products will be approved under a different legal pathway than the one applicable to generics of small molecule drugs. Based on the process and timing outlined by the EMEA, we believe relevant product specific guidelines are likely to be finalized by the first quarter of 2006. However, we cannot predict what final EMEA product specific guidelines will be. In general, we have obtained licenses from various parties which we deem to be necessary or desirable for the manufacture, use or sale of our products. These licenses generally require us to pay royalties to the parties on product sales. In addition, other companies have filed patent applications or have been granted patents in areas of interest to us. There can be no assurance any licenses required under such patents will be available for license on acceptable terms or at all. We are engaged in various legal proceedings relating to certain of our patents (see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”). Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require our staff members, material consultants, scientific advisors, and parties to collaboration and licensing agreements to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, the consulting relationship, or the collaboration or licensing arrangement with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or obtain access to our information. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.”) (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.”) Human Resources As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 16,500 staff members, which includes approximately 100 part-time staff members. Of the total staff members as of December 31, 2005, approximately 6,500 were engaged in R&D, approximately 3,000 were engaged in selling and marketing, approximately 5,100 were engaged in commercial manufacturing activities, and approximately 1,900 were engaged in other activities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue attracting and retaining qualified personnel in sufficient numbers to meet our needs. None of our staff members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our staff relations to be good. We expect to hire additional staff members throughout 2006, primarily in R&D to enable us to advance the pipeline. 26    Executive Officers of the Registrant The executive officers of the Company as of February 2, 2006 are as follows: Mr. Kevin W.

Geographic Area Financial Information For financial information concerning the geographic areas in which we operate, see Note 9, “Segment information — Geographic information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investor Information Financial and other information about us is available on our website (http://www.amgen.com) (This website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained in our website is not intended to be a part of this filing). We make available on our website, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material electronically or otherwise furnishing it to the SEC. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS This report and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, operations, liquidity and stock price materially and adversely. 28     If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific, and factual questions. To date, there has emerged no consistent policy regarding breadth of claims allowed in such companies’ patents. Third parties may challenge, invalidate, or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates, and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For example, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (“Roche”) is developing a pegylated erythropoietin molecule that, according to Roche’s public statements, they expect to bring to the U.S. market despite their acknowledgement of our U.S. erythropoietin patents. On November 8, 2005, we filed a lawsuit against Roche for patent infringement of six of our U.S. patents. This lawsuit is described in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Amgen Inc. v. F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., et al.” For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patents that they may claim prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly, and can preclude or delay commercialization of products. We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in patent litigation. For example, we are currently involved in an ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. (“TKT”) and Aventis with respect to our erythropoietin patents. If we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be: subject to competition and/or significant liabilities; required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology; or required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. We have filed applications for a number of patents and have been granted patents or obtained rights relating to erythropoietin, natural and recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, etanercept, and our other products and potential products. We market our erythropoietin, recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, and etanercept products as EPOGEN® (Epoetin alfa), NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim), Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa), Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), and Enbrel® (etanercept), respectively. With respect to our material patents, we have had a number of G-CSF patent expiries in the United States and one erythropoietin patent expiry in the European Union (“EU”). For additional information on our material patents see “Patents and Trademarks” in “Item 1. Business.” We also have been granted or obtained rights to patents in Europe relating to: erythropoietin; G-CSF; pegfilgrastim (pegylated G-CSF); etanercept; two relating to darbepoetin alfa; and hyperglycosylated erythropoietic proteins. Our principal European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December 12, 2004 and our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expires on August 22, 2006. We believe that after the expiration of each of these patents, other companies could receive approval for and market follow-on or biosimilar products to compete with these products in the EU; presenting additional competition to our products. (See “— Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.”) While we do not market erythropoietin in Europe as this right belongs to Johnson & Johnson (through Kirin Amgen, Inc. (“KA”)), we do market Aranesp® in the EU, which competes with Johnson & Johnson’s EPREX® product, Roche’s Neorecormon® product, and others’ erythropoietin products. We cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU. However, based on an announcement by Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc (“Shire”), we expect that the first competing Epoetin alfa product, manufactured by Shire, may appear on the market in the EU in the first half of 2007. Also, we expect that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the EU beginning in late 2006 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval. We also expect that the first biosimilar G- 29    CSF product may be approved as early as mid-2007 and that it would compete with Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. We cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar products would impact future Aranesp®, Neulasta® or NEUPOGEN® sales in the EU. The EU is currently in the process of developing regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. In July 2005, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products (“EMEA”), issued clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products including erythropoietins and granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, which guidance recommends that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct fairly extensive pharmacodynamic, toxicological, clinical safety studies and a pharmacovigilance program. In October 2005, the EMEA confirmed that biosimilar products will be approved under a different legal pathway than the one applicable to generics of small molecule drugs. Based on the process and timing outlined by the EMEA, we believe relevant product specific guidelines are likely to be finalized by the first quarter of 2006. However, we cannot predict what final EMEA product specific guidelines will be. Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected. Before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials which demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans for the indications sought. The results of these clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain regulatory approval from government authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Clinical trials are experiments conducted using our product candidates in human patients having the diseases or medical conditions we are trying to address. Conducting clinical trials is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims we are seeking. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product candidate, and therefore, we may spend as much as several years completing certain trials. Further, the time within which we can complete our clinical trials depends in large part on the rate of patient enrollment. Patient enrollment is a function of several factors, including the size of the patient population, enrollment criteria, the proximity of the patients to the trial sites, and competition with other clinical trials for eligible patients. As such, there may be limited availability of patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. Delays in planned patient enrollment can result in increased development costs, delays in regulatory approvals and associated delays in product candidates reaching the market. Patients may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects in the course of our clinical trials that may delay or prohibit regulatory approval of our product candidates. Of course, even if we successfully manage our clinical trials, we may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and may not be able to obtain regulatory approval on this basis. In 2006, we are expecting a significant increase in the number, size, duration and complexity of our clinical trials, in particular with respect to denosumab, our late-stage investigational product for osteoporosis, and we expect total research and development expenses to increase by 30-40%. For example, testing denosumab in the osteoporosis setting requires large clinical trials, substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. We expect to start eleven “mega-site” trials (involving 200 or more sites) in 2006 to support denosumab and our other late-stage programs. To execute our clinical trial programs, we need to accelerate the growth of our development organization, implement new management structures and approaches and increase dependence on third-party contract clinical trial providers. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we are planning to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, China, India and some South American countries. We plan to conduct clinical trial activities in these new territories through third-party contract clinical trial providers. 30    If we fail to adequately manage the increasing number, size and complexity of our clinical trials, our clinical trials and corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our product candidates or are unable to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected materially. Our product development efforts may not result in commercial products. We intend to continue an aggressive research and development program. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few research and development projects produce a commercial product. Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development, such as in early human clinical trials, may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: · the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results · the product candidate was not effective in treating a specified condition or illness · the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals · the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use · the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize · other companies or people have or may have proprietary rights to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all · the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics · we and certain of our licensors or partners may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities Several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process, including, but not limited to, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“BDNF”), Megakaryocyte Growth and Development Factor (“MGDF”), and Glial Cell Lined-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“GDNF”). For example, in 1997, we announced the failure of BDNF for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s Disease, because the product candidate, when administered by injection, did not produce acceptable clinical results for a specific use after a phase 3 trial, even though BDNF had progressed successfully through preclinical and earlier clinical trials. In addition, in 1998, we discontinued development of MGDF, a novel platelet growth factor, at the phase 3 trial stage after several people in platelet donation trials developed low platelet counts and neutralizing antibodies. Also, in June 2004, we announced that the phase 2 study of GDNF for the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease did not meet the primary study endpoint upon completion of nine months of the double-blind treatment phase of the study even though a small phase 1 pilot investigator initiated open label study over a three year period appeared to result in improvements for advanced Parkinson’s disease patients. Subsequently, in the fall of 2004 we discontinued clinical development of GDNF in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease after several patients in the phase 2 study developed neutralizing antibodies and new preclinical data showed that GDNF caused irreversible damage to the area of the brain critical to movement control and coordination. On February 11, 2005, we confirmed our previous decision to halt clinical trials and, as a part of that decision and based on thorough scientific review, we also concluded that we will not provide GDNF to the 48 patients who participated in clinical trials that were terminated in the fall of 2004. Of course, there may be other factors that prevent us from marketing a product. We cannot guarantee we will be able to produce or manufacture commercially successful products. (See “— Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing may limit supply of our products and limit our  31    product sales.”, “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval and comply with manufacturing regulations.” and “— Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.”) Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products. In the United States, dialysis providers are primarily reimbursed for EPOGEN® by the federal government through the End Stage Renal Disease Program (“ESRD Program”) of Medicare. The ESRD Program reimburses approved providers for 80% of allowed dialysis costs; the remainder is paid by other sources, including patients, state Medicaid programs, private insurance, and to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. The ESRD Program reimbursement rate is established by federal law and is monitored and implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). Most patients receiving Aranesp®, Neulasta®, and NEUPOGEN® for approved indications are covered by both government and private payer health care programs. Beginning in 2006, ENBREL and Sensipar® are eligible for coverage from the U.S. government under Medicare Part D. Therefore, sales of all of our principal products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including governments and private insurance plans. Generally, worldwide use of our products may be affected by cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers on health care providers in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce health care expenditures. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act (or the “Medicare Modernization Act” (“MMA”)) was enacted into law in December 2003 and became effective January 1, 2005. Changes resulting from the MMA, which lowered reimbursement for our products, could negatively affect product sales of some of our marketed products. However in 2005, we believe that our product sales were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the MMA. We believe this was, in part, due to the effects of CMS’s oncology demonstration project (the “2005 Demonstration Project”) on sales of our products used in supportive cancer care, especially Aranesp®. Furthermore, we believe this was also, in part, due to increased reimbursement rates to physicians from CMS for services associated with drug administration. The 2005 Demonstration Project, which provided financial incentives to physicians for collecting and reporting oncology patient survey data, expired on December 31, 2005. In November 2005, CMS announced a new demonstration project (the “2006 Demonstration Project”) that uses different criteria for how patients with cancer are evaluated and treated and that is targeted at approximately half of the funding originally targeted for the 2005 Demonstration Project. The final rule for the 2006 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Rule issued in November 2005 reduced payments for physician services in 2006 by approximately 4.4% on average. However, recently passed legislation will eliminate this reduction for 2006. Because we cannot accurately predict the impact of any such changes on how, or under what circumstances, healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products, we cannot estimate the full impact of the MMA on our business. However, we believe that it is not likely to be significant to our business in 2006. The main components of the MMA that affect our currently marketed products are as follows: · Through 2004, the Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”) mechanism was the basis of Medicare Part B payment for covered outpatient drugs and biologics. Effective January 1, 2005, in the physician clinic setting, Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® are being reimbursed under a Medicare Part B payment methodology that reimburses each product at 106% of its “average sales price” (“ASP”) (sometimes referred to as “ASP+6%”). ASP is calculated by the manufacturer based on a statutorily defined formula and submitted to CMS. A product’s ASP is calculated on a quarterly basis and therefore may change each quarter. The ASP in effect for a given quarter (the “Current  32    Period”) is based upon certain historical sales and sales incentive data covering a statutorily defined period of time preceding the Current Period. For example, the ASP for Aranesp® that we submit for the second quarter of 2006 will be based on certain historical sales and sales incentive data for Aranesp® from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005. CMS publishes the ASPs for products in advance of the quarter in which they go into effect. The 2005 reimbursement rates for Aranesp® and Neulasta® (calculated at 106% of the ASPs) were lower than their respective 2004 reimbursement rates. Although the ASPs for Aranesp® and Neulasta® have trended downward during 2005, they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2005. · Per the MMA, physicians in the physician clinic setting will have the choice between purchasing and billing for drugs under the ASP+6% system or obtaining drugs from vendors selected by CMS under the “competitive acquisition program” (“CAP”) starting in 2006. Physicians who select to obtain drugs from CAP will no longer purchase or obtain reimbursement directly for such drugs. CMS issued a final rule related to CAP in November 2005. Based on this final rule, the election period for 2006 will occur between April 3 and May 15, 2006 for participation from July 1 through December 31, 2006; the first drug deliveries through the CAP will occur in July 2006. Based on the final rule for CAP, we do not anticipate widespread adoption of this program initially. Nevertheless, because we cannot fully predict how many physicians will select to obtain drugs from CAP, we cannot predict the full impact of the CAP on our business. However, pursuant to the final rule, discounts to CAP vendors are excluded from the calculation of ASPs and therefore do not have the potential to impact the ASPs for our products that would be available through the CAP. · Medicare’s hospital outpatient prospective payment system (“OPPS”), which determines payment rates for specified covered outpatient drugs and biologics in the hospital outpatient setting, utilized AWP as the basis for reimbursement in 2005. CMS’ 2005 reimbursement rate, as in 2003 and 2004, continued the application of an “equitable adjustment” such that the 2005 Aranesp® reimbursement rate was based on the AWP of PROCRIT®. For 2005, the reimbursement rate for Aranesp® was 83% of the AWP for PROCRIT®, down from 88% of the AWP for PROCRIT® in 2004, with a dose conversion ratio of 330 U PROCRIT® to 1 mcg Aranesp®, the same ratio as 2004. Effective January 1, 2006, the OPPS system changed from an AWP based reimbursement system to a system based on ASP. This change affects Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® when administered in the hospital outpatient setting. In November 2005, CMS released its final OPPS rule for 2006. This final rule bases reimbursement for non-pass through products such as Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® on an ASP+6% using the same payment amounts as used in the physician clinic setting and does not apply an “equitable adjustment” to tie the reimbursement rate for Aranesp® to PROCRIT® using a dose conversion ratio. In the final rule, CMS noted that it reserves the right to apply “equitable adjustment” to the Aranesp® reimbursement rate calculation methodology in years after 2006. · Pursuant to final rules issued by CMS on November 3, 2004, Medicare reimbursement for EPOGEN® used in the dialysis setting for calendar year 2005 changed from the previous rate in 2004 of $10 per 1,000 Units to $9.76 per 1,000 Units, in 2005, a rate based upon an average acquisition cost for 2003 determined by the Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) and adjusted for price inflation based on the Producer Price Index for pharmaceutical products. Pursuant to the CMS final rules, the difference between the 2004 reimbursement rates for all drugs separately billed outside the dialysis composite rate (including EPOGEN®) and the 2005 reimbursement rates for such drugs was added to the composite rate that dialysis providers receive for dialysis treatment. In November 2005, CMS released the 2006 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Rule. In the final rule, CMS stated that EPOGEN® and separately billed ESRD drugs will be reimbursable at ASP+6% in both freestanding and hospital-based dialysis centers. This final rule establishes the payment mechanism for separately reimbursed dialysis drugs in both freestanding and hospital- 33    based dialysis centers, including EPOGEN® and Aranesp®, at ASP+6% using the same payment amounts used in the physician clinic setting and calculated quarterly in the same manner as described above for our products under the Medicare Part B payment methodology. Based on this final rule, we expect that the reimbursement rate for EPOGEN® will decrease for 2006 compared to 2005. Because we cannot accurately predict the extent to which this reduced reimbursement will impact how, or under what circumstances, healthcare providers will prescribe or administer EPOGEN®, we cannot estimate the full impact of the reduced reimbursement rate on our EPOGEN® product sales. However, we believe that it is not likely to be significant in 2006. In addition, on November 9, 2005, CMS released a final revision to the Hematocrit Measurement Audit Program Memorandum (“HMA-PM”), a Medicare payment review mechanism used by CMS to audit EPOGEN® and Aranesp® (when used in dialysis) utilization and appropriate hematocrit outcomes of dialysis patients. The new policy, Claims Monitoring Policy: Erythropoietin/darbepoetin alfa usage for beneficiaries with end stage renal disease (“Claims Monitoring Policy”), will be effective April 1, 2006. The final Claims Monitoring Policy provides that if a patient’s hemoglobin is greater than 13 grams per deciliter, providers are instructed to reduce the patient’s EPOGEN® and Aranesp® dose by twenty-five percent. If the provider does not reduce the patient’s EPOGEN® and Aranesp® dose and there is no medical documentation to support the higher dosage, reimbursement will be reduced to the level it would have been had the provider reduced dosage by twenty-five percent. Based on our preliminary evaluation, we do not expect the new Claims Monitoring Policy to have a negative impact on EPOGEN® and Aranesp® sales and given the importance of EPOGEN® and Aranesp® for maintaining the quality of care for dialysis patients, we do not expect that the new policy will substantially impact the utilization of EPOGEN® and Aranesp®. However, we are currently in the process of further evaluating the new Claims Monitoring Policy. As a result, we cannot predict the potential full impact of this final guidance on our business. If, and when, reimbursement rates or availability for our marketed products changes adversely or if we fail to obtain adequate reimbursement for our current or future products, health care providers may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them, which could reduce the use of our products or cause us to reduce the price of our products. This could result in lower product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations. For example, the use of EPOGEN® in the United States in connection with treatment for end stage renal disease is funded primarily by the U.S. federal government. In early 1997, CMS, formerly known as Healthcare Financing Administration (“HCFA”), instituted a reimbursement change for EPOGEN®, which materially and adversely affected our EPOGEN® sales until the policies were revised. Also, we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in the United States, Europe, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products, which may adversely impact product sales. Further, when a new therapeutic product is approved, the governmental and/or private coverage and reimbursement for that product is uncertain. We cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for our approved products or product candidates, including those at a late stage of development, and current reimbursement policies for marketed products may change at any time. Sales of all our products are and will be affected by government and private payer reimbursement policies. Reduction in reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and results of operations. 34     Certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components are single-sourced from third parties; third-party supply failures could adversely affect our ability to supply our products. Certain raw materials necessary for commercial manufacturing and formulation of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Also, certain medical devices and components necessary for formulation, fill, and finish of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Certain of these raw materials, medical devices, and components are the proprietary products of these unaffiliated third-party suppliers and, in some cases, such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with the FDA so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the FDA approved that other supplier. We would be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices, or components for an indeterminate period of time if these third-party single-source suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials or products to us for any reason, including due to regulatory requirements or action, due to adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier, and/or due to unexpected demand, labor shortages or disputes. We would also be unable to obtain these materials, devices and components for an indeterminate period of time if such supply was subsequently found to not be in compliance with our quality standards or resulted in quality failures or product contamination and/or recall when used to manufacture, formulate, fill, or finish our products. These events could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. For example, we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill, and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility without impact on our ability to supply these products. However, we may experience the shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial manufacturing and the formulation of our products are derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin, or HSA. We are investigating alternatives to certain biological sources as such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. Also, some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. A material shortage, contamination, recall, and/or restriction of the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt our commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. This could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval and comply with manufacturing regulations. We and certain of our licensors and partners conduct research, preclinical testing, and clinical trials for our product candidates. In addition, we manufacture and contract manufacture and certain of our licensors and partners manufacture our product candidates. We also manufacture and contract manufacture, price, sell, distribute, and market or co-market our products for their approved indications. These activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, such as the FDA and CMS, as well as in foreign countries, including European countries, Canada, Australia and Japan. Currently, we are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from those countries’ regulatory authorities before we can manufacture (or have our third-party manufacturers produce), market and sell our products in those countries. In our experience, obtaining regulatory approval is costly and takes many years, and after it is obtained, remains costly to maintain. (See “— Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.”) 35    The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to terminate clinical trials, require additional testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval, require changes in labeling of our products, and mandate product withdrawals. Substantially all of our marketed products are currently approved in the United States and most are approved in Europe and in other foreign countries for specific uses. However, later discovery of unknown problems with our products could result in restrictions on the sale or use of such products, including potential withdrawal of the product from the market. If new medical data suggests an unacceptable safety risk or previously unidentified side-effects, we may voluntarily withdraw, or regulatory authorities may mandate the withdrawal of, such product from the market for some period or permanently. Further, regulatory agencies could change existing, or promulgate new, regulations at any time which may affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our existing or future products or require significant additional costs to obtain or maintain such approvals. We currently manufacture and market all our approved principal products, and we plan to manufacture and market many of our potential products. (See “— Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.” and “— We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.”) Even though we have obtained regulatory approval for our marketed products, these products and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, ENBREL is manufactured both by us at our Rhode Island manufacturing facilities and by third-party contract manufacturers, including Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG (“BI Pharma”). Formulation, fill, and finish of bulk product produced at our Rhode Island manufacturing facilities is performed by us and third-party service providers and formulation, fill, and finish of bulk product manufactured at our other facilities that is currently solely performed by us may also be performed by us and third-party service providers in the future. The third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers are also subject to FDA regulatory authority. (See “— Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.”) In addition, later discovery of unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes or those of our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers could result in restrictions on the sale, manufacture, or use of such products, including potential withdrawal of the products from the market. For example, we have conducted a voluntary wholesaler recall of a limited number of lots of ENBREL as a result of a small number of reports of missing, detached or loose rubber caps on the needle-less syringe filled with diluent liquid by a third-party contract manufacturer and packaged with the vials of ENBREL. Although there have been no observable adverse event trends associated with the reports of missing detached or loose rubber caps, we may experience the same or other problems in the future resulting in broader product recalls or adverse event trends. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend, or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing or selling our marketed products until we or our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. In addition, if regulatory authorities determine that we or our licensor or partner conducting research and development activities on our behalf have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate, then they may not approve the product candidate and we will not be able to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. We formulate, fill, and finish substantially all our products at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at this facility, we may not be able to supply these products. We currently perform all of the formulation, fill, and finish for EPOGEN®, Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® and some formulation, fill, and finish operations for ENBREL at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. Our global supply of these products is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of this facility. Additionally, to keep up with the growing demand for  36    our products, we are operating this facility at nearly full production capacity. Power failures, the breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, or failures to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of the FDA, contamination or shortages of components used in the formulation, fill, and finish of our products, among others, could adversely affect our formulation, fill, and finish operations. For example, this facility in Puerto Rico has experienced manufacturing component shortages and has had evidence of adverse trends in the microbial bioburden of the production environment that has reduced the production output. Although these experiences in Puerto Rico have not impacted our ability to supply product in the past, the same or other problems may result in our being unable to supply these products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. Although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against certain business interruption losses, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. The extent of the coverage of our insurance could limit our ability to mitigate for lost sales and could result in such losses adversely affecting our product sales and operating results materially. Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. We currently manufacture and market all our principal products, and we plan to manufacture and market many of our potential products. Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. (See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval and comply with manufacturing regulations.”) Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products is impacted by many manufacturing variables, such as availability of raw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier, facility capacity, the timing and actual number of production runs, production success rates, bulk drug yields, and the timing and outcome of product quality testing. If we have problems in one or more of these or other manufacturing variables, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. For example, in the second quarter of 2002, the prior co-marketers with respect to ENBREL experienced a brief period where no ENBREL was available to fill patient prescriptions, primarily due to variation in the expected production yield from BI Pharma, our primary third-party manufacturer of ENBREL. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients, physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, and sales of our products will be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales and results of operations. We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our bulk supply and the formulation, fill, and finish of ENBREL. We currently produce a substantial portion of annual ENBREL supply at our Rhode Island manufacturing facilities. However, we also depend on third parties for a significant portion of our ENBREL bulk supply as well as for some of the formulation, fill, and finish of ENBREL that we manufacture. BI Pharma is our third-party manufacturer of ENBREL bulk drug; accordingly, our U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL is currently significantly dependent on BI Pharma’s production schedule for ENBREL. We would be unable to produce ENBREL in sufficient quantities to substantially offset shortages in BI Pharma’s scheduled production if BI Pharma or other third-party manufacturers used for the formulation, fill, and finish of ENBREL bulk drug were to cease or interrupt production or services or otherwise fail to supply materials, products, or services to us for any reason, including due to labor shortages or disputes, regulatory requirements or action, or contamination of product lots or product recalls. This in turn could materially reduce our ability to satisfy demand for ENBREL, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Among the factors that could affect our actual supply of ENBREL at any time in 37    clude, without limitation, is BI Pharma’s and the Rhode Island facilities’ bulk drug production scheduling. For example, BI Pharma does not produce ENBREL continuously; rather, it produces the bulk drug substance through a series of periodic campaigns throughout the year. Our Rhode Island manufacturing facilities are currently dedicated to ENBREL production. The amount of commercial inventory available to us at any time depends on a variety of factors, including the timing and actual number of BI Pharma’s production runs, the actual number of runs at our Rhode Island manufacturing facilities, and, for either the Rhode Island or BI Pharma facilities, the level of production yields and success rates, the timing and outcome of product quality testing, and the amount of formulation, fill, and finish capacity. We are dependent on third parties for some formulation, fill, and finish of ENBREL bulk drug substance manufactured at our Rhode Island facilities. If third-party formulation, fill, and finish manufacturers are unable to provide sufficient capacity or are otherwise unable to provide services to us, then supply of ENBREL could be adversely affected materially. Under a collaboration and global supply agreement, we and Wyeth share the total worldwide supply of ENBREL produced by Amgen’s Rhode Island manufacturing facilities, BI Pharma’s manufacturing facility in Germany and Wyeth’s manufacturing facility in Ireland. Our ENBREL supply forecasts rely on certain assumptions of how much ENBREL each of these manufacturing facilities is expected to produce. If any of these manufacturing facilities are unable to produce in accordance with our or Wyeth’s expectations, the worldwide supply of ENBREL could be adversely affected materially. In such cases, we may be required to allocate supply for Wyeth’s benefit. To the extent that there is a shortfall in worldwide production expectations, our supply of ENBREL could be adversely affected. We have grown rapidly, and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted. We have had an aggressive growth plan that has included substantial and increasing investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and facilities. We plan to continue to grow and our plan has a number of risks, some of which we cannot completely control. For example: · we need to generate higher revenues to cover a higher level of operating expenses, and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control · we need to attract and retain highly qualified management, scientific, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel, including hiring of approximately 1,000 new staff into our research and development organizations in 2006 · we will need to assimilate new staff members and we will need to manage complexities associated with a larger, faster growing and geographically diverse organization · we will need to significantly expand our clinical development resources to manage and execute increasingly larger and more complex clinical trials · we will need to significantly expand our sales and marketing resources to launch a number of late-stage product candidates close in time · we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing capacity for both commercial and clinical supply · we will need to start up and operate a number of new manufacturing facilities and enter into and manage new third-party contract manufacturing arrangements, which may result in temporary inefficiencies and higher cost of goods · we are implementing an enterprise resource planning system to support our increasingly complex business and business processes and such implementation carries substantial operations risk, including loss of data or information, unanticipated increases in costs, disruption of operations or business interruption 38    Of course, there may be other risks and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully manage these or other risks. If we fail to manage our growth in these ways or others, such failure could result in a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. For example, ENBREL competes in certain circumstances with products marketed by Centocor, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Abbott Laboratories, Biogen IDEC Inc., Genentech, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Novartis Corp., and Sanofi-Aventis, as well as the generic drug methotrexate, and may face competition from other potential therapies being developed. Additionally, Aranesp® competes with products marketed by Johnson & Johnson in the United States and the EU and with products marketed by Roche in the EU. Also, Aranesp® may face competition in the EU from another Epoetin alfa product produced by Shire in the first half of 2007. Aranesp® and EPOGEN® may also face competition from Roche’s pegylated erythropoietin molecule that, according to Roche’s public statements, they expect to bring to the U.S. market despite their acknowledgement of our U.S. erythropoietin patents. (See “— If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.”) Further, if our currently marketed products are approved for new uses, or if we sell new products, we may face new, additional competition that we do not face today. Our principal European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December 12, 2004 and our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expires on August 22, 2006. We believe that after the expiration of each of these patents, other companies could receive approval for and market biosimilar products to compete with our products in the EU, presenting additional competition to our products. While we do not market erythropoietin in Europe as this right belongs to Johnson & Johnson (through KA), we do market Aranesp® in the EU, which competes with Johnson & Johnson’s EPREX® product, Roche’s Neorecormon® product and others’ erythropoietin products. We cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU. However, we believe that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the EU beginning in late 2006 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval. We also expect that the first biosimilar G-CSF product may be approved as early as mid-2007 and that it would compete with Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. We cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar products would impact future Aranesp®, Neulasta® or NEUPOGEN® sales in the EU. Our products may compete against products that have lower prices, superior performance, are easier to administer, or that are otherwise competitive with our products. Our inability to compete effectively could adversely affect product sales materially. The EU is currently in the process of developing regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. In July 2005, the EMEA issued clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products including erythropoietins and granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, which guidance recommends that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct fairly extensive pharmacodynamic, toxicological, clinical safety studies and a pharmacovigilance program. In October 2005, the EMEA confirmed that biosimilar products will be approved under a different legal pathway than the one applicable to generics of small molecule drugs. Based on the process and timing outlined by the EMEA, we believe relevant product specific guidelines are likely to be finalized by the first quarter of 2006. However, we cannot predict what the final EMEA product specific guidelines will be. Certain of our competitors, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, market products or are actively engaged in research and development in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. In the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs approved for other indications that may be approved for the same indications as those of our products, and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. 39     Large pharmaceutical corporations may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and human resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. These resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop, and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. Business combinations among our competitors may also increase competition and the resources available to our competitors. Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of freestanding dialysis clinic businesses may negatively impact our bargaining power and profit margins. A significant portion of our product sales are made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and McKesson Corporation. Sales to these three customers aggregated approximately 94% of total U.S. product sales in 2005. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of these products, EPOGEN®, is primarily sold to independent freestanding dialysis clinics, which have recently experienced significant consolidation. Three of these freestanding dialysis clinics, DaVita Inc., Fresenius Medical Care North America, Inc., and Renal Care Group, Inc., account for approximately 70% of all EPOGEN® sales in the freestanding dialysis clinic setting. This concentration and consolidation has increased these entities’ purchasing leverage and may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products or fees for other services, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margins. The results of these developments may have a material adverse effect on our product sales and results of operations. Our marketing of ENBREL will be dependent in part upon Wyeth. Under a co-promotion agreement, we and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL in the United States and Canada. A management committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from us and Wyeth is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL including strategic planning, the approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing, and the establishment of a brand team. The brand team, with equal representation from us and Wyeth, prepares and implements the annual marketing plan, which includes a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party, and is responsible for all sales activities. If Wyeth fails to market ENBREL effectively or if we and Wyeth fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, our sales of ENBREL may be adversely affected materially. Our business may be impacted by government investigations or litigation. We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to various patent matters, government investigations, our business operations, government requests for information, and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Matters required to be disclosed by us are set forth in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and are updated as required in subsequently filed Form 10-Qs. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that affects how we operate our business. Consequently, it is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (in the case of monetary damages, in the period in which such damages are incurred). The federal government, state governments and private payers are investigating, and many have filed actions against, numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Amgen and Immunex Corporation, now a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, alleging that the reporting of prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted in false and overstated AWP, which in turn is alleged to have improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by Medicare beneficiaries, insurers, state Medicaid programs, medical plans and other payers to health care providers who prescribed and administered those products. A number of these actions have been brought against us and/or Immunex. Additionally, a number of states have pending in 40    vestigations regarding our Medicaid drug pricing practices and the U.S. Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services have requested that Immunex produce documents relating to pricing issues. Further, certain state government entity plaintiffs in some of these AWP cases are also alleging that companies, including ours, are not reporting their “best price” to the states under the Medicaid program. These cases and investigations are described in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Average Wholesale Price Litigation”, and are updated as required in subsequent Form 10-Qs. Other states and agencies could initiate investigations of our pricing practices. A decision adverse to our interests on these actions and/or investigations could result in substantial economic damages and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such liabilities are incurred. We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims. Product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management’s attention, and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Amgen and Immunex have been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain company products. We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market. If we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our products, and changes to or re-approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required, any of which could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. After any of our products are approved for commercial use, we or regulatory bodies could decide, and have in the past decided, that changes to our product labeling are required. Label changes may be necessary for a number of reasons, including: the identification of actual or theoretical safety or efficacy concerns by regulatory agencies; the discovery of significant problems with a similar product that implicates an entire class of products or subsequent concerns about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying the label. Any significant concerns raised about the safety or efficacy of our products could also result in the need to reformulate those products, to conduct additional clinical trials, to make changes to our manufacturing processes, or to seek re-approval of our manufacturing facilities. Significant concerns about the safety and effectiveness of a product could ultimately lead to the revocation of its marketing approval. The revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above could be required even if there is no clearly established connection between the product and the safety or efficacy concerns that have been raised. The revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. (See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval and comply with manufacturing regulations.”) Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to the health care and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration, and use of related therapies. Organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products. Recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients and health care providers could result in decreased use of our products. For example, we understand that the Agency for Healthcare Re 41    search and Quality (“AHRQ”) is currently preparing a report on erythropoietic stimulating proteins used in cancer treatment. To the extent that the report makes recommendations on the use of Aranesp®, use of this product could be affected. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use of our products could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Our stock price is volatile, which could adversely affect your investment. Our stock price, like that of other biotechnology companies, is volatile. For example, in the fifty-two weeks prior to December 31, 2005, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a high of $86.17 per share to a low of $57.20 per share. Our stock price may be affected by a number of factors, such as: · changes in reimbursement policies or medical practices · adverse developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products · actual or anticipated clinical trial results · actual or anticipated product supply constraints · product development or other business announcements by us or our competitors · regulatory matters or actions · announcements in the scientific and research community · intellectual property and legal matters · broader economic, industry and market trends unrelated to our performance · failure to complete the Abgenix, Inc. (“Abgenix”) acquisition In addition, if our revenues, earnings or other financial results in any period fail to meet the investment community’s expectations, there could be an immediate adverse impact on our stock price. Our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations. The development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing, and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the United States and to extensive regulation in foreign countries. (See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval and comply with manufacturing regulations.” and “— Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.” and “— We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.”) While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe to be current best practices, we cannot assure you that we or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws or all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations and/or laws a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, including withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs, or other sanctions or litigation. 42    Our revenues may fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause financial results to be below expectations. Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. In budgeting our operating expenses for the foreseeable future, we assume that revenues will continue to grow; however, some of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term. Because of this, even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period’s results to be below our expectations or projections. A revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors, some of which we cannot control. For example, we may face: · changes in the government’s or private payers’ reimbursement policies for our products · inability to maintain regulatory approval of marketed products or manufacturing facilities · changes in our product pricing strategies · lower than expected demand for our products · inability to provide adequate supply of our products · changes in wholesaler buying patterns · increased competition from new or existing products · fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates Of course, there may be other factors that affect our revenues in any given period. Similarly if investors or the investment community are uncertain about our financial performance for a given period, our stock price could also be adversely impacted. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our merger with Abgenix, Inc. On December 14, 2005, we announced that we had signed a definitive merger agreement under which we would acquire Abgenix for approximately $2.2 billion in cash plus the assumption of debt. The acquisition will provide us with full ownership of panitumumab and eliminate a tiered royalty on denosumab, two of our most important advanced pipeline products, as well as provide us with Abgenix’s manufacturing plant. The success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities from integrating the businesses. In particular, this will require the successful regulatory approval and commercial launch of panitumumab along with production of panitumumab at Abgenix’s manufacturing plant. The integration of two independent companies is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. In addition, even if we are able to successfully integrate Abgenix’s operations, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities that we expect to result from the merger, or we may not achieve the expected benefits within the anticipated time frame. Further, the benefits from the merger may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the two companies. We cannot assure you that the integration of Abgenix with us will result in the realization of the full post-merger benefits anticipated by us. Our failure to achieve these benefits could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. Continual manufacturing process improvement efforts may result in the carrying value of certain existing manufacturing facilities or other assets becoming impaired. In connection with our ongoing process improvement activities associated with products we manufacture, we continually invest in our various manufacturing practices and related processes with the objective of increasing production yields and success rates to gain increased cost efficiencies and capacity utilization. Depending on the timing and outcomes of these efforts and our other estimates and assumptions regarding future product sales, the carrying value of certain manufacturing facilities or other assets may not be fully recoverable and could result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value at the time that such effects are identified. The potential recognition of impairment in the carrying value, if any, could have a material and adverse affect on our results of operations. 43    Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
