Each holder of common stock of record as of November 5, 2007 received one additional share of common stock. The additional shares of common stock were distributed on November 26, 2007. All share and per share data (except par value) in this Form 10-K have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock split for all periods presented.  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  During 2007, we operated primarily through three business segments: products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”) and products for production animal health, which we refer to as the Production Animal Segment (“PAS”). We also operate two smaller segments that comprise products for dairy quality, which we refer to as Dairy, and products for the human medical diagnostic market, which we refer to as OPTI Medical. Financial information about the Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments are combined and presented in an “Other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. We added the OPTI Medical operating segment in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc in January 2007. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our segments, including geographic information, and about our product and service categories.  COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP  Instruments and Consumables  We currently market an integrated and highly flexible suite of in-house laboratory analyzers for use in veterinary practices that we refer to as the IDEXX VetLab® suite of analyzers. The IDEXX VetLab® Suite includes several instrument systems, as well as associated proprietary consumable products that are described below:  Blood and Urine Chemistry. Our VetTest® Chemistry Analyzer is used to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine in order to assist the veterinarian in diagnosing physiologic conditions. Twenty-six separate tests can be performed on the VetTest® Chemistry Analyzer and additional parameters can be calculated. Blood tests commonly run include glucose, alkaline phosphatase, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (“BUN”) and total protein. The VetTest® Chemistry Analyzer also runs tests for urine protein/urine creatinine ratio, which assists in the detection of early renal disease. Tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels, such as the Preanesthetic Panel, the General Health Profile, the Equine Health Panel, the Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (“NSAID”) Monitoring Panel, the Avian Health Profile, the Quality Control Panel and the Diagnostic Health Profile.  Our VetLyte® Analyzer measures three electrolytes—sodium, potassium and chloride—to aid in evaluating acid-base and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration.  Our VetStat® Analyzer measures electrolytes, blood gases, glucose and ionized calcium, and calculates other parameters, such as bicarbonate and anion gap. These measurements aid veterinarians in evaluating fluid therapy choices and measuring respiratory function. The VetStat® Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer runs single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes.  We purchase all of the reagents used in the VetTest® Chemistry Analyzer (“dry chemistry slides” or “VetTest® slides”) from Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”), a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. See the section below within Item I, “Production and Supply.” In October 2003, we entered into an agreement with Ortho under which we are developing a next-generation chemistry analyzer for the veterinary market, named Catalyst Dx™, which is based primarily on Ortho’s dry-slide technology. Ortho will provide slide consumables used in both the VetTest® Chemistry Analyzer and the new analyzer, Catalyst Dx™, through 2025. Catalyst Dx™ will provide significantly improved throughput, ease of use and menu, including the ability to run electrolytes. We expect Catalyst Dx™ to be commercially available in early 2008 and we will be manufacturing this instrument. We also expect to be selling and supporting VetTest® for the foreseeable future.   4    Table of Contents  Chemistry reagent sales for use in our installed base of chemistry analyzers provide the majority of consumables volumes and revenues generated from our installed base of IDEXX VetLab® equipment.  Hematology. We sell two hematology analyzers: the LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzer, which uses laser-flow cytometry technology to analyze components of blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets; and the VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzer.  Quantitative Immunoassay Testing. The IDEXX SNAP® Reader allows the veterinarian to obtain quantitative measurements of total thyroxine (“T4”), cortisol and bile acids, which assist in the evaluation of thyroid, adrenal and liver function.  We have under development and plan to launch a new quantitative immunoassay platform called SNAPshot Dx™ in early 2008. This product will replace the IDEXX SNAP® Reader. SNAPshot Dx™ is designed to significantly improve ease of use, throughput and menu. We will manufacture this instrument and its consumables internally.  Blood Coagulation. In late 2007 we introduced the Coag Dx™ Analyzer, which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders.  Urinalysis. Our IDEXX VetLab® UA™ Urinalysis Analyzer provides rapid, semi-quantitative urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use.  IDEXX VetLab® Station. We sell IDEXX VetLab® Station (“IVLS”) as an integral component of the LaserCyte system (and Catalyst Dx™ following launch) and also as a standalone hardware platform. In both cases, IVLS physically connects and integrates all the IDEXX VetLab® equipment and provides a laboratory information management system capability. IVLS includes a user interface to run the individual equipment; generates one integrated patient report; stores, retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data, including SNAP® test results; and connects to practice information management systems, including IDEXX Cornerstone® and Better Choice® systems, as well as a wide variety of third-party systems.  Rapid Assays  We provide a broad range of single-use, handheld test kits under the SNAP® name that allow quick, accurate and convenient test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions. These products enable veterinarians to provide improved service to animal owners by delivering test results and a diagnosis at the time of the patient visit, allowing the veterinarian to initiate therapy or prevention, if required. These kits work without the use of instrumentation.  Our principal single-use tests include canine combination parasite tests called SNAP® 3Dx® , which tests simultaneously for Lyme disease, Ehrlichia canis and heartworm, and SNAP®4Dx®, which additionally tests for Anaplasma phagocytophilum; a canine heartworm-only test; canine tests for parvovirus and pancreatitis; a feline combination test, the SNAP® Combo FIV antibody/FeLV antigen test, which enables veterinarians to test simultaneously for feline immunodeficiency virus (“FIV”) (which is similar to the human AIDS virus) and feline leukemia virus (“FeLV”); a feline test for FeLV only; and canine and feline tests for Giardia, a parasitic disease. Sales of canine parasite tests, including the heartworm only test, are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice.  In addition to our single-use tests, we sell a line of microwell-based test kits, under the PetChek® name, that are used by larger clinics and laboratories to test multiple samples. PetChek® tests offer accuracy, ease of use and cost advantages to high-volume customers. We currently sell PetChek® tests for canine heartworm disease, FIV, and FeLV.  Veterinary Reference Laboratory and Consulting Services  We offer commercial veterinary reference laboratory and consulting services to veterinarians in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan, and South Africa. Veterinarians use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities. Our laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in production and companion animals.   5    Table of Contents  Additionally, we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine and advisory services, including cardiology, radiology, internal medicine and ultrasound consulting. These services permit veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the Internet from the veterinarians’ offices.  Practice Information Systems and Digital Radiography  Practice Information Systems and Services. We develop, market and sell practice information systems, including hardware and software that run key functions of veterinary clinics, including patient electronic health records management, scheduling (including boarding and grooming), billing, and inventory management. Our principal system is the Cornerstone® system. We also provide software and hardware support to our practice information system customers, and related supplies and services to veterinary practice information system users in general, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues for this product line from ongoing service contracts.  Digital Radiography Systems and Services. Our digital radiography systems capture radiograph images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film. Use of digital radiography systems eliminates the need for the film and processor, hazardous chemicals and darkroom required for the production of film images, and provides for image manipulation and enhancement through contrast management. We market and sell three digital radiography systems, the IDEXX-DR™ 1417 and the IDEXX-CR™ 1417 systems for use in the small animal (e.g., dog and cat) veterinary hospital, and the IDEXX EquiView® DR system for use as a portable unit in ambulatory veterinary practices, such as equine practices. Our digital radiography systems use IDEXX-PACS™ picture archiving and communication system (“PACS”) software for the viewing, manipulation, management, storage and retrieval of the digital images generated by the digital capture plate. The IDEXX-PACS™ software also permits images from our digital radiography systems to be integrated into patients’ medical records in the Cornerstone® system, as well as transferred to other practice information management systems.  Pharmaceutical Products  We develop and commercialize pharmaceuticals for the veterinary market. We currently market and sell four pharmaceutical products: PZI VET®, an insulin product for the treatment of diabetic cats; Acarexx® (0.01% ivermectin) otic suspension for the treatment of ear mites in cats; SURPASS® (1% diclofenac sodium), a topical, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for equine use; and Navigator® (32% nitazoxanide) Antiprotozoal Oral Paste, a treatment for equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (“EPM”). See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – We May be Required to Discontinue Sales of One of Our Veterinary Pharmaceutical Products.”  WATER  We offer a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological analytes in water.  Our Colilert®, Colilert®-18 and Colisure® tests simultaneously detect total coliforms and E. coli in water. These organisms are broadly used as indicators of microbial contamination in water. These products utilize indicator-nutrients that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled water, recreational water, waste water and water from private wells.  Our Enterolert™ product detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters. Our Quanti-Tray® products, when used in conjunction with our Colilert®, Colilert®-18, Colisure® or Enterolert™ products, provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination, rather than a presence/absence indication. The Colilert®, Colilert®-18, Colisure® and Quanti-Tray® products have been approved by the EPA and by regulatory agencies in certain other countries.   6    Table of Contents  Our Filta-Max® product is used in the detection of Cryptosporidium in water. Cryptosporidium is a parasite that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested. Testing of water supplies for Cryptosporidium has been mandated by regulation only in the United Kingdom. On December 29, 2006, the Drinking Water Inspectorate in the U.K. published a proposal to discontinue the regulation that requires testing water supplies for Cryptosporidium. Subsequently, regulatory changes were approved and will become effective January 1, 2009. Beginning in 2009, therefore, we believe that we may lose a substantial portion of our sales of Filta-Max® products in England and Wales, which were $2.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2007. Effective September 2007, we commenced distribution of certain water testing kits manufactured by Invitrogen Corporation (“Invitrogen”). The Invitrogen kits complement our IDEXX developed Cryptosporidium and Giardia testing products.  PRODUCTION ANIMAL SEGMENT  We sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to detect a wide range of diseases and to monitor health status in production animals. Our production animal products are purchased primarily by government laboratories and poultry, cattle and swine producers. Our largest product is a post-mortem test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE” or “mad cow disease”). Other significant products include ante-mortem diagnostic tests for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (“PRRS”), pseudorabies (“PRV”) in pigs and bovine viral diarrhea (“BVDV”) virus in cattle.  OTHER  Dairy  Our principal product for use in testing for antibiotic residue in milk is the SNAP® Beta-Lactam test. Our primary customers are dairy producers and processors who use our tests worldwide for quality assurance of raw milk.  OPTI Medical Systems  We sell OPTI® point-of-care analyzers and related consumables for use in human medical hospitals and clinics to measure electrolytes, blood gases, acid-base balance, glucose and ionized calcium, and to calculate other parameters such as bicarbonate and anion gap. These analyzers are used primarily in emergency rooms, operating rooms, cardiac monitoring areas and any locations where time-critical diagnostic testing is performed within the hospital setting. The OPTI® CCA Touch Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer runs single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes; the OPTI® R Analyzer runs reusable cassettes in various analyte configurations; and the OPTI® Lion Analyzer runs single-use electrolyte cassettes.  MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION  We market, sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing, sales and technical service groups, as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We maintain sales offices outside the U.S. in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Sales and marketing expense was $151.9 million, $115.9 million and $102.0 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, or 16% of sales in each year.  Generally, we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product, technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory requirements and other factors. We market our veterinary diagnostic and pharmaceutical products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the U.S., with most instruments sold directly by IDEXX sales personnel, and test kits, pharmaceutical products and instrument consumables supplied primarily by the distribution channel. Outside the U.S., we sell our veterinary diagnostic products through our direct sales force and, in certain countries, through distributors and other resellers. We sell our reference laboratory services worldwide through our direct sales force. We market our software and digital radiography products through our direct sales force primarily in the U.S. We market our water and food diagnostics products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada. Outside the U.S. and Canada, we market these products through selected independent distributors and, in certain countries, through our direct sales force. We sell our OPTI® electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the U.S. and sell most of the related consumables through the distribution channel. Outside the U.S., we sell our OPTI® electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumables primarily through distributors and other resellers.   7    Table of Contents  Our largest customers are our U.S. distributors of our products in the CAG segment. One of our CAG distributors, Butler Animal Health Supply, LLC, accounted for 8%, 9% and 10% of our 2007, 2006 and 2005 revenue, respectively, and 5% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and 4% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2005.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  Our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas. Our research and development activity is focused primarily on development of new diagnostic instrument platforms and information systems, new immunoassay devices, new diagnostic tests, new animal drugs, enhanced practice information systems, and improvements in the performance, connectivity, usability, and interoperability of our products and services. Our research and development expenses, which consist of salaries, employee benefits, materials and consulting costs, were $67.3 million, $53.6 million and $40.9 million, or 7.3% of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and 6.4% of sales in 2005.  PATENTS AND LICENSES  We actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies. We also license patents and technologies from third parties.  Important patents and licenses include:       •   An exclusive license from the Regents of the University of California to patents concerning diagnostic products for FIV that expire in 2009; and other patents covering various reagents, kits and/or immunoassays for detecting FIV antibodies that expire beginning in 2014;         •   Exclusive licenses from Tulane University and the University of Texas to patents and patent applications relating to the detection of Lyme disease that expire beginning in 2019;         •   A patent concerning the Colilert®-18 product that expires in 2014;         •   A patent concerning the Quanti-Tray® product that expires in 2014;         •   A patent that relates to certain methods and kits for simultaneously detecting antigens and antibodies, which covers certain of our SNAP® products, including our SNAP® Combo FIV/FELV and canine SNAP® 3Dx® and 4Dx® combination tests, that expires in 2014;         •   An exclusive license from Boehringer Ingelheim to certain patents covering reagents and methods for detecting the PRRS virus that expire beginning in 2012;         •   An exclusive license from Cornell University to patents covering methods for detecting BVDV that expire beginning in 2017.    To the extent some of our products may now, or in the future, embody technologies protected by patents, copyrights or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”  PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY  Many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third parties, who are in some cases sole source suppliers, to supply us with certain important components, raw materials and consumables used in or with our products.  VetTest® Chemistry Analyzers are manufactured for us by Tokyo Parts Industrial Company, Ltd. under an agreement that renews annually unless either party notifies the other of its decision not to renew. VetTest® slides are supplied exclusively by Ortho under supply agreements with Ortho (the “Ortho Agreements”). We are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of VetTest® slides from Ortho to the extent Ortho is able to supply those requirements. In addition, we have committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain VetTest® slides through 2010. Under these agreements Ortho will also supply the slide consumables used in the Catalyst Dx™ Chemistry Analyzer. The Ortho Agreements expire on December 31, 2025.   8    Table of Contents  The VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzer and related consumables are manufactured for us by QBC Diagnostics, Inc. (“QBCD”) under a supply agreement that expires on December 31, 2020. The VetLyte® Electrolyte Analyzer is manufactured for us by Roche Diagnostics Corporation under an agreement that requires Roche Diagnostics to supply analyzers through December 31, 2009 provided that we achieve specified purchase levels, and consumables and spare parts through December 31, 2013.  IDEXX VetLab® UA™ urinalysis strips are manufactured for us by Roche Diagnostics under agreements that expire on December 31, 2010 but are renewable at our option through December 31, 2020 if we achieve certain purchase levels under those agreements.  IDEXX VetLab® UA™ Analyzers are manufactured for us by 77 Elektronika Kft. under agreements that expire on December 31, 2022, and which require 77 Elektronika to supply spare parts for five years following expiration.  The IDEXX Coag Dx™ Analyzer and associated cartridges are manufactured for us by International Technidyne Corporation (“ITC”) under an agreement that expires on February 6, 2017, but which we may extend until February 6, 2022 if we achieve certain minimum purchase levels under the agreement, and which requires ITC to supply consumables and spare parts for five years following expiration.

These include active ingredients for our pharmaceutical products, certain digital radiography systems, certain other instruments, instrument consumables, and certain components used in our SNAP® rapid assay devices, water testing products, and instruments, including in LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzers. We have in the past been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from single source suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products.  We do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales.  COMPETITION  We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to compete with changing technologies, which could affect the marketability of our products and services. Our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products, integrate our products, develop and maintain effective sales channels, attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop and implement production and marketing plans, obtain or license patent rights, and obtain adequate capital resources.  We compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to large pharmaceutical and human medical diagnostics companies. Our competitors vary in our different markets. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct research activities and may commercialize products, which could compete with our products, on their own or through joint ventures. Some of our competitors have substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than we do.  Competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below:       •   Veterinary diagnostic products and food and water testing products. We compete primarily on the basis of the ease of use, speed, accuracy, quality of the information provided, and other performance characteristics of our products and services (including unique tests), the breadth of our product line and services, the effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, the quality of our technical and customer service, and our pricing relative to the value of our products.     9    Table of Contents      •   Veterinary laboratory and consulting services. In this market, we compete primarily on the basis of quality, consistency of service levels, technology, and our pricing relative to the value of our services. We compete in most geographic locations in the U.S. with Antech Diagnostics, a unit of VCA Antech, Inc.         •   Veterinary pharmaceuticals. We compete primarily on the basis of the performance characteristics of our products.         •   Practice Information Management and Digital Radiography Systems. We compete primarily on the basis of functionality, connectivity to equipment and other systems, performance characteristics, effectiveness of our customer service, information handling capabilities, advances in technologies, and our pricing relative to the value of our products and services.         •   Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzers for the human medical diagnostics point-of-care market. In this market we compete primarily with large human medical diagnostics companies such as Radiometer A/S, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Instrumentation Laboratory, Abbott Diagnostics, and Roche Diagnostics. We compete primarily on the basis of ease of use, menu, convenience, international distribution and service, instrument reliability, and our pricing relative to the value of our products.    GOVERNMENT REGULATION  Many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to, among other things, product approvals, manufacturing, marketing and promotion, recordkeeping, testing, quality, storage, and product disposal. The following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.  Veterinary diagnostic products. Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including our production animal products and our rapid assay lines of business, are veterinary biological products for infectious diseases that are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”). The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A number of foreign governments accept APHIS approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals. However, compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries. We also are required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. We have obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine and our distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee.  Our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the “FDC Act”). While the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the FDA and does not subject us to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“cGMP”), these products must not be adulterated or misbranded under the FDC Act.  These products also are subject to the European Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device regulations for all European Union (“EU”) member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain European Conformity (“CE”) marking for their products.  Veterinary pharmaceuticals. The manufacture and sale of veterinary pharmaceuticals are regulated by the Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”) of the FDA. A new animal drug may not be commercially marketed in the U.S. unless it has been approved as safe and effective by CVM. Approval may be requested by filing a new animal drug application (“NADA”) with CVM containing substantial evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of the drug. Data regarding manufacturing methods and controls also are required to be submitted with the NADA. Manufacturers of animal drugs must also comply with cGMP and Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”). Sales of animal drugs in countries outside the U.S. require compliance with the laws of those countries, which may be extensive.   10    Table of Contents  Water testing products. Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the U.S. that is required by the EPA, the test must first be approved by the EPA. The EPA approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval. Our Colilert®, Colilert®-18, Colisure®, Quanti-Tray®, Filta-Max® and SimPlate® for heterotropic plate counts (“HPC”) products have been approved by the EPA. The sale of water testing products also is subject to extensive and lengthy regulatory processes in many other countries around the world.  Dairy testing products. The sale of dairy testing products in the U.S. is regulated by the FDA in conjunction with the AOAC Research Institute (“AOAC RI”). Before a product can be sold, extensive product performance data must be submitted in accordance with a protocol that is approved by the FDA and the AOAC RI. Following approval of a product by the FDA, the product must also be approved by the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (“NCIMS”), an oversight body that includes state, federal and industry representatives. Our dairy antibiotic residue testing products have been approved by the FDA and NCIMS. While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI approval as part of their regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory processes.  Human point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. Our OPTI® instrument systems are classified as Class II medical devices, and their design, manufacture and marketing are regulated by the FDA. Accordingly, we must comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our OPTI® products. The FDA’s Quality System regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records, and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. New OPTI® products fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a 510(k) application.  OPTI® products are also subject to the European Medical Device Directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold.  Any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation. These may involve food, drug, medical device and water-quality regulations of the FDA, the EPA and the USDA, as well as state, local and foreign governments. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”  EMPLOYEES  At December 31, 2007, we had approximately 4,700 full-time and part-time employees.     ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.  We May Be Unsuccessful in Maintaining Our Growth Rate  Our ability to maintain our growth rate depends on our successful implementation of various strategies, including:       •   Developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative new products with new features, functions and capabilities, including in-house laboratory analyzers such as Catalyst Dx™ and SNAPshot Dx™, rapid assay and other specialized diagnostic tests and services, water testing products, production animal diagnostic products, and companion animal veterinary pharmaceuticals, as well as improving and enhancing existing products;         •   Developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies; and identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business areas for us;     11    Table of Contents      •   Increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of these products, including the interoperability among the IDEXX VetLab® instrument suite, Cornerstone® practice information management system, IDEXX VetLab® Station, IDEXX-PACS™ software and IDEXX Reference Laboratories;         •   Expanding our market by expanding the installed base of our instrumentation through customer acquisition and retention and increasing use of our products by our customers; and         •   Strengthening our sales and marketing activities both within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the U.S.    However, we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase or sustain our rate of growth or profitability.  Our Dependence on a Limited Number of Suppliers Could Limit Our Ability to Sell Certain Products or Reduce Our Profitability  We currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products include our VetAutoread™ hematology, VetLyte® electrolyte and IDEXX VetLab® UA™ urinalysis, CoagDx™ blood coagulation analyzers and related consumables and accessories; the consumables associated with our VetTest® Chemistry Analyzers; image capture plates used in our digital radiography system; active ingredients for pharmaceutical products; and certain components and raw materials used in our SNAP® rapid assay devices, water testing products and LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzers. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future, we could face cost increases or reductions, or delays or discontinuations in product shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Our Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture, Which Could Negatively Affect Our Ability to Supply the Market  Many of our rapid assay and production animal diagnostic products are biologics, which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex. Unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy (such as most pharmaceuticals), biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials. Difficulty in characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria. Our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  We May be Required to Discontinue Sales of One of Our Veterinary Pharmaceutical Products  For the year ended December 31, 2007, 2% of CAG revenue (or $15.4 million) was attributable to sales of our highest-selling pharmaceutical product. This product is sold under the FDA’s regulatory discretion and we believe that the FDA would require us to discontinue sales of the product within a short period if and when the FDA approves another product to treat the same condition, whether such new product was our product or that of another commercial supplier. In addition, we have a finite inventory of the raw materials used in the manufacture of this product, and these raw materials are no longer commercially available. We believe that our remaining inventory of raw materials will be adequate to satisfy existing market demand until late 2008 or early 2009. We are seeking FDA approval of a new product for the same application based on different raw materials. FDA approval of this new product would mitigate the commercial risk that we would be required to stop selling our current product due either to FDA approval of another manufacturer’s product or to the full depletion of our inventory of raw materials. While we hope to transition smoothly to our new product, we cannot predict when or if the FDA will approve our new product or any product that treats the same condition from another manufacturer. Further, there can be no assurances that the new product would achieve the same revenue and profitability as our existing product.   12    Table of Contents  Various Government Regulations Could Limit or Delay Our Ability to Market and Sell Our Products  In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the USDA, the FDA and the EPA. Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including our canine, feline, poultry and livestock tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale in the U.S. Our water testing products must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the U.S. as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA. Our pharmaceutical and dairy testing products require approval by the FDA. The manufacture and sale of our OPTI® line of human point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by the FDA and require approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially in the U.S. The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries. Any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the U.S. or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products from the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Our Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Our Proprietary Technologies  We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us.  We cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights. In this regard, we expect that revenues and profit margins associated with sales of our SNAP® FIV/FeLV tests are likely to decline following the expiration in June 2009 of a U.S. patent that we exclusively license that broadly covers products that diagnose feline immunodeficiency virus.  In the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Distributor Purchasing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results  We sell many of our products, including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the U.S., through distributors. Distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the end-user demand for our products. In addition, our agreements with distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days notice. Because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors, the loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency, timing or size of distributor purchases, could have a negative effect on our results of operations. Our financial performance, therefore, is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable.  Distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies. Consolidation within distribution channels would increase our customer concentration level, which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph.  Increased Competition and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results  We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies. Competitors may develop products that that are superior to our products, and as a result, we may lose existing customers and market share. Some of our competitors and potential competitors, including large human pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies, have substantially greater financial resources than us, and greater experience in manufacturing, marketing, research and development, obtaining regulatory approvals and conducting clinical trials than we do.   13    Table of Contents  Changes in Testing Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results  The market for our companion and production animal diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors. The introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing. Changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect. Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Our production animal products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence. In addition, changes in government regulations could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing, such as our dairy and water products. Declines in testing for any of the reasons described could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  On December 29, 2006, the Drinking Water Inspectorate in the U.K. published a proposal to discontinue the regulation that requires testing water supplies for Cryptosporidium. Subsequently, regulatory changes were approved and will become effective January 1, 2009. Beginning in 2009, we believe that we may lose a substantial portion of our sales of Filta-Max® products in England and Wales, which were $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.  Consolidation of Veterinary Hospitals Could Negatively Affect Our Business  An increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners in the U.S. include VCA Antech, Inc. and Banfield, The Pet Hospital, both of which are currently customers of IDEXX. A similar trend is developing in the U.K. and may in the future also develop in other countries. Corporate owners of veterinary hospitals could attempt to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results. In addition, certain corporate owners, most notably VCA Antech, our primary competitor in the U.S. market for reference laboratory services, also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals. Any hospitals acquired by these companies are likely to use their laboratory services almost exclusively. In addition, because these companies compete with us in the laboratory services business, hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services.  Our Inexperience in the Human Point-of-Care Market Could Inhibit Our Success in this Market  Upon acquiring the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc in January 2007, we entered the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market for the first time with the sale of the OPTI® line of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. The human point-of-care medical diagnostics market differs in many respects from the veterinary medical market. Significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more extensive regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, a more segmented customer base, and more rapid technological innovation. Our inexperience in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary medical market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary medical market.   14    Table of Contents  Risks Associated with Doing Business Internationally Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results  For the year ended December 31, 2007, 40% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales. Possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, import/export duties and quotas, and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets. Prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period. In addition, many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign currencies are manufactured, sourced, or both, in the U.S. and our costs are incurred in U.S. dollars. We utilize non-speculative forward currency exchange contracts and natural hedges to mitigate foreign currency exposure. However, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our operating margins.  The Loss of Our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Could Adversely Affect Our Business  We rely on the management and leadership of Jonathan W. Ayers, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. We do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for Mr. Ayers. The loss of Mr. Ayers could have a material adverse impact on our business.  We Could Be Subject to Class Action Litigation Due to Stock Price Volatility, which, if it Occurs, Could Result in Substantial Costs or Large Judgments Against Us  The market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  If Our Quarterly Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our Stock Price to Decline, Resulting in Losses to You  Our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing of distributor purchases, product launches, operating expenditures, litigation and claim-related expenditures; changes in competitors’ product offerings; and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall.  Future Operating Results Could Be Negatively Affected By the Resolution of Various Uncertain Tax Positions and by Potential Changes to Tax Incentives  In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination was made. Our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions. If we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives, our inability to use these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings.     ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
