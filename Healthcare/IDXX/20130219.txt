DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT       During 2012, we operated primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the veterinary and bioresearch markets, which we refer to as the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”) and products for livestock and poultry health, which we refer to as Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics (“LPD”). Prior to the second quarter of 2010, we referred to our LPD segment as our Production Animal Segment. We also operate two smaller operating segments that comprise products for milk quality and safety (“Dairy”) and products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market (“OPTI Medical”). Financial information about the Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments is combined and presented with one of our remaining pharmaceutical product lines and our out-licensing arrangements in an “Other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our segments, including geographic information, and our product and service categories.       COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP       CAG offers a set of discrete products and services as described below. The breadth and complementary nature of our products and services permit us to offer integrated disease-management diagnostic solutions that leverage the advantages of both point-of-care and outside laboratory testing, facilitate the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary practice and between the veterinary practice and its clients, and provide us with scale in sales and distribution. Our objective is to provide veterinarians with the tools and services to enhance the pet owner experience with veterinary medical care, while also growing veterinary practice revenues and improving staff efficiencies.       VetConnect® PLUS. In the third quarter of 2012, we launched VetConnect® PLUS, a cloud-based technology that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients’ diagnostic data from both IDEXX in-house analyzers, Rapid Assays and IDEXX Reference Laboratories in one place. VetConnect® PLUS combines all results that have been run on a patient with IDEXX VetLab® Station and Reference Laboratories, and thus allows the veterinarian to easily see and trend patient-specific diagnostic results, enabling greater medical insight. In addition, VetConnect® PLUS provides instant mobile or Internet access to results, whether run at IDEXX Reference Labs or on in-house equipment. Results can easily be printed or emailed from VetConnect® PLUS to pet owners or other veterinarians. In this way, VetConnect® PLUS can aid the veterinarian and the practice staff in engaging the pet owner in the patient’s care, which can support greater compliance to care recommendations or preventive care protocols.        Instruments and Consumables       We currently market an integrated suite of in-house laboratory analyzers for use in providing reference laboratory quality diagnostic results in companion animal veterinary practices that we refer to as the IDEXX VetLab® suite of analyzers. The IDEXX VetLab® suite includes several instrument systems, as well as associated proprietary consumable products, all of which are described below:                               4           Blood and Urine Chemistry. We sell two chemistry analyzers, the Catalyst Dx® Chemistry Analyzer and the VetTest® Chemistry Analyzer, that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assistance in diagnosing physiologic conditions. Both instruments use consumables manufactured for IDEXX by Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”), a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, based on Ortho’s dry slide technology (“Catalyst Dx® slides,” “VetTest® slides” or “slides”). In addition, the Catalyst Dx® analyzer also uses dry slide electrolyte consumables manufactured by IDEXX at OPTI Medical Systems, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Blood tests commonly run on these analyzers include glucose, alkaline phosphatase, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), albumin, calcium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (“BUN”), and total protein. Tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels. Both analyzers also run a urine test called urine protein:creatinine ratio, which assists in the detection of early renal disease.       The Catalyst Dx® analyzer is our latest generation chemistry analyzer, which was launched in 2008. The Catalyst Dx® analyzer provides significantly improved throughput, ease of use and menu relative to the VetTest® analyzer, including the ability to run electrolytes. Key ease-of-use features include the ability to run a whole blood sample using an on-board centrifuge, the ability to run pre-packaged, multi-slide clips in addition to single chemistry slides, and an automated metering system. The Catalyst Dx® analyzer also enables automated dilutions, which is an ease-of-use feature both for certain blood chemistries and the test for urine protein:creatinine ratio. The Catalyst Dx® analyzer allows a veterinarian to run multiple patient samples simultaneously; to run different sample types including whole blood, plasma, serum and urine; to perform 28 different chemistry and electrolyte tests; and to automatically calculate other parameters and ratios important to blood chemistry analysis. In addition, the Catalyst Dx® analyzer runs a test to measure phenobarbital levels in blood, allowing veterinarians to adjust anticonvulsant medication more quickly and efficiently.       Our VetLyte® Electrolyte Analyzer measures three electrolytes—sodium, potassium and chloride—to aid in evaluating acid-base and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration.       Our VetStat® Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer measures electrolytes, blood gases, glucose and ionized calcium, and calculates other parameters, such as base excess and anion gap. These measurements aid veterinarians in diagnosing various disease states, evaluating fluid therapy choices and measuring respiratory function. The VetStat® analyzer runs single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes. The VetStat® analyzer and its cassettes are manufactured by OPTI Medical Systems.       Sales of consumables for use in our installed base of chemistry analyzers provide the majority of consumables volumes and revenues generated from our installed base of IDEXX VetLab® equipment.       Hematology. We sell four hematology analyzers that assess the cellular components of blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets (also called a complete blood count (“CBC”)). These analyzers include the ProCyte Dx® Hematology Analyzer, which uses laser-flow cytometry, optical fluorescence and laminar-flow impedance in its analysis; the LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzer and the newly launched LaserCyte® Dx Hematology Analyzer, which both use laser-flow cytometry technology in their analysis; and the IDEXX VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzer. In addition, the ProCyte Dx® Hematology Analyzer, the LaserCyte® Dx Hematology Analyzer and the LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzer each have the ability to analyze the components of certain body fluids. We also sell the Coag Dx™ Analyzer, which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders.        The ProCyte Dx® analyzer is our premier hematology analyzer, which we launched in 2010. The ProCyte Dx® analyzer provides significantly improved throughput, accuracy and more complete medical information relative to the LaserCyte® and VetAutoread™ hematology analyzers. The ProCyte Dx® analyzer provides up to 24 different blood parameters including the ability to detect band neutrophils and nucleated red blood cells for a more complete picture of a patient’s health. The ProCyte Dx® is validated for nine companion animal species (canine, feline, equine, bovine, ferret, rabbit, gerbil, pig and mini pig) with research and development efforts focused on validating results for additional species. In January 2013, we launched the LaserCyte® Dx Hematology Analyzer, which combines the advanced capabilities of the original LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzer with several features of our ProCyte Dx® analyzer.                5           Quantitative Immunoassay Testing. With multiple-patient testing functionality, the SNAPshot Dx® analyzer provides quantitative measurements of total thyroxine (“T4”), cortisol and bile acids to assist in the evaluation of thyroid, adrenal and liver function, respectively. The SNAPshot Dx® analyzer also reads, interprets and records the results of many IDEXX rapid assay SNAP® tests, including our canine SNAP® 4Dx® and SNAP® 4Dx® Plus tests, feline SNAP® FIV/FeLV Combo test, canine SNAP® cPL™ test, feline SNAP® fPL™ test, SNAP® Feline Triple® test and canine SNAP® Heartworm RT test.       Urinalysis. The IDEXX VetLab® UA™ Analyzer provides rapid, semi-quantitative chemical urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use.       IDEXX VetLab® Station. The IDEXX VetLab® Station (“IVLS”) connects and integrates the diagnostic information from all the IDEXX VetLab® equipment and thus provides reference laboratory information management system capability. We sell the IVLS as an integral component of the Catalyst Dx®, LaserCyte®, LaserCyte® Dx and ProCyte Dx® analyzers and also as a standalone hardware platform. The IVLS includes a user interface to simplify laboratory work flow, connect with a practice management system and send information to run the individual analyzers. IVLS also generates one integrated patient report incorporating all of the lab work generated by the IDEXX VetLab® suite; stores, retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data, including SNAP® test results; and sends and receives information from practice management systems, including the IDEXX Cornerstone® system, as well as a wide variety of third-party systems. IVLS also connects back to IDEXX through SmartServiceTM Solutions, a secure Internet link that enables us to provide diagnostic service, software updates and support for certain IDEXX VetLab® instruments through remote access.        Rapid Assays        We sell a broad range of single-use, handheld test kits under the SNAP® name that provide quick, accurate and convenient diagnostic test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions. These kits work without the use of instrumentation, although many kits may also be read automatically by the SNAPshot Dx® analyzer as discussed above.        Principal single-use canine tests are:     ·    SNAP® 4Dx® Plus, launched during the second quarter of 2012, which tests for the tick-borne diseases Lyme disease, Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia ewingii, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Anaplasma platys and the mosquito-borne disease canine heartworm;    ·    SNAP® 4Dx®, which tests for the tick-borne diseases Lyme disease, Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum and the mosquito-borne disease canine heartworm;    ·    SNAP® 3Dx®, which tests for Lyme disease, Ehrlichia canis and canine heartworm;    ·    SNAP® Heartworm RT, which tests for canine heartworm;     ·    SNAP® Parvo, which tests for parvovirus, a virus causing life-threatening damage to the immune system and intestinal tract;    ·    SNAP® cPL™, which tests for canine pancreatitis;    ·    SNAP® Giardia, which is a fecal test for soluble Giardia antigens, a common cause of waterborne infection; and    ·    SNAP® Leishmania, which tests for a parasitological disease transmitted by mosquitoes that affects biological systems and vital organs.      Principal single-use feline tests are:     ·    SNAP® Feline Triple®, which tests for feline immunodeficiency virus (“FIV”) (which is similar to the human AIDS virus), feline leukemia virus (“FeLV”), and feline heartworm;     ·    SNAP® FIV/FeLV Combo Test, which tests for FIV and FeLV;    ·    SNAP® FeLV, which tests for FeLV;    ·    SNAP® fPL™, which we launched during the second quarter of 2011, tests for feline pancreatitis; and    ·    SNAP® Giardia, which is a fecal test for soluble Giardia antigens.      6               Sales of canine vector-borne disease tests, including SNAP® 4Dx® Plus, SNAP® 4Dx®, SNAP® 3Dx® and SNAP® Heartworm RT, are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice.        In addition to our single-use tests, we sell a line of microwell-based test kits under the PetChek® name for canine heartworm, FIV and FeLV. Larger clinics and laboratories use these kits to test multiple samples and provide ease-of-use and cost advantages to high-volume customers.        Reference Laboratory Diagnostic and Consulting Services       Reference Laboratory Diagnostic Services. We offer commercial reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services to veterinarians worldwide, including customers in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Africa, China and South Korea. Customers use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities. Most test results have same-day or next-day turnaround times. Our laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in animals, including virtually all tests that can be run in-clinic at the veterinary practice with our instruments or rapid assays. This menu of tests also includes a number of specialized and proprietary tests that we have developed that allow practitioners to diagnose increasingly relevant conditions in dogs and cats, including heart disease, allergies, pancreatitis and infectious diseases. Canine vector-borne disease testing volumes are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice.       Health Monitoring and Biological Materials Testing. In November 2011, we acquired the research and diagnostic laboratory (“RADIL”) business of the College of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Missouri. RADIL provides health monitoring and diagnostic testing services to bioresearch customers in North America, Europe and Asia. The financial results of RADIL are reflected in the financial results of our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services business.        Consulting Services. Additionally, we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine and advisory services, including radiology, cardiology, internal medicine and ultrasound consulting. These services enable veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the Internet.       Practice Management and Digital Imaging Systems and Services        Practice Management Systems and Services. We develop, market and sell practice management systems, including hardware and software, and services that run key functions of veterinary clinics, including managing patient electronic health records, scheduling (including boarding and grooming), client communication, billing and inventory management. Our principal practice management system is Cornerstone®. We also support several legacy practice management systems installed with our customers, including IDEXX Better Choice®, IDEXX VPM™ and IDEXX VetLINK®. In December 2012, we acquired the assets of Sneakers Software, Inc., which sold DVMAX® Veterinary Practice Management Software and such acquisition did not have a material effect on our results of operation in 2012 and is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operation in 2013.       Our practice management services include Cornerstone® Coaching, Practice Profile™, IDEXX Reminder Service, VetVault® Backup Solution, PetDetect® Pet Identification System and Pet Health Network® Pro. Pet Health Network® Pro, beta launched in the third quarter of 2012, is a subscription-based service that permits veterinarians to provide online communication and education to pet owners before, during and after each patient visit. We anticipate a full commercial launch of Pet Health Network® Pro during the first quarter of 2013. Certain of our services are compatible with non-IDEXX practice management systems.        Digital Imaging Systems and Services. Our digital radiography systems capture radiographic images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film and the film development process, which generally requires the use of hazardous chemicals and darkrooms. We market and sell two digital radiography systems for use in the small animal veterinary hospital: the IDEXX I-Vision CR®, our latest generation computed radiography system, which we launched in September 2011 and the IDEXX-DR™ 1417 system. We also market and sell the IDEXX EquiView® DR system for use as a portable unit in ambulatory veterinary practices, such as equine practices.        7               Our digital radiography systems use picture archiving and communication system (“PACS”) software, IDEXX-PACS™ and IDEXX EquiView PACS®, for the viewing, manipulation, management, storage and retrieval of the digital images generated by the digital capture plate. The PACS software also permits images from our digital radiography systems to be integrated into patients’ medical records in the Cornerstone® system, as well as transferred to other practice management systems. In September 2011, we launched IDEXX I-Vision Mobile™, an application that allows veterinarians with the IDEXX-DR™ 1417 and IDEXX I-Vision CR™ systems, as well as our legacy digital radiography systems, to request, view and send images using an iPad® or an Android™ mobile tablet. This application integrates with our IDEXX-PACS™ software.       WATER        We offer a range of products used in the detection and quantification of various microbiological parameters in water.       Our principal products are the Colilert®, Colilert®-18 and Colisure® tests, which simultaneously detect the presence of total coliforms and E. coli in water. These organisms are broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. These products utilize nutrient-indicators that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled water, recreational water, waste water and water from private wells.       Our Enterolert® products detect the presence of enterococci in drinking, waste and recreational waters. Enterococci, bacteria normally found in human and animal waste, are organisms broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. Our Pseudalert® products detect the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pool, spa and bottled water. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen that can cause “hot-tub rash,” “swimmer’s ear” and potentially fatal infections in immunocompromised individuals. Our Filta-Max® and Filta-Max xpress® products are used in the detection of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in water. Cryptosporidium and Giardia are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested. We also distribute certain water testing kits manufactured by Life Technologies Corporation that complement our Cryptosporidium and Giardia testing products.       Our Quanti-Tray® products, when used in conjunction with our Colilert®, Colilert®-18, Colisure®, Enterolert®, Pseudalert™ or Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) products, provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination, rather than a presence/absence indication. Our SimPlate for HPC product detects the total number of the most common bacteria in a water sample.        We also sell consumables, parts and accessories to be used with many of our water testing products.       LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY DIAGNOSTICS       We sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to detect a wide range of diseases and to monitor health status in livestock and poultry. Our livestock and poultry diagnostic products are purchased by government and private laboratories that provide testing services to cattle, swine and poultry veterinarians and producers. Our principal products include tests for Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (“BVDV”) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (“PRRS”). BVDV is a common and contagious viral infection that suppresses the immune system, making the animal susceptible to a host of other infections, impacting beef and dairy production yields as a result. PRRS is a contagious virus causing reproductive problems and respiratory diseases. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we launched a milk-based pregnancy test for detecting pregnancy in dairy cattle, which provides a means to optimize reproductive efficiency. Since 2009, changes in testing regulations pertaining to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (“BSE” or “mad cow disease”) have led to a decline in revenues from sales of our BSE test products. Revenue from BSE testing products was less than $10 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012. BSE is a fatal neurodegenerative disease in cattle that causes a spongy degeneration in the brain and spinal cord.           8           OTHER       Dairy       The principal products in our Dairy business are our SNAP® tests used to detect antibiotic drug residue in milk. Dairy producers and processors worldwide use our tests for quality and safety assurance of raw milk. Our primary product line for detecting antibiotic residue in milk is SNAP® Beta-Lactam, which detects penicillin, amoxicillin, ceftiofur and cephapirin residues, followed by SNAPduo® Beta-Tetra, which detects certain tetracycline antibiotic residues in addition to those detected by the SNAP® Beta Lactam test kits. We also sell SNAP® tests for the detection of certain other contaminants in milk, such as chemical melamine and Aflatoxin M1.        OPTI Medical Systems       We sell OPTI® point-of-care analyzers and related consumables for use in human medical hospitals and clinics to measure electrolytes, blood gases, acid-base balance, glucose, lactate, BUN and ionized calcium, and to calculate other parameters such as base excess and anion gap. These analyzers are used primarily in emergency rooms, operating rooms, cardiac monitoring areas and other locations where time-critical diagnostic testing is performed within the hospital setting. The OPTI® CCA and OPTI® Touch Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzers run single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes; the OPTI® R Analyzer runs reusable cassettes in various analyte configurations; and the OPTI® LION™ Stat Electrolyte Analyzer runs single-use electrolyte cassettes. OPTI Medical Systems also manufactures our VetStat® analyzer, an instrument and consumable system that is a member of the IDEXX VetLab® suite for the veterinary market. In addition, OPTI Medical Systems provides the electrolyte module and dry slide reagents that make up the electrolyte testing functionality of the Catalyst Dx® analyzer.       Other Activities       In the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold our Acarexx® and SURPASS® veterinary pharmaceutical products and a feline insulin product under development. Upon completion of this transaction we restructured the remaining pharmaceutical division and realigned two of our pharmaceutical product lines to the Rapid Assay line of business, which is part of CAG, and realigned the remainder of the products, which comprised of one product line and two out-licensing arrangements in effect at the time of the realignment, to the Other segment. We retained certain drug delivery technologies that we have continued to seek to commercialize through agreements with third parties, such as pharmaceutical companies, that we also include in the Other segment. We earned milestone payments of $3.5 million, $3.0 million and $3.0 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, in connection with the achievement of certain sales milestones by the acquirer following commercialization of the feline insulin product. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business. Since realignment to the Rapid Assay line of business, we have discontinued the production and sale of one of the remaining pharmaceutical product lines. Neither this product line nor the second remaining product line is or was a significant contributor to revenue in the Rapid Assay line of business.       MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION        We market, sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing, sales and technical service groups, as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We maintain sales offices outside the U.S. in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Poland and South Korea. Sales and marketing expense was $217.0 million, $204.9 million and $179.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, or 16.8% of consolidated revenue in each of 2012 and 2011 and 16.3% of consolidated revenue in 2010.                               9           Generally, we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product, technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory requirements and other factors. We market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the U.S., with most instruments sold directly by IDEXX sales personnel and rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables supplied primarily by distributors. Outside the U.S., we sell our companion animal diagnostic products through our direct sales force and, in certain countries, through distributors and other resellers. We sell our veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services worldwide through our direct sales force. We market our software and digital radiography products through our direct sales force and through distributors primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We market our water, livestock and poultry and dairy products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada. Outside the U.S. and Canada, we market these products through selected independent distributors and, in certain countries, through our direct sales force. We sell our OPTI® electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the U.S. and we sell most of the related consumables through the distribution channel. Outside the U.S., we sell our OPTI® products primarily through distributors and other resellers.       Our largest customers are our U.S. distributors of our products in the CAG segment. One of our CAG distributors, Butler Schein Animal Health Supply, LLC (“Butler”), accounted for 9% of our consolidated revenue in each of 2012, 2011 and 2010.        RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT        Our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas. We maintain active research and development programs in each of our business areas. Our research and development expenses, which consist of salaries, employee benefits, materials and external consulting and development costs, were $82.0 million, $76.0 million and $68.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, or 6.3% of revenue in 2012 and 6.2% of revenue in each of 2011 and 2010.       PATENTS AND LICENSES        We actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies. We also license patents and technologies from third parties.

Certain components incorporated into our SNAP® products and certain livestock and poultry testing kits are supplied by Moss, Inc. (“Moss”) under a supply agreement that either party may terminate with 24 months prior written notice. We are required annually to purchase a minimum amount from Moss equal to our average purchase volumes in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Annual price increases are capped at 3%. Pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement, Moss has escrowed its manufacturing information relating to the components, which may be released to us upon certain triggering events that would render Moss incapable of supplying the components to us. If such a triggering event occurs, we will make royalty payments to Moss for the use of such information until Moss is able to again begin manufacturing.       We have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single source suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”       BACKLOG       We do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales.           COMPETITION       We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. This competition is intensifying and increasing, as new competitors have entered our markets and some of our competitors have expanded the range of products and services offered to the companion animal veterinary market and expanded the geographic scope of their operations. In addition, we have to compete with changing technologies, which could affect the marketability of our products and services. Our competitive position will depend on our ability to develop proprietary or highly differentiated products and services, integrate our products, develop and maintain effective sales channels, attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop and implement production and marketing plans, obtain or license patent rights, and obtain adequate capital resources.       11               We compete with many companies ranging from large human pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies to small businesses focused on animal health. Our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and in-clinic product providers. Our competitors vary in our different markets. In some markets, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products or services, which could compete with our products, on their own or through joint ventures. Several of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than we do.       Competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below:         ·    Companion animal diagnostic offerings. We compete primarily on the basis of ease of use and speed of our products, diagnostic accuracy, product quality, breadth of our product line and services, technology, information management capability, availability of medical consultation, effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, quality of our technical and customer service, and our pricing relative to the value of our products and services in comparison with competitive products and services. Our major competitors in most geographic locations in North America are Antech Diagnostics, a unit of VCA Antech, Inc., and Abaxis, Inc.    ·    Water, livestock and poultry and dairy testing products. We compete primarily on the basis of the ease of use, speed, accuracy, product quality, and other performance characteristics of our products and services (including unique tests), the breadth of our product line and services, the effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, the quality of our technical and customer service, our ability to receive regulatory endorsements from governing agencies, and our pricing relative to the value of our products in comparison with competitive products and services. Our competitors include highly focused smaller companies and multi-billion dollar companies with small livestock and poultry diagnostics and water testing solution franchises.    ·    Practice management and digital imaging systems and services. We compete primarily on the basis of functionality, connectivity to equipment and other systems, performance characteristics, effectiveness of our implementation, training process and customer service, information handling capabilities, advances in technologies, and our pricing relative to the value of our products and services. We sell these products primarily in North America where our largest competitor is Butler.    ·    Electrolyte and blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market. We compete primarily with large human medical diagnostics companies such as Radiometer A/S, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Instrumentation Laboratory, Abbott Diagnostics, and Roche Diagnostics. We compete primarily on the basis of the ease of use, menu, convenience, international distribution and service, instrument reliability, and our pricing relative to the value of our products.      GOVERNMENT REGULATION       Many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to, among other things, product approvals, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and promotion, labeling, recordkeeping, testing, quality, storage, and product disposal. The following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.                                                   12           Veterinary diagnostic products. Diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases, including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products, are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”). These products must be approved by APHIS before they may be sold in the U.S. The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A number of foreign governments accept APHIS approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals. However, compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries. We also are required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. We have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine and our distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee. Our manufacturing facility in Montpellier, France has been approved by APHIS and we have a permit to import products manufactured in Montpellier, France to the U.S. for distribution.       Our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are veterinary medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the “FDC Act”). While the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the FDA and does not subject us to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“cGMP”), these products must not be adulterated, mislabeled or misbranded under the FDC Act.       These instrument systems also are subject to the European Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device regulations for all European Union (“EU”) member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain European Conformity (“CE”) marking for their products.       Water testing products. Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the U.S. that is regulated by the EPA, the test must first be approved by the EPA. The EPA approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval. Our Colilert®, Colilert®-18, Colisure®, Quanti-Tray®, Filta-Max xpress®, Enterolert®, and SimPlate® for heterotropic plate counts products have been approved by the EPA for use under various regulatory programs. Water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world.       Dairy testing products. Dairy products used in National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (“NCIMS”) milk-monitoring programs are regulated by the FDA as veterinary medical devices. However, before products requiring FDA approval can be sold in the U.S., performance data must be submitted in accordance with an FDA approved protocol administered by an independent body, such as the Association of Analytical Communities Research Institute (“AOAC RI”). Following approval of a product by the FDA, the product must also be approved by NCIMS, an oversight body that includes state, federal and industry representatives. Our SNAP® Beta-Lactam antibiotic residue test product has been approved by the FDA, NCIMS and AOAC RI for sale in the U.S. While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI approval as part of their regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory processes.       Human point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. Our OPTI® instrument systems are classified as Class II medical devices, and their design, manufacture and marketing are regulated by the FDA. Accordingly, we must comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our OPTI® products. The FDA’s Quality System regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. New OPTI® products fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, and which are submitted as a 510(k) application.        OPTI® Medical products are also subject to the European Medical Device Directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold.            13           Any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation. These may involve food, medical device and water-quality regulations of the FDA, the EPA and the USDA, as well as state, local and foreign governments. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”       EMPLOYEES        At February 8, 2013, we had approximately 5,400 employees.       ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS       Our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.        Our Failure to Successfully Execute Certain Strategies Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Growth and Profitability        The companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants. Our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy, which include:          ·    Developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative new or improved in-clinic laboratory analyzers that drive sales of IDEXX VetLab® instruments, grow our installed base of instruments, and increase demand for related consumable products, services and accessories;     ·    Developing and introducing new proprietary diagnostic tests and services that provide valuable medical information to our customers and effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;     ·    Increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of these products and the management of diagnostic information derived from our products;     ·    Providing our veterinary customers with the medical and business tools, information and resources that enable them to grow their practices through increased pet visits and enhanced practice of real-time care;     ·    Achieving cost improvements in our worldwide network of laboratories by implementing global best practices including lean processing techniques, incorporating technological enhancements including laboratory automation and a global laboratory information management system, employing purchasing strategies to maximize leverage of our global scale, increasing the leverage of existing infrastructure and consolidating testing in high volume laboratory hubs;     ·    Achieving cost improvements in the manufacture and service of our in-clinic laboratory analyzers by employing the benefits of economies of scale in both negotiating supply contracts and leveraging manufacturing overhead, and by improving reliability of our instruments;     ·    Expanding our served market and growing our market share by strengthening our sales and marketing activities both within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the U.S.;     ·    Identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business or geographic areas for us; and     ·    Developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies.       If we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies, our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted.                    14           Our Dependence on a Limited Number of Suppliers Could Limit Our Ability to Sell Certain Products or Reduce Our Profitability        We currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products include our Catalyst Dx® and VetTest® consumables; ProCyte Dx® hematology, IDEXX VetAutoread™ hematology, VetLyte® electrolyte, IDEXX VetLab® UA™ urinalysis, VetTest® chemistry, and Coag Dx™ blood coagulation analyzers and related consumables and accessories; image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems; and certain components and raw materials used in our SNAP® rapid assay devices, water testing products, livestock and poultry diagnostic tests, dairy testing products and LaserCyte® and LaserCyte® Dx hematology analyzers. To mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers, we seek when possible to enter into long-term contracts that ensure an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices. However, some suppliers decline to enter into long-term contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis. There can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products, that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts, or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products. In cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders, we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply. In addition, under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers, we may be unable to supply the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.        Our Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture, Which Could Negatively Affect Our Ability to Supply the Market        Many of our rapid assay, livestock and poultry diagnostic, water and dairy products are biologic products, which are products that include materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products, with samples and with the environment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria. Further, products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory, which could necessitate field actions that would require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products, and could damage customer relations. Our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.       A Weak Economy Could Result in Reduced Demand for Our Products and Services or Increased Customer Credit Risk        A substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market. Demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits with their respective owners to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing, as well as the pet owner compliance with these recommendations. Economic weakness in our significant markets in recent years has caused and could continue to cause pet owners to skip or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or could affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests, comply with a treatment plan or, even more fundamentally, continue to own a pet. In addition, concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems. A decline in patient visits to the hospital, in the willingness of pet owners to treat certain health conditions or approve certain tests, in pet ownership in general, or in the inclination of veterinarians to recommend certain tests or make capital purchases could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.            15           Demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at the government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products. Availability of funds also affects demand by the government laboratories and cattle, swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products, and by users of our human point-of-care diagnostic instruments. Economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.        In all of our markets, a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers, which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all.        Strengthening of the Rate of Exchange for the U.S. Dollar Has a Negative Effect on Our Business        Any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against non-U.S. currencies, and in particular the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Australian dollar, adversely affects our results, as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars and exported to international markets. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, approximately 26%, 26% and 25%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local currencies. To mitigate such foreign currency exposure, we utilize non-speculative forward currency exchange contracts. A strengthening U.S. dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the U.S. to pay for purchases denominated in U.S. dollars.        Various Government Regulations Could Limit or Delay Our Ability to Market and Sell Our Products        In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Our infectious disease diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including most rapid assay canine and feline SNAP® tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale in the U.S. Our water testing products must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the U.S. as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA. Our dairy testing products require approval by the FDA prior to sale in the U.S. The manufacture and sale of our OPTI® line of human point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by the FDA and these products require approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially in the U.S. The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries. Any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the U.S. or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture or sell our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.       The Impact of One of Our Distributors Becoming Non-exclusive on Our Results of Operations is Uncertain        On February 11, 2013, the Commissioners of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) granted final approval of the Agreement Containing Consent Order to Cease and Desist (“Consent Agreement”) previously reached with the FTC staff to resolve the investigation into whether IDEXX had engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Details about the FTC investigation and the resulting Consent Agreement are described in “Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”                                   16           On September 28, 2012, we entered into a modified agreement with MWI Veterinary Supply, Inc. (“MWI”) that became effective January 1, 2013. Under this modified agreement, MWI is permitted to carry any competitive products without restriction or potential negative consequence. This agreement satisfies the requirements of the Consent Agreement, that we may have exclusive distribution agreements with only two of the three largest U.S. distributors of companion animal veterinary products. The modification of our agreement with MWI will result in one or more of our competitors selling products through MWI, which we expect will increase the field sales resources of MWI used by those competitors to sell their products. Under the modified agreement with MWI, we will provide lower compensation to MWI on sales of our products since we will no longer receive the benefits of MWI’s exclusive focus on our products. We expect to reinvest savings from this lower rate of compensation in other sales and marketing resources and the selling efforts of our other distributors. We believe that the reallocation of these sales resources will help mitigate the potential effects of the loss of exclusive focus of MWI and the additional field sales resources used by our competitors. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to fully mitigate the competitive effects of the changes in the nature of our agreement with MWI. Any reduction in the relative effectiveness of our overall selling efforts could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, which we do not believe would be material.        Our Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Our Proprietary Technologies        We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us.        We cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights.        In the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.        Distributor Purchasing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results        We sell many of our products, including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the U.S., through distributors. Distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the end-user demand for our products. In addition, our agreements with U.S. distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days prior written notice. Because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors, the unanticipated loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency, timing or size of distributor purchases, could have a negative effect on our results of operations.        Distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies. Consolidation within distribution channels increases our customer concentration level, which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph.                                    17           Increased Competition and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results        We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense. Competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways. New competitors may enter our markets and new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services, which could be superior to our products and services. Some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering similar products and services to ours at lower sales prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive. In addition, multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through co-marketing or other arrangements, which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering. Some of our competitors and potential competitors, including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies, have substantially greater financial resources than us, and greater experience in manufacturing, marketing, research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do.        Changes in Testing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results        The market for our companion animal and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices. The introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing. Changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect. Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence. In addition, changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing, such as our livestock and poultry, dairy and water products. Declines in testing for any of the reasons described, along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.        Effective January 1, 2009, the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE” or “mad cow disease”) in the European Union was increased from 30 months to 48 months, which reduced the population of cattle tested by approximately 30%. In February 2011, the European Union’s Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (“SCFCAH”) agreed to allow its member states to further raise the recommended testing age to 72 months, effective July 1, 2011, which further reduced the population of cattle tested. In December 2012, the SCFCAH agreed to allow European Union member states the option to eliminate BSE testing of healthy cattle at slaughter effective March 2013. The demand for our BSE testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of these regulatory changes and could be further impacted by further changes that could be made in the future. Revenue from BSE testing products was less than $10 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012.                                                                       18           Increase in Corporate Hospital Ownership and Prevalence of Buying Consortiums Could Negatively Affect Our Business        An increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. is owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners in the U.S. include VCA Antech, Inc., National Veterinary Associates and Banfield Pet Hospital, each of which is currently a customer of IDEXX. A similar trend exists in the U.K. and may in the future also develop in other countries. Furthermore, an increasing percentage of individually owned veterinary hospitals in the U.S. are participating in buying consortiums. Corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. While we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums that we believe are positive for our business, decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums, in particular Banfield Pet Hospital, to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations, which could be material. In addition, certain corporate owners, most notably VCA Antech Inc., our primary competitor in the U.S. and Canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services, also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals. Any hospitals acquired by these companies generally use their reference laboratory services almost exclusively and shift a large portion of their testing from in-clinic testing to their reference laboratories. Furthermore, because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace, hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services, which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline.        Our Limited Experience and Small Scale in the Human Point-of-Care Market Could Inhibit Our Success in this Market        We have limited experience in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market. This market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market. Significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more extensive regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation. Our limited experience and small scale in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market.         Risks Associated with Doing Business Internationally Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results       For the year ended December 31, 2012, approximately 41% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S., compared to 43% and 41% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Various possible risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales, including disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, import/export duties and licensing requirements, natural disasters and unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets. Further, prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors. Our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results of operations for that period.        Our Operations are Vulnerable to Interruption as a Result of Natural and Man-Made Disasters or System Failures        The operation of all of our facilities may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and man-made disasters, interruptions in power supply or other system failures. While we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events.            19           We manufacture many of our significant companion animal products, including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments, many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock and poultry testing products, at a single facility in Westbrook, Maine. Certain of our companion animal products, as well as our human point-of-care products, are manufactured in Roswell, Georgia. We also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in Bern, Switzerland and Montpellier, France. In addition, we maintain major distribution facilities in North America and in the Netherlands and major reference laboratories in Memphis, Tennessee; Leipzig, Germany; Ludwigsburg, Germany; Sacramento, California; Elmhurst, Illinois; North Grafton, Massachusetts; East Brisbane, Australia; Markham, Ontario; and Wetherby, the United Kingdom. Therefore, interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.         We rely on several information systems throughout our company to keep financial records, process customer orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. If we were to experience a system disruption that impacts any of our critical functions, it could result in the loss of sales and customers, financial misstatement and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business.        We maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature. However, this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur. In addition, such insurance will not compensate us for the long-term competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations.        We Could Be Subject to Class Action Litigation Due to Stock Price Volatility, which, if it Occurs, Could Result in Substantial Costs or Large Judgments Against Us         The market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. Securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.        If Our Quarterly or Annual Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our Stock Price to Decline, Resulting in Losses to You        Our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing of distributor purchases, product launches, operating expenditures, marketing programs, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and litigation and claim-related expenditures; changes in competitors’ product offerings; changes in the economy affecting consumer spending; and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall.        Future Operating Results Could Be Negatively Affected by the Resolution of Various Uncertain Tax Positions and by Potential Changes to Tax Incentives        In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination was made. Our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions. If we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives, or if they expire or are renewed at less favorable terms, our inability to realize these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings.            20           Restrictions in Our Credit Facility or Our Inability to Obtain Financing on Favorable Terms May Limit Our Activities       Our ability to satisfy our obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative, negative and financial covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the Credit Facility could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under the Credit Facility, which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt and possibly on terms not deemed favorable.         We fund our operations, capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand, funds generated from operations and amounts available under our Credit Facility. If we were unable to obtain financing on favorable terms, we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability.
