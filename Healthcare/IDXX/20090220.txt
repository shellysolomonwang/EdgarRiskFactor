Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties discussed herein do not reflect the potential future impact of any mergers, acquisitions or dispositions. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our estimates only as of the day this annual report was first filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements may also be included in other materials released to the public. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates or expectations change.     PART I     ITEM 1. BUSINESS  We develop, manufacture and distribute products and provide services primarily for the veterinary and the food and water testing markets. We also sell a line of portable electrolytes and blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market. Our primary products and services are:       •   Point-of-care veterinary diagnostic products, comprising rapid assays and instruments and consumables;         •   Laboratory and consulting services used by veterinarians;         •   Practice information systems and services and digital radiography systems used by veterinarians;         •   Diagnostic and health-monitoring products for production animals;         •   Products that test water for certain microbiological contaminants;         •   Products that test milk for antibiotic residues; and         •   Point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers used in the human medical diagnostics market.    In the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold our Acarexx® and SURPASS® veterinary pharmaceutical products and a product under development. Upon completion of this transaction we restructured the remaining pharmaceutical business and realigned the remaining pharmaceutical product lines to other business units. We have also retained certain drug delivery technologies that we will look to utilize in development agreements with pharmaceutical companies. See note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We are a Delaware corporation and were incorporated in 1983. Our principal executive offices are located at One IDEXX Drive, Westbrook, Maine 04092, our telephone number is 207-556-0300, and our Internet address is www.idexx.com.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT  During 2008, we operated primarily through three business segments: products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”) and products for production animal health, which we refer to as the Production Animal Segment (“PAS”). We also operate two smaller segments that comprise products for dairy quality, which we refer to as Dairy, and products for the human medical diagnostic market, which we refer to as OPTI Medical. Financial information about the Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments and other activities are combined and presented in an “Other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. In addition, we maintain active research and development programs, some of which may materialize into the development and introduction of new technology, products or services that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories. In such situations, the related financial impacts are shown in the “Other” category. In connection with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business at the end of 2008, we realigned two of our remaining product lines to the Rapid Assay business, which is part of our CAG segment, and realigned the remainder of the business, which comprised one product line and two out-licensing arrangements, to the Other category. Segment information presented for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2008. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our segments, including geographic information, and about our product and service categories.  COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP  Instruments and Consumables  We currently market an integrated suite of in-house laboratory analyzers for use in veterinary practices that we refer to as the IDEXX VetLab® suite of analyzers. The IDEXX VetLab® suite includes several instrument systems, as well as associated proprietary consumable products that are described below:  Blood and Urine Chemistry.  We sell two analyzers, the Catalyst Dx™ Chemistry Analyzer and the VetTest® Chemistry Analyzer, that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for assistance in diagnosing physiologic conditions. Both instruments use consumables manufactured for IDEXX by Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”), a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, based on Ortho’s dry slide technology (“dry chemistry slides,” “VetTest® slides,” “Catalyst Dx™ slides” or “slides”). In addition to dry chemistry slides, the Catalyst Dx™ Analyzer also uses electrolyte consumables manufactured by IDEXX at OPTI Medical. Blood tests commonly run on these analyzers include glucose, alkaline phosphatase, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), creatinine, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and total protein. Tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels. Both analyzers also run a urine test called urine protein: creatinine ratio, which assists in the detection of early renal disease.  The Catalyst Dx™ Analyzer is our latest generation analyzer, which was launched in the first quarter of 2008. The Catalyst Dx™ analyzer provides significantly improved throughput, ease of use and menu, including the ability to run electrolytes, relative to the VetTest® analyzer. Key ease-of-use features include the ability to run whole blood by way of an on-board centrifuge, the ability to run pre-packaged clips in addition to single chemistry slides and an automated metering system. The Catalyst Dx™ analyzer also has the ability to run automated dilutions, which is an ease-of-use feature both for certain blood chemistries and the test for urine protein: creatinine ratio. The Catalyst Dx™ analyzer allows a veterinarian to run multiple sample types simultaneously; to run different sample types including whole blood, plasma, serum and urine; includes the ability to perform 26 different chemistry and electrolyte parameter tests; and to automatically calculate other parameters and ratios important to blood chemistry analysis.   4    Table of Contents  Our VetLyte® Electrolyte Analyzer measures three electrolytes—sodium, potassium and chloride—to aid in evaluating acid-base and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration.  Our VetStat® Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer measures electrolytes, blood gases, glucose and ionized calcium, and calculates other parameters, such as base excess and anion gap. These measurements aid veterinarians in diagnosing various disease states and evaluating fluid therapy choices and measuring respiratory function. The VetStat® analyzer runs single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes.  Sales of chemistry reagents for use in our installed base of chemistry analyzers provide the majority of consumables volumes and revenues generated from our installed base of IDEXX VetLab® equipment.  Hematology. We sell three hematology analyzers: the LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzer, which uses laser-flow cytometry technology to analyze cellular components of blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (also called a complete blood count (“CBC”)); the Coag Dx™ Analyzer, which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders; and the IDEXX VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzer, which also provides a CBC.  Quantitative Immunoassay Testing. In the first quarter of 2008, we launched the SNAPshot Dx® Analyzer, which allows the veterinarian to obtain quantitative measurements of total thyroxine (“T4”), cortisol and bile acids, which assist in the evaluation of thyroid, adrenal and liver function. The SNAPshot Dx® Analyzer is designed to significantly improve ease of use, throughput and menu relative to the previous generation IDEXX SNAP® Reader. In 2009, the SNAPshot Dx® Analyzer will also read, interpret and record the results of certain IDEXX rapid assay SNAP® tests, including our feline SNAP® FIV/FeLV Combo Test and canine SNAP® cPL™.  Urinalysis. The IDEXX VetLab® UA™ Analyzer provides rapid, semi-quantitative urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use.  IDEXX VetLab® Station. The IDEXX VetLab® Station (“IVLS”) connects and integrates the information from all the IDEXX VetLab® equipment and thus provides laboratory information management system capability. We sell the IVLS as an integral component of the Catalyst Dx™ and LaserCyte® systems and also as a standalone hardware platform. The IVLS includes a user interface to input patient information, connect with a practice management information system, and to send information to run the individual analyzers. IVLS also generates one integrated patient report; stores, retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data, including SNAP® test results; and sends and receives information from practice information management systems, including IDEXX Cornerstone® and Better Choice® systems, as well as a wide variety of third-party systems.  Rapid Assays  We provide a broad range of single-use, handheld test kits under the SNAP® name that allow quick, accurate and convenient test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions. These products enable veterinarians to provide improved service to animal owners by delivering test results and a diagnosis at the time of the patient visit, allowing the veterinarian to initiate therapy or prevention, if required. These kits work without the use of instrumentation.  Our principal single-use tests include canine combination parasite tests called SNAP® 3Dx®, which tests simultaneously for Lyme disease, Ehrlichia canis and heartworm, and SNAP®4Dx®, which additionally tests for Anaplasma phagocytophilum; a canine heartworm-only test; canine tests for parvovirus and pancreatitis; feline combination tests called the SNAP® FIV Antibody/FeLV Antigen Combo Test, which enables veterinarians to test simultaneously for feline immunodeficiency virus (“FIV”) (which is similar to the human AIDS virus) and feline leukemia virus (“FeLV”), and SNAP® Feline Triple, which additionally tests for heartworm; a feline test for FeLV only; and canine and feline tests for Giardia, a parasitic disease. Sales of canine parasite tests, including the heartworm only test, are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice. We maintain certain patents concerning diagnostic products for FIV that expire beginning in June 2009. See “Part I, Patents and Licenses.”   5    Table of Contents  In addition to our single-use tests, we sell a line of microwell-based test kits, under the PetChek® name, that are used by larger clinics and laboratories to test multiple samples. PetChek® tests offer accuracy, ease of use and provides cost advantages to high-volume customers. We currently sell PetChek® tests for canine heartworm disease, FIV, and FeLV.  Veterinary Reference Laboratory and Consulting Services  We offer commercial veterinary reference laboratory and consulting services to veterinarians in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan, and South Africa. Veterinarians use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities. Our laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in companion and production animals. This menu of tests includes a number of specialized and proprietary tests that we have developed that allow practitioners to diagnose increasingly relevant diseases in dogs and cats, including heart disease, pancreatitis and certain infectious diseases.  Additionally, we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine and advisory services, including cardiology, radiology, internal medicine and ultrasound consulting. These services permit veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the Internet from the veterinarians’ offices.  Practice Information Systems and Digital Radiography  Practice Information Systems and Services. We develop, market and sell practice information systems, including hardware and software, that run key functions of veterinary clinics, including patient electronic health records management, scheduling (including boarding and grooming), billing, and inventory management. Our principal system is the Cornerstone® system. We also support several legacy systems installed with our customers, including IDEXX Better Choice®, IDEXX VPM™ and IDEXX VetLINK®. Additionally, we provide software and hardware support to our practice information system customers, and related supplies and services to veterinary practice information system users in general, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues for this product line from ongoing service contracts.  Digital Radiography Systems and Services. Our digital radiography systems capture radiograph images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film. Use of digital radiography systems eliminates the need for the film and processor, hazardous chemicals and darkroom required for the production of film images, and provides for image manipulation and enhancement through contrast management. We market and sell three digital radiography systems, the IDEXX-DR™ 1417 and the IDEXX-CR™ 1417 systems for use in the small animal (e.g., dog and cat) veterinary hospital, and the IDEXX EquiView® DR system for use as a portable unit in ambulatory veterinary practices, such as equine practices. Our digital radiography systems use IDEXX-PACS™ and IDEXX EquiView PACS™ picture archiving and communication system (“PACS”) software for the viewing, manipulation, management, storage and retrieval of the digital images generated by the digital capture plate. The PACS software also permits images from our digital radiography systems to be integrated into patients’ medical records in the Cornerstone® system, as well as transferred to other practice information management systems.  WATER  We offer a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological analytes in water.  Our Colilert®, Colilert®-18 and Colisure® tests simultaneously detect total coliforms and E. coli in water. These organisms are broadly used as indicators of microbial contamination in water. These products utilize indicator-nutrients that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled water, recreational water, waste water and water from private wells.   6    Table of Contents  Our Enterolert™ product detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters. Our Quanti-Tray® products, when used in conjunction with our Colilert®, Colilert®-18, Colisure® or Enterolert™ products, provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination, rather than a presence/absence indication. The Colilert®, Colilert®-18, Colisure® and Quanti-Tray® products have been approved by the EPA and by regulatory agencies in certain other countries.  Our Filta-Max® and Filta-Max xpress® products are used in the detection of Cryptosporidium in water. Cryptosporidium is a parasite that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested. Previously, testing of water supplies for Cryptosporidium was mandated by regulation only in England and Wales. Effective January 1, 2009, testing of water supplies for Cryptosporidium is no longer required by regulation in England or Wales. While our customers in these countries may voluntarily continue to test for Cryptosporidium after that date, we expect that beginning in 2009 we will lose sales of Filta-Max® products in England and Wales to customers who have tested solely based on regulatory requirements. Our sales of Filta-Max® products in England and Wales were $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.  In September 2007, we commenced distribution of certain water testing kits manufactured by Invitrogen Corporation (“Invitrogen”). The Invitrogen kits complement our Cryptosporidium and Giardia testing products.  PRODUCTION ANIMAL SEGMENT  We sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to detect a wide range of diseases and to monitor health status in production animals. Our production animal products are purchased primarily by government laboratories and cattle, swine and poultry producers. Our largest product is a post-mortem test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE” or “mad cow disease”). The European Commission recently approved a proposal to revise the monitoring regime for BSE in cattle, which increased the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for BSE from 30 months to 48 months. It has been estimated that revisions will reduce the population of cattle tested by approximately 30%. The revision became effective January 1, 2009 and as a result we believe that we will lose a portion of our sales of our post-mortem test for BSE.  OTHER  Dairy  Our principal product for use in testing for antibiotic residue in milk is the SNAP® Beta-Lactam test. Our primary customers are dairy producers and processors worldwide who use our tests for quality assurance of raw milk.  OPTI Medical Systems  We sell OPTI® point-of-care analyzers and related consumables for use in human medical hospitals and clinics to measure electrolytes, blood gases, acid-base balance, glucose and ionized calcium, and to calculate other parameters such as base excess and anion gap. These analyzers are used primarily in emergency rooms, operating rooms, cardiac monitoring areas and any locations where time-critical diagnostic testing is performed within the hospital setting. The OPTI® CCA and OPTI® Touch Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzers run single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes; the OPTI® R Analyzer runs reusable cassettes in various analyte configurations; and the OPTI® LION Stat Electrolyte Analyzer runs single-use electrolyte cassettes.  Other  We maintain active research and development programs, some of which may materialize into the development and introduction of new technology, products or services that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories. In such situations, the related financial impacts are shown in the Other category. In connection with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business at the end of 2008, we realigned one product line and two out-licensing arrangements from the pharmaceutical business to the Other category. The financial impacts of the product line and out-licensing arrangements have been shown in the Other segment for 2008. The segment information for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2008.   7    Table of Contents  MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION  We market, sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing, sales and technical service groups, as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We maintain sales offices outside the U.S. in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Sales and marketing expense was $170.0 million, $151.9 million and $115.9 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, or 16.6% of sales in 2008, 16.5% of sales in 2007, and 15.7% of sales in 2006.  Generally, we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product, technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory requirements and other factors. We market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the U.S., with most instruments sold directly by IDEXX sales personnel, and rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables supplied primarily by the distribution channel. Outside the U.S., we sell our companion animal diagnostic products through our direct sales force and, in certain countries, through distributors and other resellers. We sell our reference laboratory services worldwide through our direct sales force. We market our software and digital radiography products through our direct sales force primarily in the U.S. We market our water and food diagnostics products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada. Outside the U.S. and Canada, we market these products through selected independent distributors and, in certain countries, through our direct sales force. We sell our OPTI® electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the U.S. and sell most of the related consumables through the distribution channel. Outside the U.S., we sell our OPTI® products primarily through distributors and other resellers.  Our largest customers are our U.S. distributors of our products in the CAG segment. One of our CAG distributors, Butler Animal Health Supply, LLC, accounted for 8% of our 2008 and 2007 revenue, 9% of our 2006 revenue, and 5% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  Our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas. We maintain active research and development programs in each of our business areas. Our research and development expenses, which consist of salaries, employee benefits, materials and consulting costs, were $70.7 million, $67.3 million and $53.6 million, or 6.9% of sales in 2008 and 7.3% of sales in 2007 and 2006.  PATENTS AND LICENSES  We actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies. We also license patents and technologies from third parties.  Important patents and licenses include:       •   An exclusive license from the Regents of the University of California to patents concerning diagnostic products for FIV that expire in June 2009; and other patents covering various reagents, kits and/or immunoassays for detecting FIV antibodies that expire beginning in 2014;         •   Exclusive licenses from Tulane University and the University of Texas to patents and patent applications relating to the detection of Lyme disease that expire beginning in 2019;         •   A patent concerning the Colilert®-18 product that expires in 2014;         •   A patent concerning the Quanti-Tray® product that expires in 2014;         •   A patent that relates to certain methods and kits for simultaneously detecting antigens and antibodies, which covers certain of our SNAP® products, including our canine and feline combination tests, that expires in 2014;         •   An exclusive license from Boehringer Ingelheim to certain patents covering reagents and methods for detecting the PRRS virus that expire beginning in 2012; and         •   An exclusive license from Cornell University to patents covering methods for detecting BVDV that expire beginning in 2017.     8    Table of Contents     To the extent some of our products may now, or in the future, embody technologies protected by patents, copyrights or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”  PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY  Many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third parties, who are in some cases sole source suppliers, to supply us with certain important components, raw materials and consumables used in or with our products.  Significant products supplied by third parties include VetTest® Chemistry Analyzers and consumables, VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzers and consumables, VetLyte® Electrolyte Analyzers and consumables, Coag Dx™ Analyzers and consumables, and Catalyst Dx™ consumables (other than electrolyte consumables).  VetTest® slides and Catalyst Dx™ chemistry slides are supplied by Ortho under supply agreements that expire in 2025 (the “Ortho Agreements”). We are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of VetTest® slides and Catalyst Dx™ chemistry slides from Ortho to the extent Ortho is able to supply those requirements. In addition, we have committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain VetTest® slides and Catalyst Dx™ chemistry slides through 2010.  Other analyzers and consumables are purchased under supply agreements with terms ranging from 1 year to 14 years, which in some cases may be extended at our option. We have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements, and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements.  We purchase certain other products, raw materials and components from a single supplier. These products include certain digital radiography systems and certain components used in our SNAP® rapid assay devices, production animal testing kits, water testing products, and blood analyzers, including our LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzers.  We have in the past been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from single source suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”  We do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales.  COMPETITION  We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to compete with changing technologies, which could affect the marketability of our products and services. Our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products, integrate our products, develop and maintain effective sales channels, attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop and implement production and marketing plans, obtain or license patent rights, and obtain adequate capital resources.  We compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to large human medical diagnostics companies. Our competitors vary in our different markets. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct research activities and may commercialize products, which could compete with our products, on their own or through joint ventures. Some of our competitors have substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than we do.   9    Table of Contents  Competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below:       •   Veterinary diagnostic products and food and water testing products. We compete primarily on the basis of the ease of use, speed, accuracy, quality of the information provided, and other performance characteristics of our products and services (including unique tests), the breadth of our product line and services, the effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, the quality of our technical and customer service, and our pricing relative to the value of our products.         •   Veterinary laboratory and consulting services. In this market, we compete primarily on the basis of quality, consistency of service levels, technology, and our pricing relative to the value of our services. We compete in most geographic locations in North America with Antech Diagnostics, a unit of VCA Antech, Inc.         •   Practice Information Management and Digital Radiography Systems. We compete primarily on the basis of functionality, connectivity to equipment and other systems, performance characteristics, effectiveness of our customer service, information handling capabilities, advances in technologies, and our pricing relative to the value of our products and services.         •   Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzers for the human medical diagnostics point-of-care market. In this market we compete primarily with large human medical diagnostics companies such as Radiometer A/S, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Instrumentation Laboratory, Abbott Diagnostics, and Roche Diagnostics. We compete primarily on the basis of ease of use, menu, convenience, international distribution and service, instrument reliability, and our pricing relative to the value of our products.    GOVERNMENT REGULATION  Many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to, among other things, product approvals, manufacturing, marketing and promotion, recordkeeping, testing, quality, storage, and product disposal. The following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.  Veterinary diagnostic products. Diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases, including most of our production animal products and our rapid assay products, are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”). These products must be approved by APHIS before they may be sold in the U.S. The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A number of foreign governments accept APHIS approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals. However, compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries. We also are required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. We have obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine and our distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee.  Our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the “FDC Act”). While the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the FDA and does not subject us to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“cGMP”), these products must not be adulterated or misbranded under the FDC Act.  These instrument systems also are subject to the European Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device regulations for all European Union (“EU”) member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain European Conformity (“CE”) marking for their products.   10    Table of Contents  Water testing products. Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the U.S. that is required by the EPA, the test must first be approved by the EPA. The EPA approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval. Our Colilert®, Colilert®-18, Colisure®, Quanti-Tray®, Filta-Max® and SimPlate® for heterotropic plate counts (“HPC”) products have been approved by the EPA. The sale of water testing products also is subject to extensive and lengthy regulatory processes in many other countries around the world.  Dairy testing products. Dairy products used in National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (“NCIMS”) milk-monitoring programs, are regulated by the FDA. Before products requiring FDA approval can be sold in the U.S., extensive product performance data must be submitted in accordance with an FDA approved protocol administered by AOAC Research Institute (“AOAC RI”). Following approval of a product by the FDA, the product must also be approved by NCIMS, an oversight body that includes state, federal and industry representatives. Our SNAP® Beta-Lactam dairy antibiotic residue testing product has been approved by the FDA and NCIMS. While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI approval as part of their regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory processes.  Human point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. Our OPTI® instrument systems are classified as Class II medical devices, and their design, manufacture and marketing are regulated by the FDA. Accordingly, we must comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our OPTI® products. The FDA’s Quality System regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records, and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. New OPTI® products fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a 510(k) application.  OPTI® products are also subject to the European Medical Device Directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold.  Any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation. These may involve food, drug, medical device and water-quality regulations of the FDA, the EPA and the USDA, as well as state, local and foreign governments. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”  EMPLOYEES  At December 31, 2008, we had approximately 4,700 full-time and part-time employees.     ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.  Our Failure to Successfully Execute Certain Strategies Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Growth and Profitability  The companion animal health care industry is very competitive and we anticipate increased competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants. Our ability to maintain or enhance our historical growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy, which include:       •   Developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative new in-house laboratory analyzers such as Catalyst Dx™ and SNAPshot Dx® that drive sales of IDEXX VetLab® instruments, grow our installed base of instruments, and create a recurring revenue stream from consumable products;         •   Developing and introducing new proprietary rapid assay and other diagnostic tests and services that effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;         •   Achieving the benefits of economies of scale in our worldwide reference laboratory business;         •   Increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of these products;         •   Growing our market share by strengthening our sales and marketing activities both within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the U.S.; and         •   Developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies; and identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business or geographic areas for us.     11    Table of Contents  If we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of these strategies, our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted.  A Weak Economy Could Result in Reduced Demand for Our Products and Services  A substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market. Demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of pet visits to veterinary hospitals and practices of veterinarians with respect to diagnostic testing. Economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to skip or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or could affect their willingness to treat certain pet health conditions, approve certain diagnostic tests, or continue to own a pet. In addition, concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests. A decline in pet visits to the hospital, in the willingness of pet owners to treat certain health conditions or approve certain tests, in pet ownership, or in the inclination of veterinarians to recommend certain tests could result in a decrease in diagnostic testing, and therefore in our sales of diagnostic products and services.  Disruption in Financial and Currency Markets Could Have a Negative Effect on Our Business  As widely reported, financial markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. These economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. The current tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in orders for our products and services. The inability of pet owners to obtain consumer credit could lead to a decline in pet visits to the veterinarian, which could result in a decrease in diagnostic testing. Likewise, a decrease in diagnostic testing could negatively impact the financial condition of the veterinary practices that are our customers, which may inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided. In addition, although current economic conditions have not impacted our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations, further deterioration in financial markets could adversely affect our access to capital. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries.  Strengthening of the Rate of Exchange for the U.S. Dollar Has a Negative Effect on Our Business  Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the Japanese Yen and the Australian Dollar adversely affects our results, as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the margins on products manufactured in the U.S. and exported to international markets. In 2008, approximately 24% of IDEXX sales were a result of exports from the U.S.  Our Dependence on a Limited Number of Suppliers Could Limit Our Ability to Sell Certain Products or Reduce Our Profitability  We currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products include our VetAutoread™ hematology, VetLyte® electrolyte, IDEXX VetLab® UA™ urinalysis, VetTest® chemistry, and Coag Dx™ blood coagulation analyzers and related consumables and accessories; image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems; and certain components and raw materials used in our SNAP® rapid assay devices, water testing products and LaserCyte® hematology analyzers. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future, we could face cost increases or reductions, delays or discontinuations in product shipments, which could result in our inability to supply the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.   12    Table of Contents  Our Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture, Which Could Negatively Affect Our Ability to Supply the Market  Many of our rapid assay and production animal diagnostic products are biologics, which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex. Unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy (such as most pharmaceuticals), biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials. Difficulty in characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria. Our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Various Government Regulations Could Limit or Delay Our Ability to Market and Sell Our Products  In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the USDA, the FDA and the EPA. Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including our canine, feline, poultry and livestock tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale in the U.S. Our water testing products must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the U.S. as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA. Our dairy testing products require approval by the FDA. The manufacture and sale of our OPTI® line of human point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by the FDA and require approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially in the U.S. The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries. Any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the U.S. or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products from the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.  Our Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Our Proprietary Technologies  We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us.  We cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights. In this regard, we expect that revenues and profit margins associated with sales of our SNAP® FIV/FeLV tests are likely to decline following the expiration in June 2009 of a U.S. patent that we exclusively license that broadly covers products that diagnose feline immunodeficiency virus.  In the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.   13    Table of Contents  Distributor Purchasing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results  We sell many of our products, including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the U.S., through distributors. Distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the end-user demand for our products. In addition, our agreements with distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days notice. Because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors, the loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency, timing or size of distributor purchases, could have a negative effect on our results of operations. Our financial performance, therefore, is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable.  Distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies. Consolidation within distribution channels would increase our customer concentration level, which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph.  Increased Competition and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results  We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies. Competitors may develop products that are superior to our products, and as a result, we may lose existing customers and market share. Some of our competitors and potential competitors, including large diagnostic companies, have substantially greater financial resources than us, and greater experience in manufacturing, marketing, research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do.  Changes in Testing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results  The market for our companion and production animal diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors. The introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing. Changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect. Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Our production animal products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence. In addition, changes in government regulations could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing, such as our production animal, dairy and water products. Declines in testing for any of the reasons described could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Effective January 1, 2009, testing of water supplies for Cryptosporidium is no longer required by regulation in England or Wales. While our customers in these countries may voluntarily continue to test for Cryptosporidium after that date, we expect that beginning in 2009 we will lose sales of Filta-Max® products in England and Wales to customers who have tested solely based on regulatory requirements. Our sales of Filta-Max® products in England and Wales were $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.  Effective January 1, 2009, the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for BSE in the European Union was increased from 30 months to 48 months, which has been estimated to reduce the population of cattle tested by approximately 30%. As a result we believe that we are likely to lose a portion of our sales of our post-mortem test for BSE.  Consolidation of Veterinary Hospitals Could Negatively Affect Our Business  An increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. is owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners in the U.S. include VCA Antech, Inc., National Veterinary Associates, and Banfield, The Pet Hospital, each of which is currently a customer of IDEXX. A similar trend exists in the U.K. and may in the future also develop in other countries. Corporate owners of veterinary hospitals could attempt to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results. In addition, certain corporate owners, most notably VCA Antech, our primary competitor in the U.S. market for reference laboratory services, also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals. Any hospitals acquired by these companies are likely to use their laboratory services almost exclusively. In addition, because these companies compete with us in the laboratory services business, hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services, which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline.   14    Table of Contents  Our Inexperience in the Human Point-of-Care Market Could Inhibit Our Success in this Market  Upon acquiring the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc in January 2007, we entered the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market for the first time with the sale of the OPTI® line of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. The human point-of-care medical diagnostics market differs in many respects from the veterinary medical market. Significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more extensive regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, a more segmented customer base, and more rapid technological innovation. Our inexperience in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary medical market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary medical market.  Risks Associated with Doing Business Internationally Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results  For the year ended December 31, 2008, 40% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales. Possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, import/export duties and quotas, and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets. Prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period. In addition, many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign currencies are manufactured, sourced, or both, in the U.S. and our costs are incurred in U.S. dollars. We utilize non-speculative forward currency exchange contracts and natural hedges to mitigate foreign currency exposure. However, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our operating margins. Additionally, a strengthening U.S. dollar could negatively impact the ability of customers outside the U.S. to pay for purchases denominated in U.S. dollars.  The Loss of Our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Could Adversely Affect Our Business  We rely on the management and leadership of Jonathan W. Ayers, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. We do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for Mr. Ayers. The loss of Mr. Ayers could have a material adverse impact on our business.  We Could Be Subject to Class Action Litigation Due to Stock Price Volatility, which, if it Occurs, Could Result in Substantial Costs or Large Judgments Against Us  The market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.   15    Table of Contents  If Our Quarterly or Annual Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our Stock Price to Decline, Resulting in Losses to You  Our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing of distributor purchases, product launches, operating expenditures, litigation and claim-related expenditures; changes in competitors’ product offerings; changes in the economy affecting consumer spending; and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall.  Future Operating Results Could Be Negatively Affected By the Resolution of Various Uncertain Tax Positions and by Potential Changes to Tax Incentives  In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination was made. Our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions. If we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives, our inability to use these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings.     ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
