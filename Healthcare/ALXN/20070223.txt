Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.  You should carefully consider the following risk factors before you decide to invest in our Company and our business because these risk factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital  If we continue to incur operating losses, we may be unable to continue our operations.  We have incurred losses since we started our company in January 1992. As of December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $638 million. If we continue to incur operating losses and fail to become a profitable company, we may be unable to continue our operations. Since we began our business, we have focused on research and development of product candidates. Although we have submitted for filing a BLA with the FDA in the United States and an MAA in Europe for Soliris™ (eculizumab), we have no products that are available for sale and do not know when we will have products available for sale, if ever. We expect to continue to operate at a net loss for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development efforts, continue to conduct clinical trials and develop manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. Our future profitability depends on our receiving regulatory approval of our product candidates and our ability to successfully manufacture and market approved drugs. The extent and the timing of our future losses and our profitability, if we are ever profitable, are highly uncertain.  If we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to continue or complete our product development.  We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations and product development for at least twelve months. We may need to raise additional capital before or after that time to complete the development and continue the commercialization of our product candidates. We are currently preparing for the commercialization of Soliris™ (eculizumab) and conducting or evaluating several clinical trials. Funding needs may shift between projects and potentially accelerate and increase as we get closer to commercialization of Soliris™ (eculizumab) or if we initiate new clinical trials for our product candidates.  Additional financing could take the form of public or private debt or equity offerings, equity line facilities, bank loans, collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners and/or the sale or licensing of some of our property. The amount of capital we may need depends on many factors, including:        •    the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals;        •    the time and cost necessary to develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;        •    the cost necessary to sell, market and distribute our products, if any are approved;        •    the time and cost necessary to purchase or to further develop manufacturing processes, arrange for contract manufacturing or build manufacturing facilities and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for those facilities;    22    Table of Contents     •    changes in applicable governmental regulatory policies or requests by regulatory agencies for additional information or data;        •    the existence, terms, maintenance, termination and status of collaborative arrangements and strategic partnerships, such as our collaboration with Procter & Gamble, or P&G;        •    the progress, timing and scope of our research and development programs;        •    the progress, timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;        •    any new collaborative, licensing or other commercial relationships that we may establish.  We may not get funding when we need it or funding may only be available on unfavorable terms. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements, we may have to delay, scale-back or eliminate our research and development activities or future operations. We might have to license our technology to others. This could result in sharing revenues that we might otherwise retain for ourselves. Any of these actions would harm our business.  We are significantly leveraged.  On December 31, 2006, we had outstanding $150,000,000 principal amount of 1.375% convertible senior notes. On July 11, 2006, our subsidiary Alexion Manufacturing borrowed $26,000,000 to finance the purchase and construction of our Smithfield, Rhode Island manufacturing facility which may not be prepaid in whole or in part prior to July 11, 2009. The loan is guaranteed by us and bears a fixed annual rate of 9.17%. Our 1.375% convertible senior notes and the mortgage loan remain outstanding, and the degree to which we are leveraged could, among other things:        •    make it difficult for us to make payments on our notes and our loan;        •    make it difficult for us to obtain financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes on favorable terms, if at all;        •    make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures; and        •    limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business.  Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.  Risks Related to Our Business  We depend heavily on the success of our lead product candidate, Soliris™ (eculizumab), which is still under development. If we do not obtain FDA approval of Soliris™ (eculizumab), or if the FDA delays approval or narrows the indications for which we may market Soliris™ (eculizumab), our business will be materially harmed.  We recently submitted for filing a BLA to the FDA in the United States and an MAA in Europe for Soliris™ (eculizumab) for the treatment of PNH. In the near term, our ability to generate revenues will depend on approval and successful commercialization of Soliris™ (eculizumab). The commercial success of Soliris™ (eculizumab) will depend on several factors, including the following:        •    receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;    23    Table of Contents     •    establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities ourselves or through third-party manufacturers;        •    successfully launching commercial sales of the product;        •    the number of patients with PNH that may be treated with the product;        •    acceptance of the product in the medical community; and        •    acceptance of the product’s price by third-party payers.  We may not receive required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. The approval process can involve additional lengthy clinical testing and other costly and time-consuming procedures.  Several biotechnology companies have failed to obtain regulatory approvals because regulatory agencies were not satisfied with the structure or conduct of clinical trials or the formatting or content of regulatory submissions. Similar problems could delay or prevent us from obtaining approvals. Furthermore, regulatory authorities, including the FDA, may not agree with our interpretations of our clinical trial data, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. In addition, before a product candidate is approved for marketing, we, or any third-party manufacturing our product, are subject to inspection of the manufacturing facilities and the FDA will not approve the product for marketing if we or our third-party manufacturers are not in compliance with current good manufacturing practices.  Even if the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities do grant marketing approval for Soliris™ (eculizumab), they may narrow the indications for which we are permitted to market the product, may pose other restrictions on the use or marketing of the product, or may require us to conduct additional post-marketing trials. A narrowed indication or other restrictions may limit the market potential for the product and obligation to conduct additional clinical trials would likely result in increased expenditures and lower revenues. Even where the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies indicate they are prepared to grant marketing approval for Soliris™ (eculizumab), we may choose to continue negotiating for broader indications with fewer restrictions, and such negotiations could cause a delay in marketing approval or could jeopardize the receipt of any marketing approval. If we are not successful in commercializing Soliris™ (eculizumab), or are significantly delayed or limited in doing so, our business will be materially harmed and we may need to curtail or cease operations.  Inability to contract with third-party manufacturers on commercially reasonable terms, or failure or delay by us or our third-party manufacturers, in manufacturing our drug products in the volumes and quality required, would have a material adverse effect on our business.  We have no experience or capacity for manufacturing drug products in volumes that would be necessary to support commercial sales and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully. We depend on a few outside suppliers for manufacturing. Our small, clinical-scale manufacturing plant cannot manufacture enough of our product candidates for later stage clinical development or commercial supply. We do not have the capacity to produce more than one product candidate at a time in that plant. We acquired a commercial-scale manufacturing plant in Smithfield, Rhode Island in July 2006. However, that plant is not currently equipped or approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies to manufacture Soliris™ (eculizumab) or our other drug candidates. We expect that it will be at least two years before the plant is capable of making product for commercial sale. We have no experience in developing commercial-scale manufacturing of the sort anticipated in Smithfield, Rhode Island. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to develop the Smithfield, Rhode Island site into a plant capable of manufacturing our drug products under conditions required by the FDA or     24    Table of Contents  foreign regulatory agencies on a timely basis, if at all. Our plant in Smithfield, Rhode Island will be subject to FDA inspection and approval before we can begin manufacturing Soliris™ (eculizumab) there and will continue to be subject to ongoing FDA inspections thereafter. Our Smithfield, Rhode Island plant will also be subject to European regulatory inspection and approval before we can begin manufacturing Soliris™ (eculizumab) there for European sales and will continue to be subject to ongoing European regulatory inspection thereafter.  We have executed a commercial-scale product supply agreement with Lonza for the long-term manufacture of eculizumab. The failure of Lonza to manufacture appropriate supplies of eculizumab on a timely basis, or at all, may prevent or impede the commercialization of Soliris™ (eculizumab). If eculizumab is approved for sale, we expect that Lonza or we would be required to manufacture substantially more material than we have required for clinical and preclinical trials. We and our outside manufacturers may experience higher manufacturing failure rates than in the past if and when we attempt to substantially increase production volume. If we experience interruptions in the manufacture of our products, our drug development and commercialization efforts will be delayed. If any of our outside manufacturers stops manufacturing our products or reduces the amount manufactured, or is otherwise unable to manufacture our required amounts at our required quality, we will need to find other alternatives, which is likely to be expensive and time consuming, and even if we are able to find alternatives they may ultimately be insufficient for our needs. As a result, our ability to conduct testing and drug trials and our plans for commercialization would be materially adversely affected. Submission of products and new development programs for regulatory approval, as well as our plans for commercialization, would be delayed. Our competitive position and our prospects for achieving profitability would be materially and adversely affected.  Manufacture of drug products, including the need to develop and utilize manufacturing processes that consistently produce our drug products to their required quality specifications, is highly regulated by the FDA and other domestic and foreign authorities. Regulatory authorities must approve the facilities in which our products are manufactured prior to granting market approval for any product candidate. Manufacturing facilities are also subject to ongoing inspections, and minor changes in manufacturing processes may require additional regulatory approvals. We cannot assure you that we or our third-party collaborators will successfully comply with all of those requirements and regulations, which failure would have a materially adverse effect on our business.  Manufacture of our drug products is highly technical and only a few third-parties have the ability and capacity to manufacture our drug products for our development and commercialization needs. We cannot assure you that these potential third-party collaborators will agree to manufacture our products on our behalf on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we do achieve agreement from one or more third parties to manufacture our drug products, we cannot assure you that they will be able or willing to honor the terms of the agreements, including any obligations to manufacture the drug products in accordance with regulatory requirements and to our quality specifications and volume requirements. Due to the highly technical requirements of manufacturing our drug products, our third-party collaborators and we may be unable to manufacture our drug products despite their and our efforts.  Due to the nature of the current market for third-party commercial manufacturing, many arrangements require substantial penalty payments by the customer for failure to use the manufacturing capacity for which it contracted. We could owe substantial penalty payments to Lonza if we were not to use the manufacturing capacity for which we contracted. Penalty payments under these agreements typically decrease over the life of     25    Table of Contents  the agreement, and may be substantial initially and de minims or non-existent in the final period. The payment of a substantial penalty would harm our financial condition.  If we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so, we will be unable to successfully market and sell future drug products.  We have no experience with marketing, sales and distribution of drug products and have only recently established pre-commercial capability in those areas. If we are unable to establish capabilities to sell, market and distribute our products, either by developing our own capabilities or entering into agreements with others, we will not be able to successfully sell Soliris™ (eculizumab) or our future drug products. In that event, we will not be able to generate significant revenues. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to hire the qualified sales and marketing personnel we need. We may not be able to enter into any marketing or distribution agreements with third-party providers on acceptable terms, if at all.  If we are unable to obtain reimbursement for our future products from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, our products may be too costly for regular use and our ability to generate revenues would be harmed.  Soliris™ (eculizumab), if commercialized, is likely to be significantly more expensive than traditional drug treatments. Our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected if we cannot depend on governmental, private third-party payers and other third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid, to defray the cost of Soliris™ (eculizumab) to the consumer. If these entities refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement with respect to Soliris™ (eculizumab) or determine to provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement, Soliris™ (eculizumab) may be too costly for general use, and physicians may not prescribe it. Many third-party payers cover only selected drugs, making drugs that are not preferred by such payer more expensive for patients, and require prior authorization or failure on another type of treatment before covering a particular drug. Third-party payers may be especially likely to impose these obstacles to coverage for higher-priced drugs, which we anticipate Soliris™ (eculizumab) to be.  In addition to potential restrictions on coverage, the amount of reimbursement for our products may also reduce our profitability and worsen our financial condition. In the United States and elsewhere, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, actions and proposals to control and reduce healthcare costs. Government and other third-party payers are challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and increasingly limiting and attempting to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for prescription drugs.  Since Soliris™ (eculizumab) will likely be too expensive for most patients to afford without health insurance coverage, if adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payers is not available, our ability to successfully commercialize Soliris™ (eculizumab) may be adversely impacted. Any limitation on the use of Soliris™ (eculizumab) or any decrease in the price of Soliris™ (eculizumab) will have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve profitability.  Even where patients have access to insurance, their insurance co-payment amounts may be too expensive for them to afford. We anticipate that Alexion will financially support charitable organizations whose mission is to assist patients in acquiring drugs such as Soliris™ (eculizumab). Those charitable organizations may assist patients who have no insurance coverage for drugs or whose insurance coverage leaves them with prohibitive co-payment amounts or other expensive financial obligations. In addition, we anticipate that Alexion will provide     26    Table of Contents  Soliris™ (eculizumab) without charge for related charitable purposes. We are not able to predict the financial impact of the support we may provide for these and other charitable purposes; however, substantial support could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve profitability.  In certain foreign countries, pricing, coverage and level of reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control and we may be unable to negotiate coverage, pricing, and reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us. In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Our results of operation may suffer if we are unable to market our products in foreign countries or if coverage and reimbursement for our products in foreign countries is limited.  If the testing or use of our products harms people, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to our products, our clinical trials may be adversely affected, our regulatory approval process could be delayed, negatively impacted or abandoned, any regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted, and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.  The testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of drugs for use in humans exposes us to product liability risks. Side effects and other problems from using our products could cause serious adverse events and give rise to product liability claims against us. We might have to withdraw or recall our products from the marketplace. Some of these risks are unknown at this time.  We have tested Soliris™ (eculizumab) in only a small number of patients. If our applications for marketing Soliris™ (eculizumab) are approved and more patients begin to use our product, new risks and side effects associated with Soliris™ (eculizumab) may be discovered, and risks previously viewed as inconsequential could be determined to be significant. As a result, regulatory authorities may delay or revoke their approvals; we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, make changes in labeling of our product, reformulate our product or make changes and obtain new approvals for our and our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities. We may also experience a significant drop in the potential sales of our product if and when regulatory approvals for Soliris™ (eculizumab) are obtained, experience harm to our reputation in the marketplace or become subject to lawsuits, including class actions. Any of these results could decrease or prevent any sales of Soliris™ (eculizumab) or substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing Soliris™ (eculizumab).  We may be sued by people who participate in our trials or who use our products. Many patients who participate in our trials or use our products are already very ill. Any informed consents or waivers obtained from people who enroll in our trials or use our products may not protect us from liability or litigation. Our product liability insurance may not cover all potential types of liabilities or may not cover covered types of liabilities completely. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms. In addition, negative publicity relating to the use of our product or to a product liability claim may make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to recruit patients for our clinical trials or to market and sell our products. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.    27    Table of Contents Our clinical trials are often conducted with patients who have severe and advanced stages of disease when they enter our trials. Patients involved in clinical trials such as ours often have known as well as unknown significant pre-existing health risks. During the course of a trial, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may or may not be related to our products. Such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients or delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive regulatory approval to market our products. Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to our product, the investigation into the circumstance may be time consuming or may be inconclusive. These investigations may delay our regulatory approval process, impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our products receive, or end our opportunity to receive regulatory approval. PNH patients in our trials sometimes have additional, pre-existing, potentially life-threatening disease, including for example bone marrow failure.  Some patients who have participated in our PNH trials have died or suffered potentially life-threatening diseases either during or after ending study-specified treatments. In particular, use of C5 Inhibitors, such as eculizumab, is associated with an increased risk for infection with Neisseria bacteria. Serious cases of Neisseria infection can result in severe illness, including but not limited to brain damage, loss of limbs or parts of limbs, kidney failure, or death. PNH patients in our TRIUMPH and SHEPHERD trials all received vaccination against the Neisseria bacteria prior to first administration of eculizumab; however, vaccination does not eliminate all risk of becoming infected with Neisseria bacteria. Some patients in our trials of eculizumab for the treatment of PNH and other diseases have become infected with Neisseria bacteria, including PNH patients in the open-label extension trial E05-001 who had been vaccinated against Neisseria bacteria. Each such incident has been reported to appropriate regulatory agencies in accordance with relevant regulations.  We are also aware of a potential risk for PNH patients who delay a dose of Soliris™ (eculizumab) or discontinue their treatment of Soliris™ (eculizumab). Treatment with Soliris™ (eculizumab) blocks complement and allows complement-sensitive PNH red blood cells to increase in number. If treatment with Soliris™ (eculizumab) is thereafter delayed or discontinued, a greater number of red blood cells therefore would become susceptible to destruction when the patient’s complement system is no longer blocked. The rapid destruction of a larger number of a patient’s red blood cells may lead to numerous complications, including death. Several PNH patients in our studies of Soliris™ (eculizumab) have received delayed doses or discontinued their treatment. In none of those circumstances were complications from rapid destruction of a larger number of PNH red blood cells observed to be significant; however, we have not studied the delay or termination of treatment in enough patients to determine that complications in the future are unlikely to occur. Determination of significant complications associated with the delay or discontinuation of Soliris™ (eculizumab) could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell eculizumab for PNH.  If we are unable to engage and retain third-party collaborators, our research and development efforts may be delayed.  We depend upon third-party collaborators to assist us in the development of our product candidates. If any of our existing collaborators breaches or terminates its agreement with us or does not perform its development work under an agreement in a timely manner, or at all, we would experience significant delays in the development or commercialization of our product candidates. We would also experience significant delays if we could not engage additional collaborators when required. In either event, we would be required to devote additional funds or other resources to these activities or to terminate them. Either of these events would divert funds or other resources from other parts of our business.    28    Table of Contents We cannot assure you that:        •    our current collaboration arrangements will continue in their current form;        •    we will be able to negotiate acceptable collaborative agreements to develop or commercialize our product candidates;        •    any arrangements with third parties will be successful; or        •    current or potential collaborators will not pursue treatments for other diseases or seek other ways of developing treatments for our disease targets.  If our competitors get to the marketplace before we do with better or cheaper drugs, our drugs may not be profitable to sell or to continue to develop.  Each of Adprotech Ltd., Avant Immunotherapeutics, Inc., Tanox, Inc., XOMA, Ltd., Novo Nordisk A/S and Archemix Corporation have publicly announced their intentions to develop drugs which target the inflammatory effects of complement in the immune system. We are also aware that Abbott Laboratories, Inc., Baxter International, Inc., Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Neurogen Corporation, have had programs develop complement inhibitor therapies. Each of AstraZeneca, MorphoSys AG and Dyax Corporation has publicly announced intentions to develop therapeutic human antibodies from libraries of human antibody genes. Additionally, each of Amgen, Inc. and Medarex, Inc. has publicly announced intentions to develop therapeutic human antibodies from mice that have been bred to include some human antibody genes. These and other pharmaceutical companies, many of which have significantly greater resources than we, may develop, manufacture, and market better or cheaper drugs than our product candidates. They may establish themselves in the marketplace even before we are able to finish our clinical trials. Other pharmaceutical companies also compete with us to attract academic research institutions as drug development partners, including for licensing these institutions’ proprietary technology. If our competitors successfully enter into such arrangements with academic institutions, we will be precluded from pursuing those unique opportunities and may not be able to find equivalent opportunities elsewhere.  If we fail to recruit and retain personnel, our research and product development programs may be delayed.  We are highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior management and scientific personnel, particularly Dr. Leonard Bell, M.D., our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, David W. Keiser, our President, Chief Operating Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, and Stephen P. Squinto, Ph.D., our Executive Vice President and Head of Research. There is intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified scientific and technical personnel. Since our business is very science-oriented and specialized, we need to continue to attract and retain such people. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business. We have employment agreements with Dr. Bell, Mr. Keiser, and Dr. Squinto. None of our key personnel is nearing retirement age or to our knowledge, planning to retire. To our knowledge, there is no tension between any of our key personnel and the Board of Directors. If we lose the services of our management and scientific personnel and fail to recruit other scientific and technical personnel, our research and product development programs will be materially and adversely affected.  In particular, we highly value the services of Dr. Bell, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of his services could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our objectives.    29    Table of Contents We are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.  We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including the handling and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes, including medical and biological wastes, and emissions and discharges into the environment, including air, soils and water sources. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating its property or locations to which wastes were sent from its facilities, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or necessarily caused, the contamination. Such obligations and liabilities, which to date have not been material, could have a material impact on our business and financial condition.  We may expand our business through acquisitions that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.  Our business strategy includes expanding our products and capabilities, and we may seek acquisitions to do so. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:        •    substantial cash expenditures;        •    potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities;        •    incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify at the time of acquisition;        •    difficulties in assimilating the operations of the acquired companies;        •    diverting our management’s attention away from other business concerns;        •    risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience; and        •    the potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies.  We cannot assure you that any acquisition will result in short-term or long-term benefits to us. We may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business. In addition, our future success would depend in part on our ability to manage the rapid growth associated with some of these acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to make the combination of our business with that of acquired businesses or companies work or be successful. Furthermore, the development or expansion of our business or any acquired business or companies may require a substantial capital investment by us. We may not have these necessary funds or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. We may also seek to raise funds by selling shares of our capital stock, which could dilute current stockholders’ ownership interest in our company, or securities convertible into our capital stock, which could dilute current stockholders’ ownership interest in our company upon conversion.  Our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited if there is a change in ownership of Alexion.  As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $618 million of net operating loss carry forwards, or NOLs, available to reduce taxable income in future years. We believe that some of these NOLs are currently subject to an annual limitation under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.    30    Table of Contents Our ability to utilize our NOLs may be further limited if we undergo an ownership change, as defined in section 382, as a result of subsequent changes in the ownership of our outstanding stock. We would undergo an ownership change if, among other things, the stockholders, or group of stockholders, who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the value of our stock, or are otherwise treated as 5% stockholders under section 382 and the regulations promulgated there under, increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of our stock owned by these stockholders at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding the potential ownership change. In the event of an ownership change, section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre-ownership change NOLs. The limitation imposed by section 382 for any post-change year would be determined by multiplying the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. Any unused limitation may be carried over to later years, and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by built-in gains which may be present with respect to assets held by us at the time of the ownership change that are recognized in the five-year period after the ownership change. Our use of NOLs arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected.  Risks Related to Our Industry  We are subject to extensive government regulation, and, if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approvals, we will not be able to sell our drug products.  We and our partners cannot sell or market our products without regulatory approval. If we or our partners do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products, the value of our company and our results of operations will be harmed. In the United States, we or our partners must obtain and maintain approval from the FDA for each indication for each drug that we intend to sell and for each facility where such drug is manufactured. Obtaining FDA approval is typically a lengthy and expensive process, and approval is highly uncertain. Foreign governments also regulate drugs distributed outside the United States and facilities outside the United States where such drugs are manufactured, and obtaining their approvals can also be lengthy, expensive and highly uncertain. The approval process varies from country to country and the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product manufacturing, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. In certain foreign jurisdictions we would be required to obtain pricing approvals prior to marketing our products. None of our product candidates has received regulatory approval to be marketed and sold in the United States or any other country. We may not receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates for at least the next several years, if ever.  We and our partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers are subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by the FDA, other federal and state agencies, and governmental authorities in other countries. These regulations apply both before and after approval of our product candidates, if our product candidates are ever approved, and cover, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, advertising, promotion, and export of biologics. As a condition of approval for marketing our product, FDA, or governmental authorities in other countries may require us to conduct additional clinical trials. Our manufacturing and other facilities and those of any third parties manufacturing our products will be subject to inspection prior to grant of marketing approval and subject to continued review and periodic inspections by the regulatory authorities. Any third party we would use to manufacture our products for sale must also be licensed by applicable regulatory authorities. Failure to     31    Table of Contents  comply with the laws, including statutes and regulations, administered by the FDA or other agencies could result in:        •    administrative and judicial sanctions, including, warning letters;        •    fines and other civil penalties;        •    delays in approving or refusal to approve a product candidate;        •    withdrawal of a previously granted approval;        •    product recall or seizure;        •    interruption of production;        •    operating restrictions;        •    injunctions; and        •    criminal prosecution.  The discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the facility used to produce the product could result in a regulatory authority imposing restrictions on us, or could cause us to voluntarily adopt such restrictions, including withdrawal of one or more of our products or services from the market.  We may be unable to obtain necessary regulatory approvals in the United States and foreign countries on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our product candidates or maintain such approvals if obtained. Any delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals or failure to maintain them could prevent us from marketing our products.  The FDA has granted orphan drug designation for eculizumab in the treatment of PNH and membranous nephritis. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the FDA review and approval process. If a product which has an orphan drug designation is the first drug of its type to receive FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, i.e., the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances.  If our drug trials are delayed or achieve unfavorable results, we will have to delay or may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our products.  We must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates before we can obtain regulatory approval for our products. We need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and clinical human trials. These tests and trials may not achieve favorable results. The FDA typically requires two well controlled clinical trials that demonstrate efficacy in order to obtain FDA approval to market a product candidate. The special protocol assessment for our development of Soliris™ (eculizumab) for PNH provides for only a single efficacy trial and the FDA has indicated that the trials should provide compelling evidence of clinically meaningful benefit in order to warrant consideration for marketing approval. The FDA has noted that a study that is merely statistically positive may not provide the evidence necessary to support filing or approval of a product candidate.  The FDA and other regulatory agencies may require additional information or data prior to and after acceptance of our BLA and MAA for Soliris™ (eculizumab) for PNH. We may have to conduct additional lengthy clinical testing and other costly and time-consuming procedures. Inconclusive or negative final data from     32    Table of Contents  our 12 month Phase III SHEPHERD trial would have a significant negative impact on our prospects. Even if we view the data as positive, the FDA may not agree with our interpretations of our clinical trial data for Soliris™ (eculizumab) and may decide that our results are not adequate to support approval for marketing of Soliris™ (eculizumab). In those circumstances, we would not be able to obtain regulatory approval on a timely basis, if ever. Even if approval is granted, the approval may require limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed. In addition to the FDA and other regulatory agency regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials, marketing and approval for drugs, and commercial sales and distribution of drugs in foreign countries. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval as well as country-specific regulations. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries.  Completion of clinical trials does not guarantee advancement to the next phase of development.  Completion of clinical trials does not guarantee that we will initiate additional trials for our product candidates, that if the trials are initiated what the scope and phase of the trial will be or that they will be completed, or that if the trials are completed, that the results will provide a sufficient basis to proceed with further trials or to apply for or receive regulatory approvals or to commercialize products. Results of trials could be inconclusive, requiring additional or repeat trials. If the results achieved in our clinical trials are insufficient to proceed to further trials or to regulatory approval of our product candidates, our company could be materially adversely affected. Failure of a trial to achieve its pre-specified primary endpoint generally increases the likelihood that additional studies will be required if we determine to continue development of the product candidate, reduces the likelihood of timely development of and regulatory approval to market the product candidate, and may decrease the chances for successfully achieving the primary endpoint in scientifically similar indications.  There are many reasons why drug testing could be delayed or terminated.  For human trials, patients must be recruited and each product candidate must be tested at various doses and formulations for each clinical indication. In addition, to ensure safety and effectiveness, the effect of drugs often must be studied over a long period of time, especially for the chronic diseases that we are studying. Unfavorable results or insufficient patient enrollment in our clinical trials could delay or cause us to abandon a product development program. We may decide to abandon development of a product candidate at any time, or we may have to spend considerable resources repeating clinical trials or conducting additional trials, either of which would increase costs and delay any revenue from those product candidates, if any.  Additional factors that can cause delay, impairment or termination of our clinical trials or our product development efforts include:        •    slow patient enrollment, including for example due to the rarity of the disease being studied;        •    long treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness;        •    lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate;        •    disruption of operations at the clinical trial sites;        •    adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients;    33    Table of Contents     •    the failure of patients taking the placebo to continue to participate in our clinical trials;        •    insufficient clinical trial data to support effectiveness of the product candidates;        •    lack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested;        •    lack of sufficient funds;        •    inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product candidate for development or commercialization activities in a timely and cost-efficient manner; or        •    failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the product candidate or the approvals for the facilities in which such product candidate is manufactured.  Risks Related to Intellectual Property  If we cannot protect the confidentiality and proprietary nature of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position will be harmed.  Our business requires using sensitive technology, techniques and proprietary compounds that we protect as trade secrets. However, since we are a small company, we also rely heavily on collaboration with suppliers, outside scientists and other drug companies. Collaboration presents a strong risk of exposing our trade secrets. If our trade secrets were exposed, it would help our competitors and adversely affect our business prospects.  In order to protect our drugs and technology more effectively, we need to obtain and maintain patents covering the drugs and technologies we develop. We may obtain patents through ownership or license. Our drugs are expensive and time-consuming to test and develop. Without patent protection, competitors may copy our methods, or the chemical structure or other aspects of our drugs. Even if we obtain and maintain patents, the patents may not be broad enough to protect our drugs from copycat products.  If we are found to be infringing on patents owned by others, we may be forced to pay damages to the patent owner and obtain a license to continue the manufacture, sale or development of our drugs and/or pay damages. If we cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from the manufacture, sale or development of our drugs.  Parts of our technology, techniques and proprietary compounds and potential drug candidates, including those which are in-licensed, may be found to infringe patents owned by or granted to others. If we cannot resolve these conflicts, we may be liable for damages, be required to obtain costly licenses or be stopped from manufacturing, using or selling our products or conducting other activities. For example, we are aware of broad patents owned by others relating to the manufacture, use and sale of recombinant humanized antibodies, recombinant humanized single chain antibodies, recombinant human antibodies, and recombinant human single chain antibodies. Many of our product candidates, including our lead product candidate, eculizumab, are either genetically engineered antibodies, including recombinant humanized antibodies, recombinant humanized single chain antibodies, recombinant human antibodies, or recombinant human single chain antibodies.  We have received notices from the owners of some of these patents claiming that their patents may be infringed by the development, manufacture or sale of some of our drug candidates, including eculizumab. We are also aware of other patents owned by third parties that might be claimed to be infringed by the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates, including eculizumab. In respect to some of these patents, we     34    Table of Contents  have obtained licenses, or expect to obtain licenses. However, with regard to other patents, we have either determined in our judgment that:        •    we believe our products do not infringe the patents;        •    we do not believe the patents are valid; or        •    we have identified and are testing various modifications that we believe should not infringe the patents and which should permit commercialization of our product candidates.  Any holder of these patents or other patents covering similar technology could sue us for damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing, selling or developing our drugs. Legal disputes can be costly and time consuming to defend. If any patent holder successfully challenges our judgment that our products do not infringe their patents or that their patents are invalid, we could be required to pay costly damages or to obtain a license to sell or develop our drugs. A required license may be costly or may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. A costly license, or inability to obtain a necessary license, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  There can be no assurance that we would prevail in a patent infringement action; will be able to obtain a license to any third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms; successfully develop non-infringing alternatives on a timely basis; or license alternative non-infringing technology, if any exists, on commercially reasonable terms. Any impediment to our ability to manufacture or sell approved forms of our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.  Risks Related to Our Common Stock  If the trading price of our common stock continues to fluctuate in a wide range, our stockholders will suffer considerable uncertainty with respect to an investment in our common stock.  The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Factors such as announcements of fluctuations in our or our competitors’ operating results or clinical or scientific results, fluctuations in the trading prices or business prospects of our competitors and collaborators, changes in our prospects, particularly with respect to regulatory approval of Soliris™ (eculizumab), and market conditions for biotechnology stocks in general could have a significant impact on the future trading prices of our common stock and our convertible senior notes. In particular, the trading price of the common stock of many biotechnology companies, including ours, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies whose stocks were affected. This is due to several factors, including general market conditions, the announcement of the results of our clinical trials or product development and the results of our attempts to obtain FDA approval for our products. In particular, since August 1, 1999, the sales price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $9.05 per share to a high of $119.88 per share. While we cannot predict our future performance, if our stock price continues to fluctuate in a wide range, an investment in our common stock may result in considerable uncertainty for an investor.  Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, provisions in our charter and bylaws and our stockholders’ rights plan, or poison pill, could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult and may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current management.  Because we are a Delaware corporation, the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to     35    Table of Contents  stockholders. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Laws, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.  Our corporate charter and by-law provisions and stockholder rights plan may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control that might be beneficial to Alexion or its stockholders. Our bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Secretary, or a majority of the Board of Directors, or upon the written request of stockholders who together own of record 50% of the outstanding stock of all classes entitled to vote at such meeting. Our bylaws also specify that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors. Our certificate does not include a provision for cumulative voting for directors, which may have enabled a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares to elect one or more directors. Under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to designate up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future.  Pursuant to our stockholder rights plan, each share of common stock has an associated preferred stock purchase right. The rights will not trade separately from the common stock until, and are exercisable only upon, the acquisition or the potential acquisition through tender offer by a person or group of 20% or more of the outstanding common stock. The rights are designed to make it more likely that all of our stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of us and to guard against the use of partial tender offers or other coercive tactics to gain control of us.  These provisions could delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us or our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices. These provisions could also limit the ability of stockholders to remove current management or approve transactions that stockholders may deem to be in their best interests and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
