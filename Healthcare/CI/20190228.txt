ITEM 1A. Risk Factors             ITEM 1A. Risk Factors       As a large global health service company operating in a complex industry, we encounter a variety of risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or the trading price of our securities. You should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties discussed below, together with other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us. The following risk factors have been organized by category for ease of use; however many of the risks may have impacts in more than one category. These categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. Risk factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance.          Strategic and Operational Risks         Future performance of our business will depend on our ability to execute our strategic and operational initiatives effectively.  The future performance of our business will depend in large part on our ability to effectively implement and execute our strategic and operational initiatives. Successfully executing on these initiatives depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:  • differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;  • develop and introduce new and innovative products or programs, particularly in response to government regulation and the increased focus on consumer-directed products;  • grow our commercial product portfolio;  • identify and introduce the proper mix or integration of products that will be accepted by the marketplace;   • identify products and solutions that focus on improving patient outcomes and assist in controlling costs;   • evaluate drugs for efficacy, value and price to assist clients in selecting a cost-effective formulary;   • offer cost-effective home delivery pharmacy and specialty services;  • leverage purchase volume to deliver discounts to health benefit providers;  • attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees;  • attract, develop and maintain collaborative relationships with a sufficient number of qualified partners;   • attract new and maintain existing customer and client relationships;  • transition health care providers from volume-based fee-for-service arrangements to a value-based system;   • improve medical cost competitiveness in our targeted markets;  • manage our medical, pharmacy, administrative, and other operating costs effectively; and  • contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacy providers on favorable terms.  For our strategic initiatives to succeed, we must effectively integrate our operations, including with Express Scripts and other acquired businesses, actively work to ensure consistency throughout the organization, and promote a global mind-set along with a focus on individual customers and clients. If we fail to do so, our business may be unable to grow as planned, or the result of expansion may be unsatisfactory. We will be unable to rapidly respond to competitive, economic and regulatory changes if we do not make important strategic and operational decisions quickly, define our appetite for risk specifically, implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes smoothly and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly. If these initiatives fail or are not executed on effectively, our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be negatively affected.    We operate in a highly competitive, evolving and rapidly changing industry and our failure to adapt could negatively impact our business.  The health service industry continues to be dynamic and rapidly evolving. Any significant shifts in the structure of the industry could alter industry dynamics and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients. Industry shifts could result (and have resulted) from, among other things:  • a large intra- or inter-industry merger or industry consolidation;  • strategic alliances;  • new or alternative business models;  • continuing consolidation among physicians, hospitals and other health care providers, as well as changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians, hospitals and health care providers;  • new market entrants, including those not traditionally in the health service industry;  • the ability of larger employers and clients to contract directly with providers;     ​ 26 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2018 Form 10-K   ​    ​          Back to Contents PART I ITEM 1A. Risk Factors  • technological changes and rapid shifts in the use of technology, such as telemedicine;  • the impact or consequences of legislation or regulatory changes;  • changes in the United States Postal Service or the consolidation of shipping carriers;  • increased drug acquisition cost or unexpected changes to drug pricing trend;  • change in the generic drug market or the failure of new generic drugs to come to market;  • a general decrease in drug utilization; or  • a general increase in utilization under risk-based contracts in the medical benefit management market.  Our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes in the industry could negatively impact our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.    Our failure to compete effectively to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors and maintain or increase market share could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  We operate in a highly competitive environment and an industry subject to significant market pressures brought about by customer and client needs, legislative and regulatory developments and other market factors. In particular markets, our competitors may have greater, better or more established capabilities, resources, market share, reputation or business relationships, or lower profit margin or financial return expectations. Our clients are well informed and organized and can easily move between our competitors and us. Our Express Scripts client contracts generally have three-year terms. As described in greater detail in the description of our business in Item 1 above (see page 11 of this Form 10-K), one of our key clients in the Health Services segment is the United States Department of Defense. If one or more of our large clients either terminates or does not renew a contract for any reason, including as a result of being acquired, or if the provisions of a contract with a large client are modified, renewed or otherwise changed with terms less favorable to us, our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could experience a negative reaction in the investment community resulting in decreases in the trading price of our securities or other adverse effects.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to compete effectively in our markets, set prices appropriately in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share, increase customers as planned, differentiate our business offerings by innovating and delivering products and services that provide enhanced value to our customers, provide quality and satisfactory levels of service, and retain accounts with favorable medical cost experience or more profitable products versus retaining or increasing our customer base in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience or less profitable products.  We must remain competitive to attract new customers, retain existing customers, and further integrate additional product and service offerings. To succeed in this highly competitive marketplace, it is imperative we maintain a strong reputation. The negative reputational impact of a significant event, including a failure to execute on customer or client contracts or strategic or operational initiatives, or failure to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate greater value to our customers, could affect our ability to grow and retain profitable arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.    We face price competition and other pressures that could compress our margins or result in premiums that are insufficient to cover the cost of services delivered to our customers.  While we compete on the basis of many service and quality-related factors, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. Our client contracts are subject to negotiation as clients seek to contain their costs, including by reducing benefits offered. Increasingly, our clients seek to negotiate performance guarantees that require us to pay penalties if the guaranteed performance standard is not met. Clients can easily move between our competitors and us. Our clients are well-informed and typically have knowledgeable consultants that seek competing bids from our competitors before contract renewal. In addition, as brokers and benefit consultants seek to enhance their revenue streams, they look to take on services that we typically provide. Each of these events could negatively impact our financial results.  Further, federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict our ability to implement changes in premium rates. Fiscal or other concerns related to the government-sponsored programs in which we participate, such as Medicare, may cause decreasing reimbursement rates, delays in premium payments or insufficient increases in reimbursement rates. Any limitation on our ability to maintain or increase our premium or reimbursement levels, or a significant loss of customers or clients resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels, could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  Premiums in the Integrated Medical segment are generally set for one-year periods and are priced well in advance of the date on which the contract commences or renews. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted mid-year in the year before the contract year. Although we base the premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the contract period, actual costs may exceed what we estimate in setting premiums. Our health care costs also are affected by external events that we cannot forecast or project and over which we have little or no control, as well as changes in customers' health care utilization patterns and provider billing practices. Our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accurately predict, price for and effectively manage future health care costs. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenue can result in significant changes in our financial results.  Strong competition within the pharmacy benefit business has also generated greater demand for lower product and service pricing, increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings. These competitive factors have historically applied pressure on our operating margins and caused many companies, including us, to reduce the prices charged for products and services while sharing with clients a greater portion of the formulary fees and related rebates received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our inability to maintain positive trends, or     ​    ​    ​ CIGNA CORPORATION - 2018 Form 10-K 27          Back to Contents PART I ITEM 1A. Risk Factors failure to identify and implement new ways to mitigate pricing pressures, could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients or sell additional services, which could negatively impact our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.    The reserves we hold for expected medical claims are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable. If actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially adversely affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to contain future costs may be limited.  We maintain and record medical claims reserves on our balance sheet for estimated future payments. Our estimates of health care costs payable are based on a number of factors, including historical claim experience, but this estimation process requires extensive judgment. Considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns and/or procedures, changes in customer base and product mix, changes in the utilization of medical and/or other covered services, changes in medical cost trends, changes in our medical management practices and the introduction of new benefits and products. If we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited. Because establishing these reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing medical claims reserves.    If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health service providers, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.  We contract with physicians, hospitals and other health service providers and facilities to provide health services to our customers. Our results of operations are substantially dependent on our ability to contract for these services at competitive prices. In any particular market, physicians, hospitals and health service providers may enter into exclusive arrangements with competitors or simply refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or less desirable products or services for our customers. In some markets, certain providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations and multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant or controlling market positions that could result in a diminished bargaining position for us. If providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate more favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. Establishing collaborative arrangements with physician groups, specialist groups, independent practice associations, hospitals and health care delivery systems is key to our strategic focus to transition from volume-based fee-for-service arrangements to a value-based health care system. If such collaborative arrangements do not result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract health care providers to such arrangements, or are less successful at implementing such arrangements than our competitors, our attractiveness to customers may be reduced and our ability to profitably grow our business may be adversely affected.  Our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with providers may also be negatively impacted by other factors not associated with us, such as changes in Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement levels, increasing pressure on revenue and other pressures on health care providers and increasing consolidation activity among hospitals, physician groups and providers. Continuing consolidation among physicians, hospitals and other providers, the emergence of accountable care organizations, vertical integration of providers and other entities, changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians, hospitals and providers and new market entrants, including those not traditionally in the health care industry, may affect the way providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape in which we operate. In some instances, these organizations may compete directly with us, potentially affecting the way we price our products and services or cause us to incur increased costs if we change our operations to be more competitive.  Out-of-network providers are not limited by any agreement with us in the amounts they bill. While benefit plans place limits on the amount of charges that will be considered for reimbursement, out-of-network providers have become increasingly sophisticated and aggressive and such limitations can be difficult to enforce. As a result, the outcome of disputes where we do not have a provider contract may cause us to pay higher medical or other benefit costs than we projected.    If we lose our relationship with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers, or if the payments made or discounts provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.  We maintain contractual relationships with numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers, which provide us with, among other things:  • discounts for drugs we purchase to be dispensed from our home delivery and specialty pharmacies;  • discounts, in the form of rebates, for drug utilization;  • fees for administering rebate programs, including invoicing, allocating and collecting rebates;  • fees for services provided to pharmaceutical manufacturers by our specialty pharmacies; and  • access to limited distribution specialty pharmaceuticals by our specialty pharmacies.  Our contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers are typically non-exclusive and terminable on relatively short notice by either party. The consolidation of pharmaceutical manufacturers, the termination or material alteration of our contractual relationships, or our failure to renew such contracts on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, arrangements between payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers have been the subject of debate in federal and state legislatures and various other public and governmental forums. Adoption of new laws, rules or regulations or changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, rules or regulations, relating to any of these programs could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.     ​ 28 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2018 Form 10-K   ​    ​          Back to Contents PART I ITEM 1A. Risk Factors   If significant changes occur within the pharmacy provider marketplace, or if other issues arise with respect to our pharmacy networks, including the loss of or adverse change in our relationship with one or more key pharmacy providers, our business and financial results could be impaired.  More than 68,000 retail pharmacies, which represent over 99% of all United States retail pharmacies, participated in one or more of our networks as of December 31, 2018. The ten largest retail pharmacy chains represent approximately 61% of the total number of stores in our largest network. In certain geographic areas of the United States, our networks may be comprised of higher concentrations of one or more large pharmacy chains. Contracts with retail pharmacies are generally non-exclusive and are terminable on relatively short notice by either party. If one or more of the larger pharmacy chains terminates its relationship with us, or is able to renegotiate terms substantially less favorable to us, our customers' access to retail pharmacies and/or our business could be materially adversely affected. The entry of one or more additional large pharmacy chains into the pharmacy benefit management business, the consolidation of existing pharmacy chains or increased leverage or market share by the largest pharmacy providers could increase the likelihood of negative changes in our relationship with such pharmacies. Changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks, or reduced pharmacy access under our networks, could have a negative impact on our claims volume and/or our competitiveness in the marketplace, which could cause us to fall short of certain guarantees in our contracts with clients or otherwise impair our business or results of operations.    Changes in drug pricing or industry pricing benchmarks could materially impact our financial performance.  Contracts in the prescription drug industry, including our contracts with retail pharmacy networks and our pharmacy and specialty pharmacy clients, generally use "average wholesale price" or "AWP," which is published by a third party, as a benchmark to establish pricing for prescription drugs. If AWP is no longer published by third parties, we adopt other pricing benchmarks for establishing prices within the industry or future changes in drug prices substantially deviate from our expectations, the short- or long-term impacts may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.    As a global company, we face political, legal, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks that present challenges and could negatively affect our multinational operations and/or our long-term growth.  As a global company, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks can vary substantially by market, and include political, legal, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks, including government intervention that we do not face in our U.S. operations. The global nature of our business and operations may present challenges including, but not limited to, those arising from:  • geopolitical business conditions and demands, including the June 2016 referendum in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union;   • regulation that may discriminate against U.S. companies, favor nationalization or expropriate assets;  • price controls or other pricing issues and exchange controls; restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds out of the countries in which we operate; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations and restrictions on converting currencies from foreign operations into other currencies; uncertainty with respect to the interpretation of tax positions;  • reliance on local employees and interpretations of labor laws in foreign jurisdictions;  • managing our partner relationships in countries outside of the United States;  • providing data protection on a global basis and sufficient levels of technical support in different locations;   • the global trend for companies to enact local data residency requirements;  • acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters or pandemics in locations where we operate; and  • general economic and political conditions.  These factors may increase in significance as we continue to expand globally and operating in new foreign markets may require considerable management time before operations generate any significant revenues and earnings. Any one of these challenges could negatively affect our operations or long-term growth. For example, due to the concentration of our international business in South Korea, the International Markets segment is exposed to potential losses resulting from economic and regulatory changes in that country and the geopolitical climate in the Korean Peninsula, as well as foreign currency movements affecting the South Korean currency, that could have a significant impact on the segment's results and our consolidated financial results.  International operations also require us to devote significant resources to implement controls and systems in new markets to comply with, and to ensure that our vendors and partners comply with, U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting bribery, corruption and money laundering, in addition to other regulations regarding, among other things, our products, direct-to-consumer communications, customer privacy, data protection and data residency. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant reputational harm. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges. Our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and long-term growth.    We are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and functions.  To improve operating costs, productivity and efficiencies, we contract with third parties for the provision of specific services. Our operations may be adversely affected if a third party fails to satisfy its obligations to us, if the arrangement is terminated in whole or in part or if there is a     ​    ​    ​ CIGNA CORPORATION - 2018 Form 10-K 29          Back to Contents PART I ITEM 1A. Risk Factors contractual dispute between us and the third party. Even though contracts are intended to provide certain protections, we have limited control over the actions of third parties. For example, noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations, any security breach involving one of our third-party vendors or a dispute between us and a third-party vendor related to our arrangement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.  Outsourcing also may require us to change our existing operations, adopt new processes for managing these service providers and/or redistribute responsibilities to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies. If there are delays or difficulties in changing business processes or our third-party vendors do not perform as expected, we may not realize, or not realize on a timely basis, the anticipated economic and other benefits of these relationships. This could result in substantial costs or regulatory compliance issues, divert management's attention from other strategic activities, negatively affect employee morale or create other operational or financial problems for us. Terminating or transitioning in whole or in part arrangements with key vendors could result in additional costs or penalties, risks of operational delays or potential errors and control issues during the termination or transition phase. We may not be able to find an alternative vendor in a timely manner or on acceptable terms. If there is an interruption in business or loss of access to data resulting from a security breach, termination or transition in services, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and, in turn, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.    A significant disruption in service within our operations or among our key suppliers or other third parties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as claims processing and payment, internet support and customer call centers, data centers and corporate facilities, processing new and renewal business, maintaining appropriate shipment and storage conditions for prescriptions (such as temperature and protection from contamination) and mail order processing. In some instances, our ability to provide services or products (including processing and dispensing prescriptions) depends on the availability of services and products provided by suppliers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, vendors or shipping carriers. Any failure or disruption of our performance of, or our ability to perform, key business functions, including through unavailability or cyber-attack of our information technology systems or those of third parties, could cause slower response times, decreased levels of service satisfaction and harm to our reputation. In addition, because our information technology and other systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. Our failure to implement adequate business continuity and disaster recovery strategies could significantly reduce our ability to provide products and services to our customers and clients, which could have material adverse effects on our business and results of operations.    Acquisitions, including our acquisition of Express Scripts, joint ventures and other transactions involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of integration difficulties, underperformance relative to our expectations and other challenges.  As part of our growth strategy, we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing arrangements and other relationships (collectively referred to as "strategic transactions"). Our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of these strategic transactions is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including our ability to integrate operations, resources and systems, including data security systems, in an efficient and effective manner.  The success of the Express Scripts acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of Cigna and Express Scripts and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies, from the combination. This integration is a complex, costly and time-consuming process, which may divert management's attention from ongoing business concerns.  Key risks of the Express Scripts integration include, but are not limited to, retaining existing clients and attracting new clients on profitable terms; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; integrating two unique corporate cultures; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and realizing operational synergies; integrating information technology, communications programs, financial procedures and operations, and other systems, procedures and policies; coordinating geographically separate organizations; managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company; and necessary modifications to internal financial control standards.  Integration activities may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of integration, including with respect to Express Scripts, may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected. Delays or issues encountered in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on the revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition of the combined company.  Strategic transactions could result in increased costs, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and costs to retain key employees, decreases in expected revenues, earnings or cash flows, and goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of Express Scripts' businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of those businesses, should allow us to more than offset incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. In addition, the trading price of our securities may decline if, among other things, we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings, if our operational cost savings estimates are not realized, or the transaction costs related to the acquisition and integration are greater than expected. The trading price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.  Further, we may finance strategic transactions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price that could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders, or by incurring additional debt that could impact our ability to access capital in the future.  In addition, effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to mitigate the risk of fraud. The integration of businesses, including Express Scripts, is likely to cause increasing complexity in our systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in assimilating businesses into our control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting     ​ 30 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2018 Form 10-K   ​    ​          Back to Contents PART I ITEM 1A. Risk Factors obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information that could negatively impact the trading price of our securities and our access to capital.    Our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems.  Our business is highly dependent on maintaining effective information systems as well as the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our customers and health care professionals and to operate our business. If our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable due to fraud or other error, or if we, or any of the third-party service providers we engage, were to fail to maintain information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience operational disruptions that may impact our clients, customers and health care professionals and hinder our ability to provide services and products, establish appropriate pricing for products and services, retain and attract clients and customers, establish reserves and report financial results timely and accurately and maintain regulatory compliance, among other things.  Our information technology strategy and execution are critical to our continued success. We must continue to invest in long-term solutions that will enable us to anticipate customer needs and expectations, enhance the customer experience, act as a differentiator in the market and protect against cybersecurity risks and threats. Our success is dependent, in large part, on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continuing to deliver and enhance technology systems that support our business processes in a cost-efficient and resource-efficient manner. Increasing regulatory and legislative changes will place additional demands on our information technology infrastructure that could have a direct impact on resources available for other projects tied to our strategic initiatives. In addition, recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important. We must also develop new systems to meet current market standards and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and customer needs. Failure to do so may present compliance challenges and impede our ability to deliver services in a competitive manner. Further, because system development projects are long-term in nature, they may be more costly than expected to complete and may not deliver the expected benefits upon completion. Our failure to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.    As a large health service company, we are subject to cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents. If we are unable to prevent or contain the effects of any such attacks, we may suffer exposure to substantial liability, reputational harm, loss of revenue or other damages.  Our business depends on our clients' and customers' willingness to entrust us with their health-related and other sensitive personal information. Computer systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses or malware, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. We have been, and will likely continue to be, the target of computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations. There have been, and will likely continue to be, large scale cyber-attacks within the health service industry. As we increase the amount of personal information that we store and share digitally, our exposure to data security and related cybersecurity risks increases, including the risk of undetected attacks, damage, loss or unauthorized access or misappropriation of proprietary or personal information, and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases. If disruptions or breaches are not detected quickly, their effect could be compounded. We have implemented security technologies, processes and procedures to protect consumer identity and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware and other cyber risks; however, there are no assurances that such measures will be effective against all types of breaches.  Cyber-security threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to our proprietary systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including third parties, such as external service providers, and the techniques used change frequently or are often not recognized until after they have been launched. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. In addition, while we have certain standards for all vendors that provide us services, our vendors, and in turn, their own service providers, may become subject to the same types of security breaches. Finally, our offices may be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, misplaced or lost data, human error or similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our customers' and clients' data.  The costs to eliminate or address security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers.  In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us, our customers or other third-parties could expose our customers' private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft. Unauthorized dissemination of confidential and proprietary information about our business and strategy also could negatively affect the achievement of our strategic initiatives. Such events could cause us to breach our contractual confidentiality obligations and violate applicable laws. These events would negatively affect our ability to compete, others' trust in us, our reputation, customer base and revenues and expose us to mandatory disclosure (including to the media), litigation and other enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties and/or remediation costs, and compensatory, special, punitive and statutory damages, consent orders and other adverse actions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.     ​    ​    ​ CIGNA CORPORATION - 2018 Form 10-K 31                    Table of Contents  PART I ITEM 1A. Risk Factors    In managing medical practices and operating onsite clinics and other types of medical facilities, we may be subject to additional liability that could result in significant time and expense.  In addition to contracting with physicians and other health care providers for services, we employ physicians, nurses and other health care professionals at onsite low acuity and primary care practices and infusion clinics that we manage and operate for our customers, as well as certain clinics for our employees. We also provide in-home care through health care professionals that we employ, as well as, through third-party contractors. As such, we are subject to liability for negligent acts, omissions, or injuries occurring at one of these clinics or caused by one of our employees. The defense of any actions may result in significant expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.           Legal and Compliance Risks         Our business is subject to substantial government regulation, as well as new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  Our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. The laws and rules governing our business and related interpretations are increasing in number and complexity, are subject to frequent change and can be inconsistent or in conflict with each other.  Noncompliance with applicable regulations by us or our third-party vendors could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.  We must identify, assess and respond to new trends in the legislative and regulatory environment, as well as comply with the various existing regulations applicable to our business. From time to time, certain legislative and/or regulatory proposals are made which seek to manage the health care industry, including managing prescription drug cost, regulating drug distribution and managing health records. The trading price of our securities may react to the announcement of such proposals. We are unable to predict whether any such policies or proposals will be enacted, or the specific terms thereof. Certain of these policies or proposals could, if enacted, adversely impact our business and results of operations.  Existing or future laws, rules, regulatory interpretations or judgments could force us to change how we conduct our business, affect the products and services we offer, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our costs, including operating, health care technology and administrative costs, and require enhancements to our compliance infrastructure and internal controls environment. We are required to obtain and maintain insurance and other regulatory approvals to market many of our products, increase prices for certain regulated products and consummate some of our acquisitions and dispositions. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs. Existing or future laws and rules could also require or lead us to take other actions such as changing our business practices, and could increase our liability.  Further, failure to effectively implement or adjust our strategic and operational initiatives, such as by reducing operating costs, adjusting premium pricing or benefit design or transforming our business model in response to regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, including, but not limited to, our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.  For more information on regulations to which we are subject, see "Business – Regulation" in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.    There are various risks associated with participating in government-sponsored programs, such as Medicare, including dependence upon government funding, compliance with government contracts and increased regulatory oversight.  Through our Government business, we contract with CMS and various state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services including Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare-approved prescription drug plans. If we fail to comply with CMS's contractual requirements, including data submission, enrollment and marketing, provider network adequacy, provider directory accuracy, quality measures, claims payment, continuity of care and call center performance, we may be subject to administrative actions, fines or other penalties that could impact our profitability.  Revenues from Medicare programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government through CMS and/or applicable state or local governments. Funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control including general economic conditions, continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities. These entities generally have the right to not renew or cancel their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available. Unanticipated changes in funding, such as the application of sequestration by the federal or state governments or the failure to provide for continued appropriations or regular ongoing scheduled payments to us, could substantially reduce our revenues and profitability.  The Medicare program has been the subject of regulatory reform initiatives. The premium rates paid to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans are established by contract, although the rates differ depending on a combination of factors, many of which are outside our control. The Star Rating system is subject to change annually by CMS, which may make it more difficult to achieve four stars or greater. A plan's Star Rating affects its image in the market and plans that perform well are able to market more effectively and for longer periods of time than other plans. Our Medicare Advantage plans' and Medicare Part D plans' operating results, premium revenue and benefit offerings are likely to continue to be significantly determined by their Star Ratings. A portion of each Medicare Advantage plan's reimbursement is tied to the plan's Star Rating, with those plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for quality-based bonus payments. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our Star Ratings in future years. In addition, audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our Star Ratings. Accordingly, our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses,     ​ 32 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2018 Form 10-K   ​    ​          Back to Contents PART I ITEM 1A. Risk Factors which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer, reduce membership and/or impact our financial performance. See Part II, Item 7 – Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Information – Health Care Industry Developments and Other Matters Affecting our Global Health Care Segment for additional information on our Star Ratings.  On November 1, 2018, CMS released a proposed rule that would revise its Risk Adjustment Data Validation methodology by, among other things, excluding an adjustment for underlying fee-for-service data errors and extrapolating RADV results at the contract level. If adopted in its current form, the rule could have a detrimental impact to all Medicare Advantage insurers and affect the ability of plans to deliver high quality health care for the population served. While it is uncertain that CMS will issue the rule as proposed, if adopted, it could have a material impact on the Company's future results of operations.  Our participation in health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers involves uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The executive order signed in October 2017 that halted payment of the cost sharing reduction subsidies has created additional uncertainty regarding the future of public health insurance exchanges. Risk adjustment balances are subject to audit and adjustment by CMS.  Any failure to comply with various state and federal health care laws and regulations, including those directed at preventing fraud and abuse in government funded programs, could result in investigations or litigation, such as actions under the federal False Claims Act and similar whistleblower statutes under state laws. This could subject us to damage awards, fines, penalties or other enforcement actions, restrictions on our ability to market or enroll new customers, limits on expansion, restrictions or exclusions from programs or other agreements with federal or state governmental agencies, which could adversely impact our business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.    We face risks related to litigation, regulatory audits and investigations.  We are routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory audits, investigations and other legal matters arising, for the most part, in the ordinary course of business, including that of administering and insuring employee benefit programs. These legal matters could include benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, claims arising from consumer protection laws, false claims act laws, claims disputes under federal or state laws and disputes regarding reinsurance arrangements, employment and employment discrimination-related suits, antitrust claims, employee benefit claims, wage and hour claims, tax, privacy, intellectual property and whistleblower claims, shareholder suits and other securities law claims and real estate disputes. In addition, we have incurred and likely will continue to incur liability for practices and claims related to our health care business, such as marketing misconduct, failure to timely or appropriately pay for or provide health care, provider network structure, poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged, provider disputes including disputes over compensation or contractual provisions, ERISA claims, allegations related to calculations of cost sharing and claims related to our administration of self-funded business. There are currently, and may be in the future, attempts to bring class action lawsuits against the company and other companies in our industry; individual plaintiffs also may bring multiple claims regarding the same subject matter against us and other companies in our industry.  Court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. In some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive damages may be sought. We seek to procure insurance coverage to cover some of these potential liabilities. However, certain potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may be insufficient to cover the entire damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. It is possible that the resolution of current or future legal matters and claims could result in changes to our industry and business practices, losses material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity or damage to our reputation.  We are frequently the subject of regulatory market conduct and other reviews, audits and investigations by state insurance and health and welfare and pharmacy departments, attorneys general, CMS and the OIG and comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. With respect to our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D businesses, CMS and OIG perform audits to determine a health plan's compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations, including compliance with proper coding practices and fraud and abuse enforcement practices through audits designed to detect and correct improper payments. The Department of Justice is conducting an industry review of the risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes, including review of medical charts, of Cigna and a number of other Medicare Advantage organizations under Medicare Parts C and D. There also continues to be heightened review by federal and state regulators of business and reporting practices within the health service, disability and life insurance industries, including with respect to claims payment and related escheat practices, and increased scrutiny by other state and federal governmental agencies (such as state attorneys general) empowered to bring criminal actions in circumstances that could have previously given rise only to civil or administrative proceedings.  In addition, various governmental agencies have conducted investigations and audits into certain pharmacy benefit management practices. Many of these investigations and audits have resulted in other companies agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and corporate integrity agreements. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such governmental investigations and audits may ultimately have on us or on the industry in general. However, we may experience government scrutiny and audit activity which may result in the payment or offset of prior reimbursements from the government.  Regulatory audits or reviews or actions by other governmental agencies could result in changes to our business practices, retroactive adjustments to certain premiums, significant fines, penalties, civil liabilities, criminal liabilities or other sanctions, including restrictions on our ability to market certain products or engage in business-related activities, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, disclosure of an adverse investigation or audit or the imposition of fines or other sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in certain markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services.  A description of material pending legal actions and other legal and regulatory matters is included in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. The outcome of litigation and other legal or regulatory matters is always uncertain.     ​    ​    ​ CIGNA CORPORATION - 2018 Form 10-K 33          Back to Contents PART I ITEM 1A. Risk Factors   If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, our business and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.  Most of our activities involve the receipt, use, storage or transmission of a substantial amount of individuals' protected health information and personally identifiable information. We also use aggregated and anonymized data for research and analysis purposes, and in some cases, provide access to such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and third-party data aggregators and analysts. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with clients. In some cases, such laws, rules, regulations and contractual requirements also apply to our vendors and require us to obtain written assurances of their compliance with such requirements or may hold us liable for any violations by our vendors. We are also subject to various other consumer protection laws that regulate our communications with customers. Certain of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities. International laws, rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information, such as the GDPR, are generally more stringent than in the United States, and they vary across jurisdictions.  These laws, rules, and contractual requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy, security and data laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. For example, the HITECH amendments to HIPAA may further restrict our ability to collect, disclose and use sensitive personal information and may impose additional compliance requirements on our business.  HIPAA requires covered entities to comply with the HIPAA privacy, security and breach rules. In addition, business associates must comply with the HIPAA security and breach requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS has continued its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and has expanded it to include business associates. In addition, HHS has increased its enforcement efforts. These efforts can result in enforcement actions that are the result of investigations brought on by the notification to HHS of a breach. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance or the implementation of an enforcement action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation.    Effective prevention, detection and control systems are critical to maintain regulatory compliance and prevent fraud and failure of these systems could adversely affect us.  Federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud and abuse a priority. Fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of customers, billing for unnecessary medical services, improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us are complex and subject to change. In addition, ongoing vigorous law enforcement, a highly technical regulatory scheme and the Dodd-Frank Act legislation and related regulations enhance regulators' enforcement powers and whistleblower incentives and protections. Our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources. Failure of our prevention, detection or control systems related to regulatory compliance or the failure of employees to comply with our internal policies including data systems security or unethical conduct by managers and employees, could adversely affect our reputation and also expose us to litigation and other proceedings, fines and penalties.  In addition, provider or customer fraud that is not prevented or detected could impact our medical costs or those of our self-insured clients. Further, during an economic downturn, we may experience increased fraudulent claims volume that may lead to additional costs due to an increase in disputed claims and litigation.           Economic Risks         Significant stock market or interest rate declines could result in additional unfunded pension obligations resulting in the need for additional plan funding by us and increased pension expenses.  We currently have unfunded obligations in our frozen pension plans. A significant decline in the value of the plans' equity and fixed income investments or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially increase our expenses and change the timing and amount of required plan funding. This could reduce the cash available to us, including our subsidiaries. We are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk associated with our pension and other post-retirement obligations. Sustained declines in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the funded status of our pension plans and our reinvestment yield on new investments. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our obligations under the pension plans.    Significant changes in market interest rates affect the value of our financial instruments that promise a fixed return or benefit and the value of particular assets and liabilities.  As an insurer, we have substantial investment assets that support insurance and contractholder deposit liabilities. Generally low levels of interest rates on investments, such as those experienced in U.S. and foreign financial markets during recent years, have negatively impacted our level of investment income earned in recent periods.  A substantial portion of our investment assets are in fixed interest-yielding debt securities of varying maturities, fixed redeemable preferred securities and commercial mortgage loans. The value of these investment assets can fluctuate significantly with changes in market conditions. A rise in interest rates would likely reduce the value of our investment portfolio and increase interest expense if we were to access our available lines of credit.     ​ 34 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2018 Form 10-K   ​    ​          Back to Contents PART I ITEM 1A. Risk Factors   A downgrade in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect new sales and retention of current business, and a downgrade in our debt ratings would increase the cost of borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to access capital.  Financial strength, claims paying ability and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are each important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance and health benefits companies. Ratings information by nationally recognized ratings agencies is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe that the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our products to certain customers. Our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Each of the rating agencies reviews ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. A downgrade of any of these ratings in the future could make it more difficult to either market our products successfully or raise capital to support business growth within our insurance subsidiaries.    Global market, economic and geopolitical conditions may cause fluctuations in equity market prices, interest rates and credit spreads that could impact our ability to raise or deploy capital and affect our overall liquidity.  If the equity and credit markets experience extreme volatility and disruption, there could be downward pressure on stock prices and restricted access to capital for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. Extreme disruption in the credit markets could adversely impact our access to, and cost of, capital in the future.  In the event of adverse economic and industry conditions, we may be required to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds we have available for other purposes, such as investments and other expenditures in ongoing businesses, acquisitions, dividends and stock repurchases. In these circumstances, our ability to execute our strategy may be limited, our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in business and market conditions may be reduced, or our access to capital markets may be limited such that additional capital may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.    In connection with the combination with Express Scripts, we have considerably higher levels of indebtedness than Cigna and Express Scripts previously carried, which will result in higher relative debt service costs and less cash flow from operations available to fund growth, stock repurchases and other corporate purposes during our deleveraging process.  The long-term indebtedness of Cigna was approximately $39.5 billion as of December 31, 2018. This level of indebtedness:  • requires us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to debt payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies, make stock repurchases, pay dividends and for general corporate purposes;   • increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including increases in interest rates for our borrowings that bear interest at variable rates and are in a greater amount than floating rate assets held, or if such indebtedness is refinanced at a time when interest rates are higher; and   • limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry.  The covenants to which we have agreed in connection with the financing, and our indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio in comparison to that of Cigna or Express Scripts on a recent historical basis, may have the effect, among other things, of restricting our financial and operating flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, creating competitive disadvantages compared to other competitors with lower debt levels during the deleveraging process.    Unfavorable developments in economic conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Many factors, including geopolitical issues, future economic downturns, availability and cost of credit and other capital and consumer spending can negatively impact the U.S. and global economies. Our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on our customers (both employers and individuals), health care providers, pharmacy manufacturers, pharmacy providers and third-party vendors. For example:  • Employers may take action to reduce their operating costs by modifying, delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products or making changes in the mix of products purchased that are unfavorable to us.  • Higher unemployment rates and workforce reductions could result in lower enrollment in our employer-based plans (including an increase in the number of employees who opt out of employer-based plans) or our individual plans.  • Because of unfavorable economic conditions or the ACA, employers may stop offering health care coverage to employees or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs.  • Our historical disability claim experience and industry data indicate that submitted disability claims rise under adverse economic conditions.   • If clients are not successful in generating sufficient funds or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us.  • Our clients or potential clients may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business.     ​    ​    ​ CIGNA CORPORATION - 2018 Form 10-K 35          Back to Contents PART I ITEM 1A. Risk Factors  • Our clients may be acquired, consolidated, or otherwise fail to successfully maintain or grow their business or workforce which could reduce the number of customers we serve or otherwise result in lower than anticipated utilization of our services.  • A prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other health care providers, potentially increasing our medical costs as these providers attempt to maintain revenue levels in their efforts to adjust to their own economic challenges.  • Our third-party vendors could significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output to reduce their operating costs. Our business depends on our ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion.  These factors could lead to a decrease in our customer base, revenues or margins and/or an increase in our operating costs.  In addition, during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced or delayed reimbursements or payments in state and federal government programs such as Medicare and Social Security or under contracts with government entities. These state and federal budgetary pressures also could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments on us, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and HMOs and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through, among other things, increases in premiums, there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.    We are subject to the credit risk of our reinsurers.  We enter into reinsurance arrangements with other insurance companies, primarily to limit losses from large exposures or to permit recovery of a portion of direct losses. We also may enter into reinsurance arrangements in connection with acquisition or divestiture transactions when the underwriting company is not being acquired or sold.  Under all reinsurance arrangements, reinsurers assume insured losses, subject to certain limitations or exceptions that may include a loss limit. These arrangements also subject us to various obligations, representations and warranties with the reinsurers. Reinsurance does not relieve us of liability as the originating insurer. We remain liable to the underlying policyholders if a reinsurer defaults on obligations under the reinsurance arrangement. Although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, reinsurers may become financially unsound. If a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance contract or if the liabilities exceed any applicable loss limit, we will be forced to cover the claims on the reinsured policies.  The collectability of amounts due from reinsurers is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including whether the insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract, whether reinsurers or their affiliates have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of the reinsurance contract and the magnitude and type of collateral supporting our reinsurance recoverable, such as holding sufficient qualifying assets in trusts or letters of credit issued. Although a portion of our reinsurance exposures are secured, the inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.     ​ 36 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2018 Form 10-K   ​    ​                    Table of Contents  PART I ITEM 1B.
