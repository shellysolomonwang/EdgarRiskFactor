Item 1A.  Risk Factors    The Company’s future operating results and cash flows may differ materially from the results described in this 10-K due to risks and uncertainties related to the Company’s business, including those discussed below. In addition, these factors represent risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by forward-looking statements contained in this report.   Key Company products generate a significant amount of the Company’s profits and cash flows, and any events that adversely affect the market for its leading products could have a material and negative impact on results of operations and cash flows.   The Company’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow is dependent upon the increasing profitability of the Company’s cholesterol franchise, consisting of VYTORIN and ZETIA. In addition, products such as CLARINEX, PEG-INTRON, REBETOL, REMICADE, TEMODAR, OTC CLARITIN and NASONEX accounted for a material portion of 2005 revenues. As a result of the Company’s dependence on key products, any events that adversely affect the markets for these products could have a significant impact on results of operations. These events include loss of patent protection, increased costs associated with manufacturing, OTC availability of the Company’s product or a competitive product, the discovery of previously unknown side effects, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective treatments, and discontinuation or removal from the market of the product for any reason.  10   Table of Contents  More specifically, the profitability of the Company’s cholesterol franchise may be adversely affected by the introduction of generic forms of two competing cholesterol products that will lose patent protection in 2006. In addition, generic Flonase (fluticasone propionate) was approved in 2006 and may unfavorably impact the corticosteroid nasal spray market.   Past examples of events in recent years that have adversely affected the market for leading products include events that have affected the market for CLARINEX and PEG-INTRON and REBETOL, particularly in the U.S. CLARINEX continues to experience intense competition in the prescription U.S. allergy market after the launch of CLARITIN OTC and a competing OTC loratadine product in the U.S. in December 2002 and the introduction of generic Allegra (fexofenadine) in the U.S. in September 2005. In addition, as a result of the introduction of a competitor’s product for pegylated interferon and the introduction of generic ribavirin, the value of PEG-INTRON (pegylated interferon) and REBETOL (ribavirin) combination therapy for hepatitis has been severely diminished and earnings and cash flow have been materially and negatively impacted.   There is a high risk that funds invested in research will not generate financial returns because the development of novel drugs requires significant expenditures with a low probability of success.   There is a high rate of failure inherent in the research to develop new drugs to treat diseases. As a result, there is a high risk that funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. This risk profile is compounded by the fact that this research has a long investment cycle. To bring a pharmaceutical compound from the discovery phase to market may take a decade or more and failure can occur at any point in the process, including later in the process after significant funds have been invested.   The Company’s success is dependent on the development and marketing of new products, and uncertainties in the regulatory and approval process may result in the failure of products to reach the market.   Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach market for numerous reasons, including the following:            •   findings of ineffectiveness or harmful side effects in clinical or pre-clinical testing;         •   failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals, including delays in the approval of new products and new indications;         •   lack of economic feasibility due to manufacturing costs or other factors; and         •   preclusion from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others.    Intellectual property protection is an important contributor to the Company’s profitability and as patents covering the Company’s products expire or if they are found to be invalid, generic forms of the Company’s products may be introduced to the market, which may have a material and negative affect on results of operations.   Intellectual property protection is critical to Schering-Plough’s ability to successfully commercialize its products. Upon the expiration or the successful challenge of the Company’s patents covering a product, competitors may introduce generic versions of such products, which may include the Company’s well-  11   Table of Contents  established products. Such generic competition could result in the loss of a significant portion of sales or downward pressures on the prices at which the Company offers formerly patented products, particularly in the U.S. Patents and patent applications relating to Schering-Plough’s significant products are of material importance to Schering-Plough.   Additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and negatively affect the Company’s results of operations.   Patent disputes can be costly to prosecute and defend and adverse judgments could result in damage awards, increased royalties and other similar payments and decreased sales.   Patent positions can be highly uncertain and patent disputes in the pharmaceutical industry are not unusual. An adverse result in a patent dispute involving the Company’s patents may lead to a loss of market exclusivity and render the Company’s patents invalid. An adverse result in a patent dispute involving patents held by a third party may preclude the commercialization of the Company’s products, force the Company to obtain licenses in order to continue manufacturing or marketing the affected products, negatively affect sales of existing products or result in injunctive relief and payment of financial remedies. For example, the Company’s product, DR. SCHOLL’S FREEZE AWAY wart removal product, is currently the subject of a patent infringement action brought by a third party company, and an adverse outcome in this action may result in the Company’s inability to continue manufacturing the product.   Even if the Company is ultimately successful in a particular dispute, the Company may incur substantial costs in defending its patents and other intellectual property rights. For example, a generic manufacturer may file an Abbreviated New Drug Application seeking approval after the expiration of the applicable data exclusivity and alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s New Drug Application are invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a Paragraph IV certification. The innovator then has the ability to file suit against the generic manufacturer to enforce its patents. In recent years, generic manufacturers have used Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals, and it is anticipated that this trend will continue. The potential for litigation regarding Schering-Plough’s intellectual property rights always exists and may be initiated by third parties attempting to abridge Schering-Plough’s rights, as well as by Schering-Plough in protecting its rights.   U.S. and foreign regulations, including those establishing the Company’s ability to price products, may negatively affect the Company’s sales and profit margins.   The Company faces increased pricing pressure in the U.S. and abroad from managed care organizations, institutions and government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company’s sales and profit margins. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 contains a prescription drug benefit for individuals who are eligible for Medicare. The prescription drug benefit became effective on January 1, 2006, and it is anticipated that it may result in increased purchasing power of those negotiating on behalf of Medicare recipients.   In addition to legislation concerning price controls, other trends that could affect the Company’s business include legislative or regulatory action relating to pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement, health care reform initiatives and drug importation legislation, involuntary approval of medicines for OTC use, consolidation among customers, and trends toward managed care and health care costs containment.   As a result of the U.S. government’s efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses, managed care organizations continue to grow in influence and the Company faces increased pricing pressure as managed care organizations continue to seek price discounts with respect to the Company’s products.   In the international markets, cost control methods including restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasis on greater use of generic drugs, and across the board price cuts may decrease revenues internationally.  12   Table of Contents  There are material pending investigations against the Company, the outcome of which could include the commencement of civil and/or criminal proceedings involving the imposition of substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs.   The Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome of the pending investigations to which it is subject, any of which may lead to a judgment or settlement involving a significant monetary award or restrictions on its operations.   The pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of the Company and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. These entities include the Department of Justice and its U.S. Attorney’s Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission and various state Attorneys General offices. Many of the health care laws under which certain of these governmental entities operate, including the federal and state anti-kickback statutes and statutory and common law false claims laws, have been construed broadly by the courts and permit the government entities to exercise significant discretion. In the event that any of those governmental entities believes that wrongdoing has occurred, one or more of them could institute civil or criminal proceedings, which, if instituted and resolved unfavorably, could subject the Company to substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs. The Company also cannot predict whether any investigations will affect its marketing practices or sales. Any such result could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or its business.   Regardless of the merits or outcomes of these investigations, government investigations are costly, divert management’s attention from the Company’s business and may result in substantial damage to the Company’s reputation. Please refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this report for descriptions of these pending investigations.   There are other legal matters in which adverse outcomes could negatively affect the Company’s business.   Unfavorable outcomes in other pending litigation matters, including litigation concerning product pricing, securities law violations, product liability claims, ERISA matters, patent and intellectual property disputes, and antitrust matters could preclude the commercialization of products, negatively affect the profitability of existing products, materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, or subject the Company to conditions that affect business operations, such as exclusion from government reimbursement programs.   Please refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this report for descriptions of significant pending litigation.   The Company is subject to governmental regulations, and the failure to comply with, as well as the costs of compliance of, these regulations may adversely affect the Company’s financial position and results of operations.   The Company’s manufacturing facilities must meet stringent regulatory standards and are subject to regular inspections. The cost of regulatory compliance, including that associated with compliance failures, can materially affect the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Failure to comply with regulations, which include pharmacovigilance reporting requirements and standards relating to clinical, laboratory and manufacturing practices, can result in delays in the approval of drugs, seizure or recalls of drugs, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of drugs, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions.   For example, in May 2002, the Company agreed with the FDA to the entry of a Consent Decree to resolve issues related to compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices at certain of the Company’s facilities in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. The Consent Decree work placed significant additional controls on production and release of products from these sites, which increased costs and  13   Table of Contents  slowed production and led to a reduction in the number of products produced at the sites. Further, the Company’s research and development operations were negatively impacted by the Consent Decree because these operations share common facilities with the manufacturing operations.   The Company also is subject to other regulations, including environmental, health and safety and labor regulations.   Developments following regulatory approval may decrease demand for the Company’s products.   Even after a product reaches market, certain developments following regulatory approval may decrease demand for the Company’s products, including the following:            •   the re-review of products that are already marketed;         •   uncertainties concerning safety labeling changes; and         •   greater scrutiny in advertising and promotion.    Recently, clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. These situations also have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general, which have negatively affected the sales of such products.   In addition, following the wake of recent product withdrawals of other companies and other significant safety issues, health authorities such as the FDA, the European Medicines Agency and the Pharmaceuticals and Medicines Device Agency have increased their focus on safety, when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. Some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products or indications and are re-reviewing select products which are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties in the regulatory processes. There is also greater regulatory scrutiny, especially in the United States, on advertising and promotion and in particular direct-to-consumer advertising.   If previously unknown side effects are discovered or if there is an increase in the prevalence of negative publicity regarding known side effects of any of the Company’s products, it could significantly reduce demand for the product or may require the Company to remove the product from the market.   New products and technological advances developed by the Company’s competitors may negatively affect sales.   The Company operates in a highly competitive industry. Many of the Company’s competitors have been conducting research and development in areas both served by the Company’s current products and by those products the Company is in the process of developing. Competitive developments that may impact the Company include technological advances by, patents granted to, and new products developed by competitors or new and existing generic, prescription and/or OTC products that compete with products of Schering-Plough or the Merck/ Schering-Plough Cholesterol Partnership. In addition, it is possible that doctors, patients and providers may favor those products offered by competitors due to safety, efficacy, pricing or reimbursement characteristics, and as a result the Company will be unable to maintain its sales for such products.   Because the Company often competes with other companies to acquire or license products (whether in early stage development or already approved for commercial sale) that the Company believes to be clinically or commercially attractive, it may be difficult for the Company to enter into such transactions.   One aspect of the Company’s business is to acquire or license rights to develop or sell products from other companies. It may be challenging to acquire or license products that the Company believes to be clinically or commercially attractive on acceptable terms or at all because the Company competes for these opportunities against companies that often have far greater financial resources than the Company. The Company’s prospects may be adversely affected if it is unable to obtain rights to additional products on acceptable terms.  14   Table of Contents  The Company relies on third party relationships for its key products and changes to the third parties that are outside its control may impact the business.   The Company relies on third party relationships for many of its key products. Any time that third parties are involved, there may be changes to or influences or impact on the third parties that are outside the control of the Company that may also, directly or indirectly, impact the Company’s business operation.   The Company does not have operational or financial control over these third parties and may only have limited influence, if any, with respect to the manner in which they conduct their businesses or behave in their relationships with the Company. Also, in many cases, these third parties may offer or develop products that may compete with the Company’s products or have other conflicting interests relative to the Company.   The Company operates a global business that exposes the Company to additional risks, and any adverse events could have a material negative impact on results of operations.   The Company operates in over 120 countries, and non-U.S. operations generate the majority of the Company’s profit and cash flow. Non-U.S. operations are subject to certain risks, which are inherent in conducting business overseas. These risks include possible nationalization, expropriation, importation limitations, pricing and reimbursement restrictions, and other restrictive governmental actions or economic destabilization. Also, fluctuations in inflation, interest rate, and foreign currency exchange rates can impact Schering-Plough’s consolidated financial results.   In addition, there may be changes to the Company’s business and political position if there is instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest; and natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease.   Insurance coverage for product liability may become unavailable or cost prohibitive.   The Company maintains insurance coverage with such deductibles and self-insurance to reflect market conditions (including cost and availability) existing at the time it is written, and the relationship of insurance coverage to self-insurance varies accordingly. However, as a result of increased product liability claims in the pharmaceutical industry, the availability of third party insurance may become unavailable or cost prohibitive.   The Company is subject to evolving and complex tax laws, which may result in additional liabilities that may affect results of operations.   The Company is subject to evolving and complex tax laws in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required for determining the Company’s tax liabilities, and the Company’s tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for the 1997-2002 period are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company may be challenged by the IRS and other tax authorities on positions it has taken in its income tax returns. Although the Company believes that its accrual for tax contingencies is adequate for all open years, based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution may result in payments that materially affect shareholders’ equity, liquidity and/or cash flow.   In addition, the Company may be impacted by changes in tax laws including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations in domestic and foreign jurisdictions.  15   Table of Contents            Item 1B.
