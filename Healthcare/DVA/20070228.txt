Item 1A. Risk Factors.    This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including the risks discussed below. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in Item 7 under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation”.    If the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Approximately 35% of our dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was generated from patients who have commercial payors as the primary payor. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that pay us on terms and at rates materially higher than Medicare rates. We expect that some of our commercial reimbursement rates will be materially lower in the future as a result of general conditions in the market, recent and future consolidations among commercial payors, downward trends in health insurance premiums, increased focus on dialysis services, our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, including the reconciliation of existing contracts with differing rates, and other factors. We are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors. In the event that our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, the cumulative effect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Consolidations have significantly increased the negotiating leverage of commercial payors. In addition, we believe that payors and employers continue to encourage members to obtain care with in-network providers and network rates are typically lower than out-of-network rates. If the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    If the number of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced.    Our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our patients with higher-paying commercial insurance coverage. A patient’s insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the patient’s or a family member’s employment status. For a patient covered by an employer group health plan, Medicare generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, or earlier if the patient’s employer group health plan coverage terminates. When Medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rate we receive for that patient shifts from the employer group health plan rate to the Medicare payment rate. If there is a significant reduction in the number of patients under higher-paying commercial plans relative to government-based programs that pay at lower rates, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Future declines, or the lack of further increases, in Medicare payment rates would reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Approximately one-half of our dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was generated from patients who have Medicare as their primary payor. The Medicare End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) program pays us for dialysis treatment services at fixed rates. Unlike most other services covered by Medicare, the Medicare ESRD program has not provided for regular inflation increases in payment rates. Increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, have occurred and are expected to continue to occur regardless of whether there is a compensating increase in payment rates. We cannot predict with certainty the nature or extent of future rate changes, if any. To the extent these rates decline or are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation, our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be adversely affected.    19    Table of Contents Changes in the structure of, and payment rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    The Medicare composite rate is the payment rate for a dialysis treatment including the supplies used in those treatments, specified laboratory tests and certain pharmaceuticals. Other services and pharmaceuticals, including EPO (a pharmaceutical used to treat anemia, a common complication associated with ESRD), vitamin D analogs and iron supplements, are separately billed. Changes to the structure of the composite rate and separately billable payment rates went into effect January 1, 2006, as Medicare moved to payment rates for pharmaceuticals from average acquisition cost to average sale price plus 6%. Future changes in the structure of, and payment rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Pharmaceuticals are approximately 30% of our total Medicare revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. ESRD pharmaceutical payment rates and utilization continue to receive attention from the government, which may lead to reimbursement changes in the future. If Medicare begins to bundle other services for payment by including in its composite payment rate the pharmaceuticals, laboratory services or other ancillary services that it currently pays separately, or if there are further changes to or decreases in the payment rate for these items without a corresponding increase in the composite rate, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Changes in state Medicaid programs or payment rates could reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Approximately 5% of our dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was generated from patients who have Medicaid as their primary coverage. As state governments face increasing budgetary pressure, they may propose reductions in payment rates, limitations on eligibility or other changes to Medicaid programs. Currently, Medicaid eligibility requirements mandate that citizen enrollees in Medicaid programs provide documented proof of citizenship. Our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that we are not paid by Medicaid or other state programs for services provided to patients that are unable to satisfy the revised eligibility requirements, including undocumented patients living in the U.S. If state governments reduce the rates paid by those programs for dialysis and related services, further limit eligibility for Medicaid coverage or adopt changes similar to those adopted by Medicare, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected.    Delays in state Medicare and Medicaid certification of our dialysis centers could adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Before we can begin billing for patients that may be enrolled in government-based programs and are treated in our outpatient dialysis centers, we are required to obtain state and federal certification for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. As state governments face increasing budgetary pressure, certain states may have difficulty certifying dialysis centers in the normal course and significant delays may result. If state governments are unable to certify new centers in the normal course and we experience significant delays in our ability to treat and bill for services provided to patients covered under government programs, our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected.    Changes in clinical practices and payment rates or rules for EPO and other pharmaceuticals could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    The administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals accounts for approximately 30% of our total dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. In late 2006, there was significant media discussion regarding anemia management practices in the United States, additionally a hearing was held by the House Ways and Means Committee on the issue of EPO utilization in December 2006. Further, the FDA has been examining the labeling of Epogen and Aranesp in response to the increased scrutiny. This increased scrutiny could have an     20    Table of Contents  impact on physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices. Changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices, changes in labeling of pharmaceuticals in a manner that alters physician practice patterns or accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental payment criteria, including the introduction of EPO administration policies by private payors, the introduction of new pharmaceuticals or the conversion to alternate types of administration of EPO or other pharmaceuticals could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Changes in EPO pricing and the use and marketing of alternatives to EPO could materially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients.    Amgen Inc. is the sole supplier of EPO and may unilaterally decide to increase its price for EPO, subject to certain contractual limitations. Future changes in the cost of EPO could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows and ultimately reduces our income. Although our agreement with Amgen for EPO continues for a fixed time period and includes potential pricing discounts depending upon the achievement of certain clinical and other criteria, we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the discount structure for EPO that we currently receive, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved. In addition, our contract with Amgen provides for specific rebates and incentives that are based on patient outcomes, process improvement, data submission, purchase volume growth and some combination of these factors. Factors that could impact our ability to qualify for the discounts, rebates and incentives provided for in our agreement with Amgen include our ability to achieve certain clinical outcomes, changes in pharmaceutical intensities and our growth. We have and may from time to time accelerate our EPO purchase volume in a given period to take advantage of certain incentives provided for in the agreement, which could result in an increase in our inventory levels. Failure to qualify for discounts or meet or exceed the targets and earn the specified rebates and incentives could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.    Amgen has developed and obtained FDA approval for Aranesp®, a pharmaceutical used to treat anemia that may replace EPO or reduce its use with dialysis patients. In addition, Roche has developed and is seeking approval for CERA, a pharmaceutical also used to treat anemia. Unlike EPO, which is generally administered in conjunction with each dialysis treatment, these pharmaceuticals are administered less frequently. In the event that these similar alternatives to EPO are marketed for the treatment of dialysis patients, we may realize lower margins on the administration of such pharmaceuticals than are currently realized with EPO. In addition, to the extent that changes in administration practices occur as a result of changes in labeling of these pharmaceuticals in a manner that alters physician practice patterns or accepted clinical practices or such pharmaceuticals begin to be administered to patients through channels other than DaVita, we would realize a significant reduction in revenue or profit from such administration. A significant increase in the development and use of similar alternatives to EPO, or a change in administration practices, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    The investigation related to the subpoena we received on March 4, 2005 from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri could result in substantial penalties against us.    We are voluntarily cooperating with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri with respect to the subpoena we received on March 4, 2005, which requested a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including documents related to, among other things, pharmaceutical and other services provided to patients, relationships with pharmaceutical companies, financial relationships with physicians and joint ventures and the related request for additional documents related to specific medical director and joint venture arrangements we received in October 2005, and the additional subpoena we received in February 2006 requesting documents related to certain patient records relating to the administration and billing of EPO. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may     21    Table of Contents  be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as this to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoenas will continue to require management’s attention and significant legal expense.    The investigation related to the subpoena we received on October 25, 2004 from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York could result in substantial penalties against us.    We are voluntarily cooperating with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the OIG with respect to the subpoena we received on October 25, 2004, which requires production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including DaVita Laboratory Services. DVA Renal Healthcare received a similar subpoena in November 2004. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us and DVA Renal Healthcare in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and DVA Renal Healthcare, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us or DVA Renal Healthcare at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as this to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoenas may require management’s attention and significant legal expense.    If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations, federal and state anti-kickback laws, the Stark II physician self-referral prohibition and analogous state referral statutes, and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information. The Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules related to claims submission, cost reporting, and payment processes impose complex and extensive requirements upon dialysis providers, and a violation or departure from such requirements may result in government audits, reimbursement recoupment, and the potential loss of certification.    The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers, has increased significantly in recent years. Medicare has increased the frequency and intensity of its certification inspections of dialysis centers. For example, we are required to provide substantial documentation related to the administration of pharmaceuticals, including EPO, and, to the extent that any such documentation is found insufficient, we may be required to refund any amounts received from such administration by government or private payors, and be subject to substantial penalties under applicable laws or regulations. In addition, fiscal intermediaries have increased their prepayment and post-payment reviews.    We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid payments and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with state and federal anti-kickback laws and the Stark II physician self-referral law. However, the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations. For example, none of our medical director agreements establishes compensation using the Stark II safe harbor method; rather, compensation under our medical director agreements is the result of individual negotiation and, we believe, exceeds amounts determined under the safe harbor method. If an enforcement agency were to challenge the level of compensation that we pay our medical directors, we could be required to change our practices, face criminal or civil penalties, pay substantial fines or otherwise experience a material adverse effect as a result of a challenge to these arrangements.    Because of regulatory considerations unique to each of these states, all of our dialysis operations in New York and some of our dialysis operations in New Jersey are conducted by privately-owned companies to which we provide a broad range of administrative services. These operations accounted for approximately 6% of our 2006 dialysis revenue. We believe that we have structured these operations to comply with the laws and regulations of these states, but we can give no assurances that they will not be challenged. If any of our     22    Table of Contents  operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows including:        •    Suspension or termination of our participation in government payment programs;      •    Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable payment program requirements;      •    Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government payment programs;      •    Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate, including the loss of revenues from operations in New York and New Jersey conducted by privately-owned companies as described above;      •    Reductions in payment rates or coverage for dialysis and ancillary services and related pharmaceuticals;      •    Fines, damages or monetary penalties for anti-kickback law violations, Stark II violations, submission of false claims, civil or criminal liability based on violations of law, or other failures to meet regulatory requirements;      •    Claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws;      •    Mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses; and      •    Termination of relationships with medical directors.    If our joint ventures were found to violate the law, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    As of December 31, 2006 we owned a controlling interest in approximately 85 dialysis related joint ventures, representing approximately 15% of our dialysis revenue. We anticipate that we will continue to increase the number of our joint ventures during 2007. Many of our joint ventures with physicians or physician groups also have the physician owners providing medical director services to those centers or other centers we own and operate. Because our relationships with physicians are governed by the “anti-kickback” statute contained in the Social Security Act, we have sought to structure our joint venture arrangements to satisfy as many safe harbor requirements as we believe are reasonably possible. However, our joint venture arrangements do not satisfy all elements of any safe harbor under the federal anti-kickback statute. Based on the exceptions applicable to ESRD services, we believe that our joint venture arrangements and operations materially comply with the Stark II law. The subpoena we received from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri on March 4, 2005, and the related request for additional documents received in October 2005, includes a request for documents related to our joint ventures.    If our joint ventures are found to be in violation of the anti-kickback statute or the Stark provisions, we could be required to restructure the joint ventures or refuse to accept referrals for designated health services from the physicians with whom the joint venture centers have a financial relationship. We also could be required to repay amounts received from Medicare and certain other payors by the joint ventures pursuant to prohibited referrals, and we could be subject to monetary penalties and exclusion from government healthcare programs. If our joint venture centers are subject to any of these penalties, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of dialysis revenue that we recognize and if we are unable to accurately estimate our revenue, it could impact the timing of our revenue recognition or have a significant impact on our operating results.    There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of dialysis revenue that we recognize for a reporting period. Ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 103,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes and errors in determining the correct coordination of benefits may result in refunds to payors. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are also subject to estimating risk related to the amounts not paid by the     23    Table of Contents  primary government payor that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage, the patient’s commercial health plan secondary coverage or the patient. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. If our estimates of dialysis revenue are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing of our revenue recognition and have a significant impact on our operating results.    We may be subject to liability claims for damages and other expenses not covered by insurance that could reduce our earnings and cash flows.    The administration of dialysis and related services to patients may subject us to litigation and liability for damages. Our business, profitability and growth prospects could suffer if we face negative publicity or we pay damages or defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of any applicable insurance coverage, including claims related to contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims. In addition, we have received several notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties related to our historical billing practices and the historical billing practices of DVA Renal Healthcare and other matters related to their settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted, an adverse result with respect to one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We currently maintain programs of general and professional liability insurance. However, a successful claim, including a professional liability, malpractice or negligence claim which is in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.    In addition, if our costs of insurance and claims increase, then our earnings could decline. Market rates for insurance premiums and deductibles have been steadily increasing. Our earnings and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following:        •    further increases in premiums and deductibles;      •    increases in the number of liability claims against us or the cost of settling or trying cases related to those claims; and      •    an inability to obtain one or more types of insurance on acceptable terms.    If businesses we acquire have liabilities that we are not aware of, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Our business strategy includes the acquisition of dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers, as well as other ancillary businesses. Businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities or liabilities that are in excess of the amounts that we estimated. Although we generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire for matters that are not properly disclosed to us, we are not always successful. In addition, even in cases where we are able to obtain indemnification, we may discover liabilities greater than the contractual limits or the financial resources of the indemnifying party. In the event that we are responsible for liabilities substantially in excess of any amounts recovered through rights to indemnification, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    If the ancillary services we provide or the strategic initiatives we invest in are ultimately unsuccessful, we may have to write off our investment in one or more of these activities.    Our ancillary services and strategic initiatives include pharmacy services, vascular access services, disease management services, ESRD clinical research programs and administrative services provided to minority-owned and third-party owned centers and clinics, each of which is related to our core business of providing dialysis services. If any of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives do not perform at the level that we anticipate, we may be required to write off our investment in one or more of these activities. As an example, our fixed investment in pharmacy services of approximately $13 million at the end of 2006, may be subject to future write-offs.    24    Table of Contents If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced.    Many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical director of the center. As a result, the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. Neither our current nor former medical directors have an obligation to refer their patients to our centers. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, and a new medical director is appointed, it may negatively impact the former medical director’s decision to treat his or her patients at our center. If we are unable to enforce noncompetition provisions contained in the terminated medical director agreements, former medical directors may choose to provide medical director services for competing providers or establish their own dialysis centers in competition with ours. Also, if the quality of service levels at our centers deteriorates, it may negatively impact patient referrals and treatment volumes.    Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally three to ten years. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. We may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships to assure compliance with the safe harbor provisions of the anti-kickback statute, Stark II law and other similar laws. These actions could negatively impact the decision of physicians to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us. If the terms of any existing agreement are found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship which could lead to the early termination of the agreement, or cause the physician to stop referring patients to our centers. If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced.    The level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business.    We have substantial debt outstanding, including debt we incurred to finance the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The high level of our indebtedness, among other things, could:        •    make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt securities;        •    increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;        •    require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;        •    expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent we have variable rate debt;        •    limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;        •    place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and        •    limit our ability to borrow additional funds.    If additional debt financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to grow our business, take advantage of business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures or refinance maturing debt, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.    25    Table of Contents We will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.    Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts, including any strategic acquisitions we may make in the future, will depend on our ability to generate cash. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.    We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that our currently anticipated growth in revenue and cash flow will be realized on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the senior and senior subordinated notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Our senior secured credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries’ assets. As such, our ability to refinance our debt or seek additional financing could be limited by such security interest. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.    If the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel continues or if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses.    We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. We compete for nurses with hospitals and other health care providers. This nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations. If we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, or if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for our skilled clinical personnel, our operations and treatment growth will be negatively impacted, which would result in reduced revenues, earnings and cash flows.    The integration of DVA Renal Healthcare’s clinical, billing and collection systems into our operations is significant and the failure to successfully integrate the systems could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and operating results.    The integration of DVA Renal Healthcare requires the successful implementation of uniform information technology systems, including clinical, billing and collections systems. We may experience difficulties in our ability to successfully bill and collect for services rendered as a result of our upgrade and integration of the billing and collection systems. Complications associated with the integration of our clinical, billing and collections systems could cause increased risk of retractions from and refunds to commercial and government payors, noncompliance with reimbursement regulations and could have an adverse impact on the claims review required by DVA Renal Healthcare’s corporate integrity agreement. We may experience difficulties in effectively implementing these and other systems across our operations, including DVA Renal Healthcare. The failure to successfully integrate these and other systems could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and operating results.    If DVA Renal Healthcare does not comply with its corporate integrity agreement, or DVA Renal Healthcare otherwise has failed or fails to comply with government regulations applicable to its operations, we could be subject to additional penalties and otherwise may be materially harmed.    DVA Renal Healthcare entered into a settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States government relating to the Department of Justice’s investigation of DVA Renal Healthcare’s Medicare and Medicaid billing practices and its relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers. If DVA Renal Healthcare does not comply with the terms of the corporate integrity agreement or otherwise has failed or fails to comply with the extensive federal, state and local government regulations applicable to its operations, we could be subject to additional penalties, including monetary penalties or     26    Table of Contents  exclusion from participation in government programs, and otherwise may be materially harmed. The costs associated with compliance with the corporate integrity agreement and cooperation with the government are substantial and may be greater than we currently experience. In addition, as a result of the settlement agreement, commercial payors and other third parties may initiate legal proceedings against DVA Renal Healthcare related to the billing practices and other matters covered by the settlement agreement.    Our alliance and product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc. may limit our ability to achieve cost savings with respect to products and equipment we are required to purchase under this agreement.    On August 25, 2006, we amended our alliance and product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc., a subsidiary of Gambro AB, pursuant to which we are required to purchase from Gambro Renal Products specified percentages of hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices. The amended supply agreement, among other things, reduces our purchase obligations with respect to our requirements for such products, supplies and equipment and permits the termination of our obligations with respect to certain products under certain circumstances. The amended supply agreement continues to require us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis product supplies and equipment at fixed prices and may limit our ability to realize future cost savings in regard to products and equipment for which we remain obligated to make purchases under the agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2006, our total spending on hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment with Gambro Renal Products was approximately 4% of our total operating costs.    Our ability to effectively provide the services we offer could be negatively impacted if certain of our suppliers are unable to meet our needs, which could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    We have significant suppliers that are either the sole or primary source of products critical to the services we provide or to which we have committed obligations to make purchases, including Amgen, Gambro Renal Products, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, as well as others. If any of these suppliers are unable to meet our needs for the products they supply and we are not able to find adequate alternative sources, our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be substantially reduced.    Provisions in our charter documents, compensation programs and Delaware law may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests.    Our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent, requiring 90 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval. In addition, on November 14, 2002, the Board of Directors approved a shareholder rights plan that would substantially dilute the interest sought by an acquirer that our Board of Directors does not approve.    Most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We also maintain a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock awards, which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control which has been in place since September 2001. Based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on December 31, 2006, these cash bonuses would total approximately $231 million if a control transaction occurred at that price and our Board of Directors did not modify this program. These compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay for the Company.    27    Table of Contents We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law that, subject to exceptions, would prohibit us from engaging in any business combinations with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder.    These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company at a price that our stockholders may find attractive. These provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.
