Item 1A. Risk Factors.    This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including the risks discussed below. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in Item 7 under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation”.    If the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Approximately 35% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were generated from patients who have commercial payors as the primary payor. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that pay us on terms and at rates that are generally significantly higher than Medicare rates. The payments we receive from commercial payors generate nearly all of our profit. We are experiencing a decrease in some of our commercial payment rates and it is possible that commercial payment rates could be materially lower in the future. The downward pressure on commercial payment rates is a result of general conditions in the market, recent and future consolidations among commercial payors, increased focus on dialysis services and other factors.    We are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors, and payors are increasingly aggressive in their negotiations with us. In the event that our continued negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, the cumulative effect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Consolidations have significantly increased the negotiating leverage of commercial payors. We expect that some of our contracted rates with commercial payors may decrease or that we may experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. In addition to increasing downward pressure on contracted commercial payor rates, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on non-contracted or out-of-network providers. We, along with others in the kidney care community, are resisting such activity through regulatory, legislative and legal means. Decreases in out-of-network rates and restrictions on out-of-network access combined with decreases in contracted rates could result in a significant decrease in our overall revenue derived from commercial payors. If the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    If the number of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced.    Our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our patients with higher-paying commercial insurance coverage. A patient’s insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the patient’s or a family member’s employment status. Currently, for a patient covered by an employer group health plan, Medicare generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, or earlier, if the patient’s employer group health plan coverage terminates. When Medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rate we receive for that patient shifts from the employer group health plan rate to the lower Medicare payment rate. In addition, our continued negotiations with commercial payors could result in a decrease in the number of patients under commercial plans. If there is a significant reduction in the number of patients under higher-paying commercial plans relative to government-based programs that pay at lower rates, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Changes in the structure of, and payment rates under the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Approximately one-half of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 was generated from patients who have Medicare as their primary payor. Currently the Medicare ESRD     19     program pays us for dialysis treatment services at a fixed composite rate. The Medicare composite rate is the payment rate for a dialysis treatment including the supplies used in those treatments, specified laboratory tests and certain pharmaceuticals. Other services and certain pharmaceuticals, including EPO, vitamin D analogs and iron supplements, are separately billed.    In July 2008, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act for 2008 was passed by Congress. This legislation provides for an increase in the composite rate of 1% in 2009 and in 2010. In addition this legislation introduces a new payment system for dialysis services beginning in January 2011 whereby ESRD payments will be made under a bundled payment rate which will provide for a fixed rate for all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including laboratory services and the administration of pharmaceuticals. The initial 2011 bundled rate will be set 2% below the payment rate that providers would have received under the historical fee for service payment methodology. Beginning in 2012, a new single bundled payment base rate will be adjusted annually for inflation based upon a market basket index, less 1% of such index. The bundled payment rate will be determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who will have discretion to determine the base payment rate based on the goods and services included in the bundled rate. Dialysis providers will have the option to move fully to the bundled payment system in 2011 or to phase in the payment system over three years.    We experience increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in Medicare payment rates. The composite rate adjustment provided for in 2009 and 2010 will not be sufficient to compensate for the increases that we are likely to experience in operating costs that are subject to inflation. Because the bundled rates that will take effect in 2011 have not been set, we cannot predict whether the established rates, combined with the proposed negative adjustments, will be sufficient to compensate for increases in our operating costs that are subject to inflation. To the extent the Medicare bundled rates are established at levels that result in lower overall reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Changes in state Medicaid programs or payment rates could reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Approximately 4% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, was generated from patients who have Medicaid as their primary coverage. As state governments face increasing budgetary pressure, they may propose reductions in payment rates, delays in the timing of payments, limitations on eligibility or other changes to Medicaid programs. Some states have already taken steps to reduce or delay payments. In addition, Medicaid eligibility requirements mandate that citizen enrollees in Medicaid programs provide documented proof of citizenship. Our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that we are not paid by Medicaid or other state programs for services provided to patients that are unable to satisfy the eligibility requirements, including undocumented patients living in the U.S. If state governments reduce the rates paid by Medicaid programs for dialysis and related services, delay the timing of payment for services provided, further limit eligibility for Medicaid coverage or adopt changes to the Medicaid payment structure which reduces our overall payments from Medicaid, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected.    Changes in clinical practices and payment rates or rules for EPO and other pharmaceuticals could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    The administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals accounted for approximately 30% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, with EPO accounting for approximately 20% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Changes in clinical practices that result in decreased utilization of prescribed pharmaceuticals or changes in payment rates for those pharmaceuticals could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    20    Since late 2006, there has been significant media discussion and government scrutiny regarding anemia management practices in the United States which has created confusion and concern in the nephrology community. In late 2006, the House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing on the issue of EPO utilization and in 2007, the FDA required changes to the labeling of EPO and Aranesp® to include a black box warning, the FDA’s strongest form of warning label. The FDA has held additional hearings to revisit these label changes as they apply to ESRD and continues to examine the issue. CMS also reviewed its EPO reimbursement policies and in January 2008, changes to the EPO monitoring policy went into effect which further limit reimbursement and which have impacted the prescribing habits of our physicians resulting in lower pharmaceutical intensities. Commercial payors have also increasingly examined their administration policies for EPO and, in some cases have modified those policies. Further changes in labeling of other pharmaceuticals in a manner that alters physician practice patterns or accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental payment criteria, including the introduction of EPO administration policies or the conversion to alternate types of administration of EPO or other pharmaceuticals that result in further decreases in utilization or reimbursement for EPO could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Changes in EPO pricing and the use and marketing of alternatives to EPO could materially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients.    Amgen Inc. is the sole supplier of EPO and may unilaterally decide to increase its price for EPO at any time during the term of our contract. Future changes in the cost of EPO could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows and ultimately reduce our income. Although our agreement with Amgen for EPO includes potential rebates which depend upon the achievement of certain criteria, we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the rebates for EPO that we currently receive, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of rebates within that structure as we have historically achieved. Our agreement with Amgen provides for specific rebates off of list price based on a combination of factors, including process improvement and data submission. Factors that could impact our ability to qualify for rebates provided for in our agreement with Amgen in the future include our ability to develop and implement certain process improvements and track certain data elements. Failure to meet certain targets and earn the specified rebates could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.    Amgen has developed and obtained FDA approval for Aranesp®, a pharmaceutical used to treat anemia that may replace EPO or reduce its use with dialysis patients. Unlike EPO, which is generally administered in conjunction with each dialysis treatment, Aranesp® is administered less frequently. In the event that Aranesp® or any future alternatives to EPO are marketed for the treatment of dialysis patients, we may realize lower margins on the administration of such pharmaceuticals than are currently realized with EPO. A significant increase in the development and use of similar alternatives to EPO, or a change in administration practices, could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    We are the subject of a number of inquiries by the federal government, any of which could result in substantial penalties against us.    We are the subject of a number of inquiries by the federal government. We have received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas. We are cooperating with the U.S. Attorney’s Offices with respect to each of the subpoenas and producing the requested records. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and, in certain cases, criminal penalties. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoenas will continue to require management’s attention and significant legal expense. See “Item 3—Legal Proceedings” for additional information regarding these inquiries and subpoenas.    21    Continued inquiries from various governmental bodies with respect to our utilization of EPO and other pharmaceuticals will require management’s attention, cause us to incur significant legal expense and could result in substantial financial penalties against us or exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    In response to clinical studies which identified risks in certain patient populations related to the utilization of EPO and other erythropoesis-stimulating agents, i.e., Aranesp®, and in response to changes in the labeling of EPO and Aranesp®, there has been substantial media attention and government scrutiny resulting in hearings and legislation regarding utilization and reimbursement. Although we believe our anemia management practices and other pharmaceutical administration practices have been compliant with existing laws and regulations, as a result of the current high level of scrutiny and controversy, we may be subject to increased inquiries from a variety of governmental bodies and claims by third parties. For example, the subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia relates to the pharmaceutical products Zemplar, Hectorol, Venofer, Ferrlicit, EPO and other related matters. The subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Eastern District of Missouri includes requests for documents regarding the administration of, and billing for, EPO. The subpoena from the Office of Inspector General in Houston, Texas requests records relating to EPO claims submitted to Medicare. In addition, in February 2008 the Attorney General’s Office for the State of Nevada notified us that Nevada Medicaid intends to conduct audits of ESRD providers in Nevada relating to the billing of pharmaceuticals, including EPO, and in 2007, a complaint was filed against us, Amgen and Fresenius Medical Care Holdings by Sheet Metal Workers National Health Fund and Glenn Randle alleging claims related to the administration and use of EPO. Additional inquiries from various agencies and claims by third parties with respect to this issue would continue to require management’s attention and significant legal expense and any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us or exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. See “Item 3—Legal Proceedings” for additional information regarding these inquiries and subpoenas.    If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations, federal and state anti-kickback laws, the Stark II physician self-referral prohibition and analogous state referral statutes, and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information. The Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules related to claims submission, licensing requirements, cost reporting, and payment processes impose complex and extensive requirements upon dialysis providers, and a violation or departure from such requirements may result in government audits, lower reimbursements, recoupments or voluntary repayments, and the potential loss of certification.    The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers continues to increase. Medicare has increased the frequency and intensity of its certification inspections of dialysis centers. For example, we are required to provide substantial documentation related to the administration of pharmaceuticals, including EPO, and, to the extent that any such documentation is found insufficient, we may be required to refund any amounts received from such administration by government or commercial payors, and be subject to substantial penalties under applicable laws or regulations. In addition, fiscal intermediaries have increased their prepayment and post-payment reviews.    We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid payments and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with state and federal anti-kickback laws and the Stark II physician self-referral law. However, the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations. For example, if an enforcement agency were to challenge the level of compensation that we pay our medical directors, we could be required to change our practices, face criminal or civil penalties, pay substantial fines or otherwise experience a material adverse effect as a result of a challenge to these arrangements.    22    Because of regulatory considerations unique to New York, all of our dialysis operations in New York are conducted by privately-owned companies to which we provide a broad range of administrative services. These operations accounted for approximately 3% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. In 2007, changes to New York law were adopted that will permit us to hold licenses to conduct dialysis business directly, but until these changes are implemented and these operating licenses are transferred to us, we can give no assurances that these arrangements will not be challenged.    If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows including:        •    Suspension or termination of our participation in government payment programs;      •    Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable payment program requirements;      •    Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government payment programs;      •    Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate;      •    Reductions in payment rates or coverage for dialysis and ancillary services and related pharmaceuticals;      •    Fines, damages or monetary penalties for anti-kickback law violations, Stark Law violations, submission of false claims, civil or criminal liability based on violations of law, or other failures to meet regulatory requirements;      •    Claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws;      •    Mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses; and      •    Termination of relationships with medical directors.    If our joint ventures were found to violate the law, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    As of December 31, 2008, we owned a controlling interest in numerous dialysis related joint ventures, which represented approximately 15% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. In addition, we also owned a noncontrolling interest in several other dialysis related joint ventures. We anticipate that we will continue to increase the number of our joint ventures. Many of our joint ventures with physicians or physician groups also have the physician owners providing medical director services to those centers or other centers we own and operate. Because our relationships with physicians are governed by the federal anti-kickback statute, we have sought to structure our joint venture arrangements to satisfy as many safe harbor requirements as we believe are reasonably possible. However, our joint venture arrangements do not satisfy all elements of any safe harbor under the federal anti-kickback statute. The subpoena and related requests for documents we received from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri included requests for documents related to our joint ventures.    If our joint ventures are found to be in violation of the anti-kickback statute or the Stark Law provisions, we could be required to restructure the joint ventures or refuse to accept referrals for designated health services from the physicians with whom the joint venture centers have a financial relationship.    We also could be required to repay amounts received by the joint ventures from Medicare and certain other payors to the extent that these arrangements are found to give rise to prohibited referrals, and we could be subject to monetary penalties and exclusion from government healthcare programs. If our joint venture centers are subject to any of these penalties, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of dialysis revenue that we recognize and if we are unable to accurately estimate our revenue, it could impact the timing of our revenue recognition or have a significant impact on our operating results.    There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of dialysis and related lab services revenues that we recognize in a reporting period. Ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage     23     differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for approximately 112,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverage that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes and errors in determining the correct coordination of benefits may result in refunds to payors. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are also subject to estimating risk related to the amounts not paid by the primary government payor that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage, the patient’s commercial health plan secondary coverage or the patient. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 6% of operating income. If our estimates of dialysis and related lab services revenues are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing of our revenue recognition and have a significant impact on our operating results.    The ancillary services we provide or the strategic initiatives we invest in may generate losses and may ultimately be unsuccessful. In the event that one or more of these activities is unsuccessful, we may have to write off our investment and incur other exit costs.    Our ancillary services and strategic initiatives include infusion therapy services, pharmacy services, vascular access services, disease management services, physician services, ESRD clinical research programs and ESRD special needs plans. Many of these initiatives require investments of both management and financial resources and can generate significant losses for a substantial period of time and may not become profitable. There can be no assurance that any such strategic initiative will ultimately be successful. For example, during 2008 and 2007, our VillageHealth and pharmacy initiatives generated net operating losses and are expected to generate net operating losses into 2009. If any of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives do not perform as planned, we may incur a material write-off of our investment in one or more of these activities.    If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical director of the center. As a result, the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. Neither our current nor former medical directors have an obligation to refer their patients to our centers. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, and a new medical director is appointed, it may negatively impact the former medical director’s decision to treat his or her patients at our center. If we are unable to enforce noncompetition provisions contained in the terminated medical director agreements, former medical directors may choose to provide medical director services for competing providers or establish their own dialysis centers in competition with ours. Also, if the quality of service levels at our centers deteriorates, it may negatively impact patient referrals and treatment volumes.    Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally three to ten years. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. We may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships to assure compliance with the safe harbor provisions of the anti-kickback statute, Stark Law and other similar laws. These actions could negatively impact the decision of physicians to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us. If the terms of any existing agreement are found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship which could lead to the early termination of the agreement, or cause the physician to stop referring patients to our dialysis centers. If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced.    24    Delays in state Medicare and Medicaid certification of our dialysis centers could adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Before we can begin billing for patients treated in our outpatient dialysis centers who are enrolled in government-based programs, we are required to obtain state and federal certification for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. As state governments face increasing budgetary pressure, certain states are having difficulty certifying dialysis centers in the normal course resulting in significant delays in certification. For example, the state of Texas has stopped certifying dialysis centers and has communicated that it will not certify dialysis centers in 2009 and the state of California is experiencing significant delays. If state governments continue to have difficulty certifying new centers in the normal course and we continue to experience significant delays in our ability to treat and bill for services provided to patients covered under government programs, it could cause us to incur write-offs of investments or accelerate the recognition of lease obligations in the event we have to close centers or our centers’ operating performance deteriorates, and it could have an adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Current economic conditions, including the current recession in the United States and the worldwide economic slowdown, as well as further disruptions in the financial markets could result in substantial declines in our revenues, earnings, cash flows and financial condition.    The current economic recession in the United States and worldwide economic slowdown, could adversely affect our business and our profitability. Among other things, the potential decline in federal and state revenues that may result from such conditions may create additional pressures to contain or reduce reimbursements for our services from Medicare, Medicaid and other government sponsored programs. The potential increase in job losses in the United States which may occur in the near future if the economy continues to decline could result in a smaller percentage of our patients being covered by an employer group health plan and a larger percentage being covered by lower paying Medicare and Medicaid programs. Employers may also begin to select more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates. To the extent that payors are negatively impacted by a decline in the economy, we may experience further pressure on commercial rates, slow down in collections and a reduction in the amounts we expect to collect. In addition, if the current turmoil in the financial markets continues, the variable interest rates payable under our credit facilities could be adversely affected or it could be more difficult to obtain or renew such facilities in the future. Any or all of these factors, as well as other consequences of the current economic conditions which cannot currently be anticipated, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.    If we are not able to continue to make acquisitions on reasonable terms, or maintain an acceptable level of non-acquired growth, or if we face significant patient attrition to our competitors, it could adversely affect our business.    We are facing increased competition in the dialysis industry from large and medium-sized providers which compete directly with us for acquisition targets as well as for individual patients and medical directors. Acquisitions, patient retention and medical director retention are an important part of our growth strategy. If we are not able to continue to make acquisitions on reasonable terms, continue to maintain acceptable levels of non-acquired growth, or if we face significant patient attrition to our competitors, it could adversely affect our business.    The level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business.    We have substantial debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The high level of our indebtedness, among other things, could:        •    make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt securities;      •    increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;    25        •    require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;      •    expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent we have variable rate debt;      •    limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;      •    place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and      •    limit our ability to borrow additional funds.    If additional debt financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to grow our business, take advantage of business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures or refinance maturing debt, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.    Increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our profitability and cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness.    We are subject to interest rate volatility associated with the portions of our borrowings that bear interest at variable rates. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $1.9 billion outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which bears interest at a variable rate. Approximately $0.8 billion of our outstanding debt is subject to interest rate swaps which have the economic effect of fixing the interest rate on an equivalent portion of our debt. The remaining variable rate debt outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities had a weighted average interest rate of 1.97% at December 31, 2008. In addition, we have approximately $199 million of available borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities that would bear interest at the LIBOR-based variable rate plus an interest rate margin of 1.50%. We may also incur additional variable rate debt in the future.    Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense for the variable portion of our indebtedness, which could negatively impact our earnings and cash flow. For example, it is estimated that a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities would have reduced net income by approximately $7.1 million, $5.5 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. See “Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for more information. In addition, if we seek to refinance our existing indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms and conditions, which could increase our interest expense or impair our ability to service our indebtedness and fund our operations.    We will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.    Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts, including any strategic acquisitions we may make in the future, will depend on our ability to generate cash. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.    We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the senior and senior subordinated notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries’ assets. As such, our ability to refinance our debt or seek additional financing could be limited by such security interest. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.    26    If the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel continues or if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses.    We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. We compete for nurses with hospitals and other health care providers. This nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations. If we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, or if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for our skilled clinical personnel, our operations and treatment growth will be negatively impacted, which would result in reduced revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Our business is labor intensive and could be adversely affected if we were unable to maintain satisfactory relations with our employees or if union organizing activities were to result in significant increases in our operating costs or decreases in productivity.    Our business is labor intensive, and our results are subject to variations in labor-related costs and productivity. If the recent national and local elections result in actions or proposals that increase the likelihood of union organizing activities at our facilities, our operating costs could increase and our employee relations, productivity, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected.    Our alliance and product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc. may limit our ability to achieve cost savings with respect to products and equipment we are required to purchase under this agreement.    Our obligations under our alliance and product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products to purchase dialyzers and certain other products, may limit our ability to realize future cost savings in regard to certain products. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our total spending on hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment with Gambro Renal Products was approximately 2% of our total operating costs.    Upgrades to our billing and collections systems and complications associated with upgrades and other improvements to our billing and collections systems could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and operating results.    We are continuously performing upgrades on our billing systems and expect to continue to do so in 2009. In addition, we continuously work to improve our billing and collections performance through process upgrades, organizational changes and other improvements. We may experience difficulties in our ability to successfully bill and collect for services rendered as a result of these changes, including a slow-down of collections, a reduction in the amounts we expect to collect, increased risk of retractions from and refunds to commercial and government payors, an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts receivable and noncompliance with reimbursement regulations. These changes could also have an adverse impact on the claims review required by the corporate integrity agreement applicable to the centers acquired from Gambro Healthcare, described below. The failure to successfully implement the upgrades to the billing and collection systems and other improvements could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and operating results.    If DVA Renal Healthcare does not comply with the corporate integrity agreement applicable to the centers acquired from Gambro Healthcare, or DVA Renal Healthcare otherwise has failed or fails to comply with government regulations applicable to its operations, we could be subject to additional penalties and otherwise may be materially harmed.    In 2004, Gambro Healthcare entered into a settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States government relating to the Department of Justice’s investigation of Gambro Healthcare’s Medicare and Medicaid billing practices and its relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers. If DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly Gambro Healthcare) does not comply with the terms of the corporate integrity agreement applicable to the centers acquired from Gambro Healthcare, or otherwise has failed     27     or fails to comply with the extensive federal, state and local government regulations applicable to its operations, we could be subject to additional penalties, including monetary penalties or exclusion from participation in government programs, and otherwise may be materially harmed. The costs associated with compliance with the corporate integrity agreement and cooperation with the government are substantial and may increase. In addition, as a result of the settlement agreement, some commercial payors and other third parties have initiated legal proceedings against DVA Renal Healthcare related to the billing practices and other matters covered by the settlement agreement and we could receive similar claims in the future.    Our ability to effectively provide the services we offer could be negatively impacted if certain of our suppliers are unable to meet our needs or if we are unable to effectively access new technology, which could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    We have significant suppliers that are either the sole or primary source of products critical to the services we provide or to which we have committed obligations to make purchases, including Amgen, Fresenius Medical Care, Gambro Renal Products, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, NxStage, as well as others. If any of these suppliers are unable to meet our needs for the products they supply, including in the event of a product recall, and we are not able to find adequate alternative sources, our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be substantially reduced. For example, in February 2008, Baxter Healthcare Corporation proceeded with a recall of heparin, a pharmaceutical used in the treatment of dialysis patients and ceased further sales. As a result of the recall, there is only one remaining supplier of heparin and the cost to purchase heparin has significantly increased. It is possible that our heparin costs may continue to increase and since there is no separate reimbursement for this drug under Medicare, cost increases have a direct impact on our profitability. An affiliate of Fresenius Medical Care acquired this sole remaining provider of heparin for the U.S. dialysis market. This could negatively impact our access to and pricing for this critical product. In addition, the technology related to the products critical to the services we provide is subject to new developments and may result in superior products. If we are not able to access superior products on a cost-effective basis or if suppliers are not able to fulfill our requirements for such products, we could face patient attrition which could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    We may be subject to liability claims for damages and other expenses not covered by insurance that could reduce our earnings and cash flows.    The administration of dialysis and related services to patients may subject us to litigation and liability for damages. Our business, profitability and growth prospects could suffer if we face negative publicity or we pay damages or defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of any applicable insurance coverage, including claims related to contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims. In addition, we have received several notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties related to our historical billing practices and the historical billing practices of the centers acquired from Gambro Healthcare and other matters related to their settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted, an adverse result with respect to one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We currently maintain programs of general and professional liability insurance. However, a successful claim, including a professional liability, malpractice or negligence claim which is in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.    In addition, if our costs of insurance and claims increase, then our earnings could decline. Market rates for insurance premiums and deductibles have been steadily increasing. Our earnings and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following:        •    the collapse or insolvency of our insurance carriers;      •    further increases in premiums and deductibles;      •    increases in the number of liability claims against us or the cost of settling or trying cases related to those claims; and      •    an inability to obtain one or more types of insurance on acceptable terms.    28    If businesses we acquire have liabilities that we are not aware of, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Our business strategy includes the acquisition of dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers, as well as other ancillary services and strategic initiatives. Businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities or liabilities that are in excess of the amounts that we originally estimated. Although we generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire for matters that are not properly disclosed to us, we are not always successful. In addition, even in cases where we are able to obtain indemnification, we may discover liabilities greater than the contractual limits or the financial resources of the indemnifying party. In the event that we are responsible for liabilities substantially in excess of any amounts recovered through rights to indemnification, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.    Provisions in our charter documents, compensation programs and Delaware law may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests.    Our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent; requiring 90 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors; and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval. In addition, we have in place a shareholder rights plan that would substantially dilute the interest sought by an acquirer that our Board of Directors does not approve.    Most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We also maintain a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock awards, which has been in place since 2001, and which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the market price of our common stock and shares outstanding on December 31, 2008, these cash bonuses would total approximately $198 million if a change of control transaction occurred at that price and our Board of Directors did not modify this program. These change of control provisions may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay for our Company.    We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law that, subject to exceptions, would prohibit us from engaging in any business combinations with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder.    These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company at a price that our stockholders may find attractive. These provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.
