ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risk Factors Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer, possibly materially. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could fall. WE EXPECT TO INCUR FUTURE LOSSES, AND WE MAY NEVER BECOME PROFITABLE. We have incurred significant operating losses each year since our inception, including net losses of $206.9 million, $203.4 million and $166.2 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and expect to incur a significant operating loss in 2007. We believe that operating losses will continue beyond 2007, even if we receive significant future payments under our existing and future collaborative agreements, because we are planning to make significant investments in research and development, and because we will incur significant selling, general and administrative expenses in the course of researching, developing and commercializing our drug candidates. These net losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on, among other things, our stockholders’ equity, total assets and working capital. We expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and that such fluctuations may be substantial. We cannot predict when we will become profitable, if at all. WE DEPEND HEAVILY ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR LEAD DRUG CANDIDATE, TELAPREVIR, WHICH IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE TELAPREVIR, OR EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN DOING SO, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE MATERIALLY HARMED. We are investing a significant portion of our time, personnel and financial resources in the development of telaprevir, which is currently in Phase 2b clinical trials. The clinical development and commercial success of telaprevir will depend on several factors, including the following: · successful completion and favorable outcome of clinical trials; · ongoing discussions with the FDA and comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope and design of our clinical trials; · receipt and timing of marketing approvals for telaprevir from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities; · establishing and maintaining commercial manufacturing arrangements for telaprevir with third-party manufacturers; · launching commercial sales of telaprevir by us and our collaborators; and · acceptance of telaprevir, if approved, in the medical community and with third-party payors. If the data from our ongoing clinical trials or non-clinical studies regarding the safety or efficacy of telaprevir are not favorable, we may be forced to delay or terminate the clinical development of telaprevir, which would materially harm our business. Further, even if we gain marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities in a timely manner, we cannot be sure that telaprevir will be accepted by purchasers in the pharmaceutical market. If the results of clinical trials of telaprevir, the anticipated or actual timing of marketing approvals for telaprevir, or the market acceptance of telaprevir, if approved, do not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. 33    MANY OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES ARE STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, AND ALL OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES REMAIN SUBJECT TO CLINICAL TESTING AND REGULATORY APPROVAL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND TEST OUR DRUG CANDIDATES, WE WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability, and our collaborators’ ability, to develop and commercialize our drug candidates, including telaprevir, successfully. Our drug candidates are in various stages of development and must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for sale. To satisfy these standards, we and/or our collaborators must engage in expensive and lengthy testing of our drug candidates. Despite our efforts, our drug candidates may not: · offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing competitive drugs; · be proven safe and effective in clinical trials; · meet applicable regulatory standards; · be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs; or · if approved for commercial sale, be successfully commercialized. Positive results in preclinical studies of a drug candidate may not be predictive of similar results in humans during clinical trials, and promising results from earlier clinical trials of a drug candidate may not be replicated in later clinical trials. Findings in nonclinical studies conducted concurrently with clinical trials could result in abrupt changes in our development activities, including the possible cessation of development activities associated with a drug candidate. Furthermore, results from our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for approval of a drug candidate. We and many other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in early-stage development. Accordingly, the results from the completed preclinical studies and clinical trials and ongoing clinical trials for our drug candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later stage trials, and may not be predictive of the likelihood of approval of a drug candidate for commercial sale. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN UNITED STATES AND/OR FOREIGN REGULATORY APPROVAL, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG CANDIDATES. Our drug candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to their development, clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required in the United States and in most other countries prior to the commercial sale of our drug candidates. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. It is possible that none of the drug candidates we are developing independently, or in collaboration with others, will be approved for marketing. We have limited experience in conducting and managing the late-stage clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA. The time required to complete clinical trials and for the FDA and other countries’ regulatory review processes is uncertain and typically takes many years. Our analysis of data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may also encounter unanticipated delays or increased costs due to government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy during the period of drug development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. Any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize any drug candidate. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a drug may be subject to unexpected limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the drug. These limitations may limit the size of the market for the drug. 34     We are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign requirements. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States. Foreign jurisdictions may have different approval procedures than those required by the FDA and may impose additional testing requirements for our drug candidates. IF CLINICAL TRIALS FOR OUR DRUG CANDIDATES ARE PROLONGED OR DELAYED, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG CANDIDATES ON A TIMELY BASIS, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND WOULD DELAY OUR RECEIPT OF ANY PRODUCT REVENUE. We cannot predict whether or not we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials, or delay the analysis of data from our completed or ongoing clinical trials. Any of the following could delay the clinical development of our drug candidates: · ongoing discussions with the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials; · delays in receiving or the inability to obtain required approvals from the independent institutional review board at one or more of the institutions at which a clinical trial is conducted or other reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials; · delays in enrolling volunteers or patients into clinical trials; · a lower than anticipated retention rate of volunteers or patients in clinical trials; · the need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive results or unforeseen complications in testing; · inadequate supply or deficient quality of drug candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials; · unfavorable FDA inspection and review of a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation; · serious and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials; or · the placement by the FDA of a clinical hold on a trial. Our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis will be subject to a number of factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the number of other clinical trials competing for patients in the same indication and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. In addition, subjects may drop out of our clinical trials, and thereby possibly impair the validity or statistical significance of the trials. Delays in patient enrollment or unforeseen drop-out rates may result in increased costs and longer development times. While all or a portion of these additional costs may be covered by payments under our collaborative agreements, we bear all of the costs for our development candidates for which we have no financial support from a collaborator. We, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time if we or they believe the subjects or patients participating in such clinical trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons. In addition, it is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. If we experience any such problems, we may not have the financial resources to continue development of the drug candidate that is affected or the development of any of our other drug candidates. 35    IF OUR COMPETITORS BRING SUPERIOR DRUGS TO MARKET OR BRING THEIR DRUGS TO MARKET BEFORE WE DO, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND A MARKET FOR OUR DRUG CANDIDATES. Our drug candidates in development may not be able to compete effectively with drugs that are currently on the market or new drugs that may be developed by others. There are many other companies developing drugs for the same indications that we are pursuing in development. In order to compete successfully in these areas, we must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy and ease of manufacturing and gain market acceptance over competing drugs that may receive regulatory approval before or after our drug candidates, and over those that currently are marketed. Many of our competitors, including major pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, Wyeth, Pfizer, Roche, Amgen, Novartis, Johnson & Johnson and Schering-Plough possess substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we possess. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in conducting preclinical and nonclinical testing and human clinical trials of drug candidates, scaling up manufacturing operations and obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and manufacturing facilities. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for drugs more rapidly than we do. If we obtain regulatory approval and launch commercial sales of our drug candidates, we also will compete with respect to manufacturing efficiency and sales and marketing capabilities, areas in which we currently have limited experience. IF OUR PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS ARE NOT COMPLIANT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO DELAYS IN FILING NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETING OF DRUGS AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN APPROVED. We currently are developing drug candidates for regulatory approval for the first time since our inception, and are in the process of implementing regulated processes and systems required to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our drug candidates. Certain of these processes and systems for conducting clinical trials and manufacturing material must be compliant with regulatory requirements before we can apply for regulatory approval for our drug candidates. These processes and systems will be subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. If we are unable to achieve compliance in a timely fashion, we may experience delays in filing for regulatory approval for our drug candidates. In addition, any later discovery of previously unknown problems or safety issues with approved drugs or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on such drugs or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of drugs from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or a refusal by the FDA and/or other regulatory bodies to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we are a party to collaboration agreements that transfer responsibility for complying with specified regulatory requirements, such as filing and maintenance of marketing authorizations and safety reporting, to our collaborator. If our collaborators do not fulfill these regulatory obligations, any drugs for which we or they obtain approval may be withdrawn from the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. EVEN IF WE OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS, OUR DRUG CANDIDATES WILL BE SUBJECT TO ONGOING REGULATORY REVIEW. IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH CONTINUING UNITED STATES AND APPLICABLE FOREIGN REGULATIONS, WE COULD LOSE THOSE APPROVALS, AND OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED. Even if we receive regulatory approval of any drug candidates that we are developing, we will be subject to continuing regulatory review, including the review of clinical results that are reported after our drug candidates become commercially available, approved drugs. Since drugs are more widely used by patients once approval has been obtained, side effects and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated during pre-approval clinical trials. In addition, the manufacturers and the manufacturing facilities we engage to make any of our drug candidates will also be subject to periodic  36    review and inspection by the FDA. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the drug, manufacturers or manufacturing facilities may result in restrictions on the drug, manufacturers or facilities, including withdrawal of the drug from the market or our inability to use the facilities to make our drug. If we fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. OUR DRUG DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE DATA-DRIVEN AND THEREFORE POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO ABRUPT CHANGES IN EXPECTED OUTCOMES. Small molecule drug discovery and development involve, initially, the identification of chemical compounds that may have promise as treatments for specific diseases. Once identified as drug candidates, compounds are subjected to years of testing in a laboratory setting, in animals and in humans. Our ultimate objective is to determine whether the drug candidates have physical characteristics, both intrinsically and in animal and human systems and include a toxicological profile, that are compatible with clinical and commercial success in treatment of the disease being targeted. Throughout this process, experiments are conducted and data are gathered that could reinforce a decision to move to the next step in the investigation process for a particular drug candidate, could result in uncertainty over the proper course to pursue, or could result in the termination of further drug development efforts with respect to the compound being evaluated. We monitor the results of our discovery research and our nonclinical studies and clinical trials and regularly evaluate and re-evaluate our portfolio investments with the objective of balancing risk and potential return in view of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights. This process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information comes to light and we gain additional insights into ongoing programs and potential new programs. WE DEPEND ON OUR COLLABORATORS TO WORK WITH US TO DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE AND COMMERCIALIZE MANY OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES. We have granted development and commercialization rights to telaprevir to Janssen (worldwide other than North America and Far East) and to Mitsubishi (Far East). We also have granted Far East rights to VX-702 to our collaborator Kissei. We expect to receive significant financial support under our Janssen collaboration agreement, as well as meaningful technical and manufacturing contributions to the telaprevir program. The success of some of our key in-house programs, such as for telaprevir and VX-702, is dependent upon the continued financial and other support that our collaborators have agreed to provide. For some drug candidates on which we are not currently focusing our development efforts, we have granted worldwide rights to a collaborator, such as our MK-0457 (VX-680) and MK-6592 (VX-667) collaboration with Merck, our Lexiva/Telzir and VX-409 collaborations with GlaxoSmithKline and our AVN-944 (VX-944) collaboration with Avalon. The success of our collaborations depends on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Each of our collaborators has significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that it will apply to the collaboration. Our existing collaborations may not be scientifically or commercially successful. The risks that we face in connection with these existing and any future collaborations include the following: · Our collaboration agreements are subject to termination under various circumstances, including, as in the case of our agreement with Janssen, termination without cause. Any such termination could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition and/or delay the development and commercial sale of our drug candidates, including telaprevir. · Our collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies historically have re-evaluated their development and commercialization priorities following mergers and consolidations, which have been common in recent years in these industries. The ability of some of our drug candidates to reach their potential  37    could be limited if our collaborators decrease or fail to increase development or commercialization efforts related to those drug candidates. · Our collaboration agreements may have the effect of limiting the areas of research and development that we may pursue, either alone or in collaboration with third parties. · Our collaborators may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, drugs that are similar to or competitive with the drugs or drug candidates that are the subject of the collaboration with us. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN COLLABORATORS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR DRUGS AND DRUG CANDIDATES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FUND OUR DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES. Our collaborators have agreed to fund portions of our research and development programs and/or to conduct the development and commercialization of specified drug candidates and, if they are approved, drugs. In exchange, we have given them technology, sales and marketing rights relating to those drugs and drug candidates. Some of our corporate collaborators have rights to control the planning and execution of drug development and clinical programs including for our drug candidates MK-0457 (vx-680), MK-6592 (vx-667), VX-409 and AVN-944 (VX-944). Our collaborators may exercise their control rights in ways that may negatively affect the timing and success of those programs. Our collaborations are subject to termination rights by the collaborators. If any of our collaborators were to terminate its relationship with us, or fail to meet its contractual obligations, that action could have a material adverse effect on our ability to undertake research, to fund related and other programs and to develop, manufacture and market any drugs that may have resulted from the collaboration. We expect to seek additional collaborative arrangements, which may not be available to us, to develop and commercialize our drug candidates in the future. Even if we are able to establish acceptable collaborative arrangements in the future, they may not be successful. OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURE OF COMMERCIAL SUPPLY OF TELAPREVIR MAY NOT RESULT IN ANY BENEFIT TO US IF TELAPREVIR IS NOT APPROVED FOR COMMERCIAL SALE. We are investing significant resources in the clinical development of telaprevir. In 2006, we increased our investment in telaprevir to support our Phase 2b clinical development program. Telaprevir is the first drug candidate for which we expect to perform all activities related to late stage development, drug supply, registration and commercialization in a major market. Even though telaprevir is a Phase 2b drug candidate, we are planning for and investing significant resources now in preparation for Phase 3 clinical trials, application for marketing approval, commercial supply and sales and marketing. We also expect to incur significant costs in 2007 to manufacture registration batches and invest in telaprevir commercial supply. Our engagement in these resource-intensive activities could make it more difficult for us to maintain our portfolio focus, and puts significant investment at risk if we do not obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize telaprevir in North America. There is no assurance that our development of telaprevir will lead successfully to regulatory approval, or that obtaining regulatory approval will lead to commercial success. If telaprevir is not approved for commercial sale or if its development is delayed for any reason, our full investment in telaprevir may be at risk and our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. WE DEPEND ON THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS TO DISTRIBUTE CLINICAL TRIAL MATERIALS FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO RELY ON THEM TO MEET OUR COMMERCIAL SUPPLY NEEDS FOR ANY DRUG CANDIDATE THAT IS APPROVED FOR SALE. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN THESE RELATIONSHIPS AND ARE SUBJECT TO SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. If we are successful in advancing our proprietary drug candidates through clinical development, we plan to establish and maintain a commercial supply chain and build our logistics and quality control  38    capabilities. We currently are relying on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers to manufacture and distribute our drug candidates for clinical trials, and we expect that we will continue to do so to meet our commercial supply needs for these drugs, if they are approved for sale. As a result of our reliance on these third-party manufacturers and suppliers, including sole source suppliers of certain components of our drug candidates and drugs, we may be subject to significant supply disruptions outside of our control. We have retained manufacturing and commercialization responsibilities for telaprevir in North America. Establishing the commercial supply chain for telaprevir is a multi-step international endeavor involving the purchase of several raw materials, the application of certain manufacturing processes requiring significant lead times, the conversion of active pharmaceutical ingredient to tablet form and the packaging of tablets for distribution. We expect to source raw materials, drug substance and drug product, including finished packaging, from third parties located in the Far East, the European Union and the United States, and we are currently establishing and expanding third-party relationships in this regard. Establishing and providing quality assurance for this global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment, experienced personnel and the creation or expansion of numerous third-party contractual relationships. While we believe that there are multiple third parties that are capable of providing the materials and services that we need in order to manufacture and distribute telaprevir, if it is approved for sale, some of these services are in high demand and capacity is constrained. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish and maintain this commercial supply chain on commercially reasonable terms in order to support a timely launch of telaprevir or at all. We plan to identify and enter into commercial relationships with multiple third-party manufacturers in order to reduce the risk of supply chain disruption by limiting our reliance on any one manufacturer. In addition, we are in the process of transferring technical information regarding the manufacture of telaprevir to Janssen so that Janssen will be able to manufacture telaprevir, if approved, for sale in Janssen’s territories and as a secondary source for us. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to establish second sources for each stage of manufacturing of telaprevir, or any other drug or drug candidate, or that any second source will be able to produce sufficient quantities in the required timeframe to avoid a supply chain disruption if there is a problem with one of our suppliers. Even if we successfully establish arrangements with third-party manufacturers, supply disruptions may result from a number of factors including shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays or any other performance failure by any third-party manufacturer on which we rely. Any supply disruptions could impact the timing of our clinical trials and the commercial launch of any approved pharmaceutical drugs. Furthermore, we may be required to modify our production methods to permit us to economically manufacture our drugs for commercial launch and sale. Upon approval of a pharmaceutical drug for sale, if any, we similarly may be at risk of supply chain disruption for our commercial drug supply. These modifications may require us to reevaluate our resources and the resources of our third-party manufacturers, which could result in abrupt changes in our production methods and supplies. The production of our drug candidates is based in part on technology that we believe to be proprietary. We have licensed this technology to enable our third-party manufacturers to manufacture drug candidates for us. However, in the course of their services, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of our drug candidates that the manufacturer owns, either independently or jointly with us. This would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer in order to have our products manufactured by other suppliers utilizing the same process. WE RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO CONDUCT OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, AND THOSE THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT PERFORM SATISFACTORILY, INCLUDING FAILING TO MEET ESTABLISHED DEADLINES FOR THE COMPLETION OF SUCH TRIALS. We do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates, and we rely on third parties such as contract research organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators to  39    enroll qualified patients and conduct our clinical trials. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. Accordingly, these third-party contractors may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our trial design. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be required to replace them. Although we believe that there are a number of other third-party contractors we could engage to continue these activities, it may result in a delay of the affected trial. Accordingly, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidates may be delayed. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP INDEPENDENT SALES AND MARKETING CAPABILITIES OR ESTABLISH THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS FOR THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG CANDIDATES EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL. We currently have no experience as a company in sales and marketing or with respect to pricing and obtaining adequate third-party reimbursement for drugs. GlaxoSmithKline currently has exclusive sales and marketing rights to Lexiva/Telzir. We will need to either develop marketing capabilities and an independent sales force or enter into arrangements with third parties to sell and market any of our drug candidates if they are approved for sale by regulatory authorities.  In order to market telaprevir in North America if it is approved, we intend to build a marketing organization and a direct sales force, which will require substantial efforts and significant management and financial resources. During 2007, we intend to commit significant personnel and financial resources to this effort, staging our commitments to the extent possible in consideration of the ongoing telaprevir development timeline. We will need to devote significant effort, in particular, to recruiting individuals with experience in the sales and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Competition for personnel with these skills is intense and may be particularly difficult for us since telaprevir is still an investigational drug candidate. In addition, if we develop our own marketing and sales capability, we may be competing with other companies that currently have experienced and well-funded marketing and sales operations. As a result, we may not be able to successfully develop our own marketing capabilities or independent sales force for telaprevir in North America in order to support an effective launch of telaprevir if it is approved for sale. We have granted commercialization rights to other pharmaceutical companies with respect to certain of our drug candidates in certain geographic locations, including telaprevir (Janssen worldwide except for North America and the Far East, and Mitsubishi in the Far East), MK-0457 (VX-680) and MK-6592 (VX-667) (Merck worldwide) and AVN-944 (VX-944) (Avalon worldwide). To the extent that our collaborators have commercial rights to our drugs, any revenues we receive from any approved drugs, will depend primarily on the sales and marketing efforts of others. We do not know whether we will be able to enter into additional third-party sales and marketing arrangements with respect to any of our other drug candidates on acceptable terms, if at all, or whether we will be able to leverage the sales and marketing capabilities we intend to build for telaprevir in order to market and sell any other drug candidate if it is approved for sale. WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THAT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. We expect to incur substantial research and development and related supporting expenses as we design and develop existing and future compounds, undertake clinical trials of drug candidates resulting from such compounds, and build our manufacturing, regulatory, development and commercial capabilities. We also expect to incur substantial administrative and commercialization expenses in the future. We may need to make significant capital investment in building our manufacturing capacity and creating pre-launch inventory for one or more of our drug candidates. We anticipate that we will finance these substantial cash needs with: · cash received from our existing collaborative agreements; 40    · cash received from new collaborative agreements; · Lexiva/Telzir royalty revenue; · existing cash reserves, together with interest earned on those reserves; and · future product sales to the extent that we market drugs directly. We expect that funds from these sources will be sufficient to fund our planned activities for at least the next eighteen months from the date of this filing. If we need additional capital, it will be necessary to raise additional funds through public offerings or private placements of equity or debt securities or other methods of financing. Even if our financial resources are sufficient to meet our short or intermediate term needs, we may still decide, as we have in the past, to raise additional funds when we believe financial market conditions are favorable. Any equity financings could result in dilution to our then-existing security holders. Any debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that, among other things, restrict our ability to pay dividends and interest (although we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future). The required interest payments associated with any significant additional debt financing could materially adversely affect our ability to service our convertible subordinated notes and convertible senior subordinated notes. The terms of any additional debt financing may also, under certain circumstances, restrict or prohibit us from making interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs (including clinical trials), or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, drugs or drug candidates. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. IF WE FAIL TO EXPAND OUR HUMAN RESOURCES AND MANAGE OUR GROWTH EFFECTIVELY, OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER. We expect that if our clinical drug candidates continue to progress in development, we continue to build our commercial organization and our drug discovery efforts continue to generate drug candidates, we will require significant additional investment in personnel, management systems and resources. For example, the number of our full time employees increased by 17% in 2006, and we expect to experience significant growth in 2007. Our ability to commercialize our drug candidates, achieve our research and development objectives, and satisfy our commitments under our collaboration agreements depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands and expand our internal organization to accommodate additional anticipated growth. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, there could be a material adverse effect on our business. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. We have manufacturing, collaborative and clinical trial relationships, and we and our collaborators are seeking approval for our drug candidates, outside the United States. In addition, we expect that if telaprevir is approved for commercial sale, a significant portion of our commercial supply chain, including sourcing of raw materials and manufacturing, will be located in the Far East and European Union. Consequently, we are, and will continue to be, subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries. Risks associated with conducting operations in foreign countries include: · differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries; · unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; · economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; · compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or travelling abroad; 41    · foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes; · foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses or reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business or operating a subsidiary in another country; · workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; · production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and · business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism. These and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations. IF WE LOSE OUR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE. We believe that our integrated drug discovery capability gives us a technological advantage over our competitors. However, the pharmaceutical research field is characterized by rapid technological progress and intense competition. As a result, we may not realize the expected benefits from these technologies. For example, a large pharmaceutical company, with significantly more resources than we have, could pursue a systematic approach to the discovery of drugs based on gene families, using proprietary drug targets, compound libraries, novel chemical approaches, structural protein analysis and information technologies. Such a company might identify broadly applicable compound classes faster and more effectively than we do. Further, we believe that interest in the application of structure-based drug design, parallel drug design and related approaches has accelerated as the strategies have become more widely understood. Businesses, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are conducting research to develop technologies that may compete with those we use. It is possible that our competitors could acquire or develop technologies that would render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive. For example, a competitor could develop information technologies that accelerate the atomic-level analysis of potential compounds that bind to the active site of a drug target, and predict the absorption, toxicity, and relative ease-of-synthesis of candidate compounds. If we were unable to access the same technologies at an acceptable price, our business could be adversely affected. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF KEY EMPLOYEES OR THE FAILURE TO HIRE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND FUTURE GROWTH. Because our drug discovery and development activities are highly technical in nature, we require the services of highly qualified and trained scientists who have the skills necessary to conduct these activities. In addition, as we attempt to grow our capabilities with respect to clinical development, regulatory affairs, quality control and sales and marketing, we will need to attract and retain employees with experience in these fields. Our future success will depend in large part on the continued services of our key scientific and management personnel. We have entered into employment agreements with some individuals and provide compensation-related benefits to all of our key employees that vest over time and therefore induce them to remain with us. However, the employment agreements can be terminated by the employee on relatively short notice. The value to employees of stock-related benefits that vest over time—such as options and restricted stock—will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that we cannot control, and may at any point in time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. 42     We face intense competition for our personnel from our competitors, our collaborators and other companies throughout our industry. Moreover, the growth of local biotechnology companies and the expansion of major pharmaceutical companies into the Boston area have increased competition for the available pool of skilled employees, especially in technical fields, and the high cost of living in the Boston and San Diego areas makes it difficult to attract employees from other parts of the country. A failure to retain, as well as hire, train and effectively integrate into our organization a sufficient number of qualified scientists and professionals would negatively affect our business and our ability to grow our business. In addition, the level of funding under certain of our collaborative agreements depends on the number of our employees performing research and/or development under those agreements. If we cannot hire and retain the required personnel, funding received under the agreements may be reduced. IF OUR PATENTS DO NOT PROTECT OUR DRUGS, OR OUR DRUGS INFRINGE THIRD-PARTY PATENTS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES. We have numerous patent applications pending in the United States, as well as foreign counterparts in other countries. Our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain and maintain United States and foreign patent protection for our drugs, their uses and our processes, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We do not know whether any patents will issue from any of our patent applications or, even if patents issue or have issued, that the issued claims will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be valuable commercially. Legal standards relating to the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims in the pharmaceutical field are still evolving, and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims in biopharmaceutical patents or the effect of prior art on them. If we are not able to obtain adequate patent protection, our ability to prevent competitors from making, using and selling similar drugs will be limited. Furthermore, our activities may infringe the claims of patents held by third parties. Defense and prosecution of infringement or other intellectual property claims, as well as participation in other inter-party proceedings, can be expensive and time-consuming, regardless of whether or not the outcome is favorable to us. If the outcome of any such litigation or proceeding were adverse, we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties, could be required to obtain licenses from third parties or could be required to cease sales of affected drugs, any of which outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business. WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER LEXIVA/TELZIR WILL CONTINUE TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKET FOR HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS. We currently receive royalties from sales of Lexiva/Telzir under our collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. Lexiva/Telzir’s share of the worldwide protease inhibitor market may decrease due to competitive forces and market dynamics. Other HIV PIs including Bristol-Myers Squibbs’ Reyataz® and Abbott Laboratories’ Kaletra®, and a number of other products are on the market for the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. Other drugs are still in development by our competitors, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim and Johnson & Johnson, which may have better efficacy, fewer side effects, easier administration and/or lower costs than Lexiva/Telzir. Moreover, the growth in the worldwide market for HIV PIs has, to a certain extent, occurred as a result of early and aggressive treatment of HIV infection with a protease inhibitor-based regimen. Changes in treatment strategy, in which treatment is initiated later in the course of infection, or in which treatment is more often initiated with a regimen that does not include a protease inhibitor, may result in reduced use of HIV PIs. As a result, the total market for HIV PIs may decline, decreasing the sales potential of Lexiva/Telzir. Further, although we provide education efforts related to the promotion of Lexiva/Telzir in the United States and key markets in Europe, GlaxoSmithKline directs the majority of the marketing and sales efforts and the positioning of Lexiva/Telzir in the overall market, and we have little control over the direction or success of those efforts. GlaxoSmithKline has the right to terminate its agreement with us without cause upon twelve months’ notice, and would have no obligation to pay further royalties to us upon any such termination. 43    IF PHYSICIANS, PATIENTS AND THIRD-PARTY PAYORS DO NOT ACCEPT OUR FUTURE DRUGS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE, IF ANY. Even if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients and health care payors. Physicians may elect not to recommend our drugs for a variety of reasons including: · the timing of the market introduction of competitive drugs; · lower demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other drugs; · lack of cost-effectiveness; · lack of availability of reimbursement from third-party payors; · convenience and ease of administration; · prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; · other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and · ineffective marketing and distribution support. If our approved drugs fail to achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenue. IF THE GOVERNMENT AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PAYORS FAIL TO PROVIDE COVERAGE AND ADEQUATE PAYMENT RATES FOR OUR FUTURE DRUGS, OUR REVENUE AND PROSPECTS FOR PROFITABILITY WILL BE HARMED. In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of any future drugs will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Such third-party payors include government health programs such as Medicare, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they will cover and the amounts that they will pay for these drugs. As a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our future drugs. We might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future drugs to such payors’ satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Our future drugs might not ultimately be considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower-cost products that are already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other products or services, and may reflect budgetary constraints and/or imperfections in Medicare or Medicaid data used to calculate these rates. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government health care programs. In addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would permit more widespread importation of drugs from foreign countries into the United States, which may include importation from countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the United States. Such legislation, or similar regulatory changes or relaxation of laws that restrict imports of drugs from other countries, could reduce the net price we receive for our marketed drugs. 44    OUR BUSINESS HAS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF INSURANCE, A PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Our business exposes us to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, manufacturing and sales and marketing of human therapeutic products. We currently have clinical trial insurance and will seek to obtain product liability insurance prior to the sales and marketing of any of our drug candidates. However, our insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to maintain current amounts of insurance coverage or obtain additional or sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect against losses that could have a material adverse effect on us. If a claim is brought against us, we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as uncovered damages awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us. Furthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims, we might be required to direct significant financial and managerial resources to such defense, and adverse publicity is likely to result. IF WE DO NOT COMPLY WITH LAWS REGULATING THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SAFETY, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Our research and development efforts involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials. Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Due to the small amount of hazardous materials that we generate, we have determined that the cost to secure insurance coverage for environmental liability and toxic tort claims far exceeds the benefits. Accordingly, we do not maintain any insurance to cover pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of hazardous materials. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations. WE HAVE ADOPTED ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS THAT MAY FRUSTRATE ANY ATTEMPT TO REMOVE OR REPLACE OUR CURRENT MANAGEMENT. Our corporate charter and by-law provisions and stockholder rights plan may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of Vertex that might be beneficial to us or our security holders. Our charter provides for staggered terms for the members of the Board of Directors. Our by-laws grant the directors a right to adjourn annual meetings of stockholders, and certain provisions of the by-laws may be amended only with an 80% stockholder vote. Pursuant to our stockholder rights plan, each share of common stock has an associated preferred share purchase right. The rights will not trade separately from the common stock until, and are exercisable only upon, the acquisition or the potential acquisition through tender offer by a person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock. We may issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without stockholder approval and upon such terms as our Board of Directors may determine. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. As a result, stockholders or other parties may find it more difficult to remove or replace our current management. 45    OUR STOCK PRICE MAY FLUCTUATE BASED ON FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. Market prices for securities of companies such as Vertex are highly volatile. Within the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, our common stock traded between $26.50 and $45.38 per share. The market for our stock, like that of other companies in the biotechnology field, has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to our operating performance. The future market price of our securities could be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as: · announcements of results of clinical trials or nonclinical studies; · announcements of financial results and other operating performance measures, or capital structuring activities; · technological innovations or the introduction of new drugs by our competitors; · government regulatory action; · public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by others; · developments in patent or other intellectual property rights or announcements relating to these matters; · developments in domestic and international governmental policy or regulation, for example relating to intellectual property rights; and · developments relating specifically to other companies and market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in general. OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING OR REDUCE OUR FLEXIBILITY TO ACT IN OUR BEST INTERESTS. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $42.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due in September 2007 and approximately $59.6 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due in February 2011 outstanding. In February 2007, we announced that we will redeem the 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due in February 2011 on March 5, 2007 after which our outstanding indebtedness will be significantly reduced. Notwithstanding the redemption of our convertible senior subordinated notes in March 2007, the level of our indebtedness will affect us by: · exposing us to fixed rates of interest, which may be in excess of prevailing market rates; · making it more difficult to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; · constraining our ability to react quickly in an unfavorable economic climate or to changes in our business or the pharmaceutical industry; and · requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow to service of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes. OUR ESTIMATES OF OUR LIABILITY UNDER OUR KENDALL SQUARE LEASE MAY BE INACCURATE. We leased a 290,000 square foot facility in Kendall Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts in January 2003 for a 15-year term. We currently are occupying approximately 120,000 square feet of the facility. We have sublease arrangements in place for the remaining rentable square footage of the facility. In determining our obligations under the lease for the portion of the facility that we are not occupying, we have made certain assumptions relating to the time necessary to sublease the space after the expiration of the initial subleases, projected future sublease rental rates and the anticipated durations of future subleases. Our  46    estimates have changed in the past, and may change in the future, resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of liability, and the effect of any such adjustments could be material. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OR LITIGATION AGAINST OUR COLLABORATORS COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. The federal government, certain state governments and private payors are investigating and have begun to file actions against numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies alleging that the reporting of prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted in a false and overstated Average Wholesale Price, or AWP, which in turn is alleged to have improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by Medicare beneficiaries, insurers, state Medicaid programs, medical plans and others to health care providers who prescribed and administered those products. Some payors are also alleging that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are not reporting their “best price” to the states under the Medicaid program. In addition, recent government litigation against pharmaceutical companies has focused on allegations of off-label promotion in connection with the filing of false claims for government reimbursement. In any AWP cases or other cases brought by the government where our collaborators or licensees are named as defendants with respect to any products licensed from us, the outcome of the case could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. SALES OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, the issuance of common stock upon exercise of any outstanding option or the conversion of any of our outstanding convertible debt would be dilutive, and may cause the market price for a share of our common stock to decline. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 126.1 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. We also had outstanding options to purchase approximately 14.3 million shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $26.44 per share. Our outstanding notes were convertible into approximately 4.4 million shares of common stock with a weighted average conversion price of $22.87 per share. Outstanding options and convertible notes may be exercised or converted, as the case may be, if the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable exercise or conversion price.
