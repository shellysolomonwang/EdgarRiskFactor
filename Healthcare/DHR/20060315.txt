The Company disclaims any duty to update any forward-looking statement, all of which are expressly qualified by the foregoing.   PART I   ITEM 1. BUSINESS  General  Danaher Corporation derives its sales from the design, manufacture and marketing of industrial and consumer products, which are typically characterized by strong brand names, proprietary technology and major market positions, in three business segments: Professional Instrumentation, Industrial Technologies, and Tools & Components.  The Company strives to create shareholder value through:        •   delivering sales growth, excluding the impact of acquired businesses, in excess of the overall market growth for its products and services;        •   upper quartile financial performance when compared against peer companies; and        •   upper quartile cash flow generation from operations when compared against peer companies. To accomplish these goals, the Company uses a set of tools and processes, known as the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM (“DBS”), which are designed to continuously improve business performance in critical areas of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. The Company also acquires businesses that it believes can help it achieve the objectives described above. The Company will acquire businesses when they strategically fit with existing operations or when they are of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic line of business. The extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and integrated can affect the Company’s overall growth and operating results.  Danaher Corporation, originally DMG, Inc., was organized in 1969 as a Massachusetts real estate investment trust. In 1978 it was reorganized as a Florida corporation under the name Diversified Mortgage Investors, Inc. (“DMI”) which in a second reorganization in 1980 became a subsidiary of a newly created holding company named DMG, Inc. The Company adopted the name Danaher in 1984 and was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation following the 1986 annual meeting of shareholders.  Operating Segments  The Company reports its business in three segments: Professional Instrumentation, Industrial Technologies, and Tools & Components.  The table below describes the percentage of the Company’s total annual revenues attributable to each of the segments over each of the last three fiscal years:                  Segment   For the years ended December 31      2005     2004     2003     Professional Instrumentation   47 %   43 %   37 %   Industrial Technologies   37 %   38 %   40 %   Tools & Components   16 %   19 %   23 %    3    Table of Contents Sales in 2005 by geographic destination were: United States, 53%; Europe, 29%; Asia, 12%; and other regions, 6%.

The following discussions of Raw Materials, Intellectual Property, Competition, Seasonal Nature of Business, Backlog, Employee Relations, Research and Development, Government Contracts, Regulatory Matters, International Operations, Major Customers and Other Matters include information common to all of the Company’s segments.    7    Table of Contents Raw Materials  The Company’s manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, copper, cast iron, electronic components, aluminum, plastics and other petroleum-based products. The Company purchases raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world. There have been no raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, although market forces during the past two years have caused significant increases in the costs of certain raw materials such as steel and petroleum-based products. While certain raw materials such as steel and certain petroleum-based products remain subject to supply constraints, Danaher believes that it will generally be able to obtain adequate supplies of major raw material requirements or reasonable substitutes at reasonable costs.  Intellectual Property  The Company owns numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Although in aggregate the Company’s intellectual property is important to its operations, the Company does not consider any single patent or trademark to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole. From time to time, however, the Company does engage in litigation to protect its intellectual property. For a discussion of risks related to the Company’s intellectual property, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” All capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, the Company or its subsidiaries.  Competition  Although the Company’s businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets, its competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since its competitors do not offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as the Company. Because of the diversity of products sold and the variety of markets served, the Company encounters a wide variety of competitors, including well-established regional or specialized competitors, as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies that have greater sales, marketing, research, and financial resources than Danaher. The number of competitors varies by product line. Management believes that Danaher has a market leadership position in many of the markets served. Key competitive factors typically include price, quality, delivery speed, service and support, innovation, product features and performance, knowledge of applications, distribution network, and brand name.  Seasonal Nature of Business  General economic conditions have an impact on the Company’s business and financial results, and certain of the Company’s businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end-markets that they serve. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months, capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter, sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products, and sales to the United States government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter. However, as a whole, the Company is not subject to material seasonality.  Backlog  Backlog is generally not considered a significant factor in the Company’s businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of its products.   Employee Relations  At December 31, 2005, the Company employed approximately 40,000 persons, of which approximately 18,000 were employed in the United States. Of these United States employees, approximately 1,500 were hourly-rated unionized employees. The Company also has government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements or union contracts in other countries. Though the Company considers its labor relations to be good, it is subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes.  Research and Development  The table below describes the Company’s research and development expenditures over each of the last three fiscal years, by segment and in the aggregate:                     For the years ended December 31($ in millions)   Segment   2005   2004   2003   Professional Instrumentation   $ 232   $ 173   $ 107   Industrial Technologies     135     112     90   Tools & Components     12     9     10                       Total   $ 379   $ 294   $ 207                        8    Table of Contents The Company conducts research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products and services and improving existing products and services. In particular, the Company emphasizes the development of new products that are compatible with, and build upon, its manufacturing and marketing capabilities.  Government Contracts  The Company has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities, primarily involving products in the aerospace and defense, product identification, water quality and motion businesses. As a result, the Company is subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. The Company’s agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. The Company is also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs. A failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts, criminal or civil sanctions, administrative penalties or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.  Regulatory Matters  Environmental, Health & Safety  Certain of the Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the United States and abroad in connection with its operations. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and, based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. For a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”  In addition to environmental compliance costs, the Company may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. For example, generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist, as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons, are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority. The Company has received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and from state and non-U.S. environmental agencies, that conditions at a number of sites where the Company and others disposed of hazardous wastes require clean-up and other possible remedial action, including sites where the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations. The Company has projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities, in both the United States and abroad, to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. In particular, Joslyn Manufacturing Company (“JMC”), a subsidiary of the Company acquired in September 1995 and the assets of which were divested in November 2004, previously operated wood treating facilities that chemically preserved utility poles, pilings, railroad ties and wood flooring blocks. These facilities used wood preservatives that included creosote, pentachlorophenol and chromium-arsenic-copper. All such treating operations were discontinued or sold prior to 1982. While preservatives were handled in accordance with then existing law, environmental law now imposes retroactive liability, in some circumstances, on persons who owned or operated wood-treating sites. JMC is remediating some of its former sites and expects to remediate other sites in the future. In connection with the divestiture of the assets of JMC, JMC retained the environmental liabilities described above and agreed to indemnify the buyer of the assets with respect to certain environmental-related liabilities. The Company is also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances.    9    Table of Contents The Company has made a provision for environmental remediation and environmental-related personal injury claims. The Company generally makes an assessment of the costs involved for its remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as its prior experience with similar sites. If the Company determines that it has potential remediation liability for properties currently owned or previously sold, it accrues the total estimated costs, including investigation and remediation costs, associated with the site. The Company also estimates its exposure for environmental-related personal injury claims and accrues for this estimated liability as such claims become known. While the Company actively pursues appropriate insurance recoveries as well as appropriate recoveries from other potentially responsible parties, it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of the Company’s involvement in certain sites, uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the availability of alternative cleanup methods, variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company’s estimates of environmental liabilities will not change. In view of the Company’s financial position and reserves for environmental matters and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, the Company believes that its liability, if any, related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or cash flow. For a discussion of risks related to past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”  Medical Devices  Certain of the Company’s products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and by the counterpart agencies of the non-U.S. countries where its products are sold. Some of the regulatory requirements of these foreign countries are different than those applicable in the United States. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable medical device regulations.  Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), the FDA regulates virtually all phases of the manufacture, sale, and distribution of medical devices, including their introduction into interstate commerce, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution and record keeping. Pursuant to the FDCA and FDA regulations, certain facilities of the Company’s operating subsidiaries are registered with the FDA as medical device manufacturing establishments. The FDA and the Company’s ISO Notified Bodies regularly inspect the Company’s registered and/or certified facilities.  Products sold by the Company include Class I, Class II, and Class III medical devices. A medical device, whether exempt from, or cleared pursuant to, the premarket notification requirements of the FDCA, or cleared pursuant to a premarket approval application, is subject to ongoing regulatory oversight by the FDA to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, product labeling requirements and limitations, including those related to promotion and marketing efforts, current good manufacturing practices and quality system requirements, record keeping, and medical device (adverse event) reporting. For a discussion of risks related to the regulation of the Company by the FDA and counterpart agencies of other countries, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”  In addition, certain of the Company’s products utilize radioactive material. The Company is subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the management, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and believes that it is in substantial compliance with these regulations.  Export Compliance  The Company is required to comply with various export control and economic sanctions laws, including: the International Traffic in Arms Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which, among other things, imposes license requirements on the export from the United States of defense articles and defense services (i.e., items specifically designed or adapted for a military application and/or listed on the United States Munitions List); the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, which, among other things, impose licensing requirements on the export or re-export of certain dual-use goods, technology and software (i.e., items that potentially have both commercial and military applications); and the regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implement economic sanctions imposed against designated countries, governments and persons based on United States foreign policy and national security considerations. Non-United States governments have also implemented similar export control regulations, which may affect Company operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions, including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic/business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.  We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may face decreased demand or price reductions for our products.  Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive. Because of the diversity of products sold and the variety of markets served, we encounter a wide variety of competitors. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers, establish relationships with new customers, continually develop new products and services designed to maintain our leadership position in various product categories and penetrate new markets. Our failure to compete effectively may reduce our revenues, profitability and cash flow, and pricing pressures may adversely impact our profitability.  Technologies, product offerings and customer requirements in many of our markets change rapidly. If we fail to keep up with these changes, we may not be able to meet our customers’ needs and demand for our products may decline.  Rapid technological change and frequent introductions of new products and services characterize many of the markets we serve. Changes in regulations can also impact demand for new products in our markets. Our failure to successfully embrace and respond to these changes and developments may reduce our revenues and cash flow and adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully embrace and respond to these changes and developments, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer.  Our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital. Conversely, any inability to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate could negatively impact our growth rate.  As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course, some of which may be material. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we acquired 13, 13 and 12 businesses, respectively. Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability:        •   Any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it.        •   Acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results.        •   Acquisitions could place unanticipated demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems.        •   We could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other systems.    12    Table of Contents     •   We may be unable to achieve cost savings anticipated in connection with the integration of an acquired business.        •   We may assume by acquisition unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, or internal control deficiencies. The realization of any of these liabilities may increase our expenses and reduce our cash reserves.  Conversely, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at similar rates to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate. Our ability to achieve our growth goals depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings. In addition, changes in accounting or regulatory requirements could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions.  The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.  Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of their company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position.  The resolution of contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We have retained responsibility for some of the known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold, such as lawsuits, product liability claims and environmental matters, and agreed to indemnify the purchasers of these businesses for certain known and unknown contingent liabilities. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition but we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.  Our success depends on our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and avoid claims of infringement or misuse of third party intellectual property.  We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our operations. The steps we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations. In addition, from time to time in the usual course of business, we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. In the event of a successful claim against us, we could lose our rights to needed technology or be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights, any of which could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and cash flows. Even where we are successful in defending claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs which could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.  We are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business, including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products, claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters and commercial disputes. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.  Our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities, costs, litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.  Certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the U.S. and abroad in connection with our operations. There can be no assurance that we have been or will be at all times in substantial compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.  In addition, we may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or    13    Table of Contents other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters.” There can be no assurance that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities.  Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.  In addition to the environmental regulations noted above, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels, including the following:        •   We are required to comply with various export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect Company transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between Company employees and Company subsidiaries. In certain circumstances these regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances the Company may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item.        •   Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by counterpart agencies of other countries and by regulations governing the management, storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials. Violations of these regulations, efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products could lead to declining sales, recalls, seizures, injunctions, administrative detentions, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, premarket notification rescissions, and warning letters.        •   We also have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. Our agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. A failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting.  In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation.  Our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.  We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial monetary and non-monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries, and could damage our reputation.  Cyclical economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Certain of our businesses operate in industries that have historically experienced periodic downturns, which have adversely impacted demand for the equipment and services that we manufacture and market. Any downturn or competitive pricing pressures in these industries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in any given period.  Foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Changes in currency exchange rates and commodity prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials, components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand, our business and financial results will suffer.  We purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, we may not be able to produce sufficient    14    Table of Contents quantities of product to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase. In addition, because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed our production requirements or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.  Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.  We have a number of domestic collective bargaining units and various foreign collective labor arrangements. While we generally have experienced satisfactory relations at our various locations, we are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.  International economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  In 2005, approximately 47% of our sales were derived outside the U.S. and we continue to increase our sales outside the U.S. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the U.S. Our international business is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in foreign operations and could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:        •   interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers;        •   changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions;        •   trade protection measures;        •   import or export licensing requirements;        •   unexpected changes in laws or licensing and regulatory requirements;        •   difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;        •   differing labor regulations;        •   differing protection of intellectual property; and        •   terrorist activities and the U.S. and international response thereto.  Audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.  The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities.  Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our operating results.  Our defined benefit pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates and the majority of plan assets are invested in publicly traded debt and equity securities, which are affected by market risks. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely impact our future operating results.   ITEM 1B.
