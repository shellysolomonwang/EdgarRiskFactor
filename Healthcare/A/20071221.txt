Item 1A. Risk Factors   Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results    Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.    Visibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. For example, if the Asia Pacific market does not grow as anticipated, our results could suffer. We experienced recent weakness in our Asia Pacific market, notably in Japan and particularly during the six months ended October 31, 2007. The broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business, and therefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such decline could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our gross margins.    The actions that we have taken in order to reduce costs could have long-term adverse effects on our business.    We have largely completed our program to transition our company to a reduced cost structure. These reductions and regular ongoing evaluations of our cost structure, could have the effect of reducing our talent pool and available resources and, consequently, could have long-term effects on our business by decreasing or slowing improvements in our products, affecting our ability to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could cause our income to be lower than it otherwise might be and, as a result, adversely affect our stock price.    If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.    We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:    •properly identify customer needs; •innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications; •successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; •manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time; •differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;   20          •price our products competitively; •anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and •control product quality in our manufacturing process.     Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.    As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we have been outsourcing aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology ("IT") function and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of the IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues, unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.    Failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.    Our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.    Our income may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.    Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an  21      upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income.    Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.    Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities are increasingly located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:    •interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; •changes in foreign currency exchange rates; •changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions; •trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; •negative consequences from changes in tax laws; •difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; •differing labor regulations; •differing protection of intellectual property; •unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and •geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.    We centralized most of our accounting processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts receivables functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results. In addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond that twelve month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure.    Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.    Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is also intense competition for certain highly  22      technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees.    The impact of consolidation of competitors in the test and measurement market is difficult to predict and may harm our business.    The test and measurement industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. For instance, in November 2007, Danaher Corporation, one of our competitors, completed the acquisition of Tektronix, Inc., another of our competitors. Consolidation in the test and measurement industry could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.    Our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.    In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. For example, in our fiscal year 2006, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business and spin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business, and this year we completed several acquisitions, including the acquisition of Stratagene Corporation in our third fiscal quarter. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. Such transactions often have post-closing arrangements including but not limited to post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. In addition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including:    •the retention of key employees; •the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas; •the retention of key customers; •the compatibility of our sales programs and facilities within those of the acquired company; and •the compatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company.    A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:    •effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser; •identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and •reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.    Future impairment of the value of purchased assets and goodwill could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results. And, our inability to timely and effectively apply our systems of  23       internal controls to an acquired business could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.   In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.    Environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.    Some of our properties are undergoing remediation by HP for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from HP. HP has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. HP will have access to our properties to perform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations. In addition, the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation.   We have agreed to indemnify HP for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from HP to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by HP. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination.   Our current and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to Avago and Verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the U.S., even if the sites outside the U.S. are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.    Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.    Our businesses are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to health and safety, packaging, product content, labor and import/export regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more  24      stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products.   Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.   Some of our chemical analysis products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the Toxic Substances Control Act. We must conform the manufacture, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be made to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.    We are subject to laws and regulations, and failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.    We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts, or administrative penalties.   A number of our products from our bio-analytical measurement business are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers, investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions, increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products.    Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.    While we do not believe that we infringe the valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of third parties, there may be potentially relevant third party intellectual property rights that we are unaware of. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property  25      litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services.   We often rely on licenses of third party intellectual property that is useful for our businesses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all. Our intellectual property portfolio, which we use in negotiating licenses and asserting counterclaims, continually changes as we review and adjust the patents and other intellectual property in the portfolio consistent with our business strategies. Accordingly, the amount of intellectual property that is available for us to use in our defense or for negotiations is continually changing and may decrease.    Third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.    Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.   Our pending patent applications, and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.   We may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allows them to compete with us using that intellectual property.    We have received a Revenue Agent's Report from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years 2000 through 2002 claiming a significant increase in our U.S. taxable income. An adverse outcome of this examination or any future examinations involving similar claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.    Our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2002 have been under audit by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). In August 2007, we received a Revenue Agent's Report ("RAR"). In the RAR, the IRS proposes to assess a net tax deficiency, after applying available net operating losses from the years under audit and undisputed tax credits, for those years of approximately $405 million, plus penalties of approximately $160 million and interest. If the IRS were to fully prevail, our net operating loss and tax credits generated in recent years would be utilized earlier than they otherwise would have been and our annual effective tax rate will have increased as a result. The RAR addresses several issues. One issue, however, relating to the use of Agilent's brand name by our foreign affiliates,  26      accounts for a majority of the claimed tax deficiency. We believe that the claimed IRS adjustment for this issue in particular is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that we have meritorious defenses to this claim. Therefore we have not included any tax for this item in our tax provision for 2007. We have filed a formal protest and requested a conference with the Appeals Office of the IRS and have opposed this claim, and most of the other claimed adjustments proposed in the RAR, vigorously. The final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and may take several years. Based on current information, it is our opinion that the ultimate disposition of these matters is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is in excess of the tax provisions we have recorded in connection with the proposed assessment, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.    We have restructured our World Trade financing arrangement, which has increased the cost to us of this arrangement and we may have to restructure this arrangement in the future, which may further increase the cost to us. We also may be subject to the risk that our current financing arrangements could be accelerated prior to their scheduled repayment date.    In January 2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade, Inc. ("World Trade"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation (together, the "Original Repurchase Agreement") with Fenway Capital, LLC (the "Counterparty") pursuant to which World Trade sold to the Counterparty, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion, 15,000 Class A Preferred Shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (the "Purchased Securities"), having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5 billion. Pursuant to the Original Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to repurchase the preferred shares for 100 percent of their aggregate liquidation preference in January 2011.   On September 10, 2007, World Trade entered into an amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement (the "Amended Repurchase Agreement") and certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Ebbets Funding PLC as the Counterparty at the request of Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation ("Merrill Lynch"). On November 16, 2007, World Trade entered into a further amendment to the Amended Repurchase Agreement (such Amended Repurchase Agreement as amended, the "Repurchase Agreement") and certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Belmont Funding LLC as the Counterparty at the request of Merrill Lynch. On December 7, 2007, Agilent and World Trade entered into a further amendment to the Repurchase Agreement among Agilent, Merrill and World Trade (the "Related Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Repurchase Agreement and Related Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make quarterly payments to the Counterparty at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the cost of funds to the Counterparty plus 20 basis points, or (ii) three-month LIBOR plus 52 basis points   As provided in Related Agreement, at any time after February 5, 2008, Merrill Lynch may require that World Trade accelerate the date of repurchase of all or any portion of the Purchased Securities to a date designated by Merrill Lynch that is no earlier than 120 days from the date that Merrill Lynch provides notice. Agilent may restructure the terms of this transaction or may pursue a new transaction to replace this transaction. There can be no assurances as to the timing or terms of any such restructuring or new transaction, and any such restructuring or new transaction may result in an increase in the cost of this transaction to Agilent.  27         We have issued $600 million in a debt offering and entered into a credit facility and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.    In October 2007, we issued $600 million in senior unsecured notes. In addition, in May 2007, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to $300 million. Although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility, we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock or expansion of our business.   Our incurrence of this debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:    •increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions; •requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and •limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.    Our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, our long-term non-convertible debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants under our long-term debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.    We have substantial cash requirements in the United States while a majority of our cash is generated outside of the United States. The failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the United States could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.    Although cash generated in the United States covers normal operating requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as repurchases of our stock, acquisitions of third parties, and the refinancing at maturity of our $1.5 billion obligation related to our World Trade financing arrangement. Our business operating results, financial condition, and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through (1) the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or (2) other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost.    If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.    Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent Technologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Washington and Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. In addition, since  28      we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism.    If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which could harm our brands and operating results.    Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We have devoted significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, Section 404 under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we assess and our auditors attest to the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting. Our compliance with the annual internal control report requirement for each fiscal year will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting and data systems and controls across our operating subsidiaries. Furthermore, an important part of our growth strategy has been, and will likely continue to be, the acquisition of complementary businesses, and we expect these systems and controls to become increasingly complex to the extent that we integrate acquisitions and our business grows. Likewise, the complexity of our systems and controls may become more difficult to manage as we transform our operating structure and continue to reduce infrastructure costs. To effectively manage these changes, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in light of likely future acquisitions of companies that are not in compliance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, difficulties encountered in their implementation or operation, or difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause it to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.
