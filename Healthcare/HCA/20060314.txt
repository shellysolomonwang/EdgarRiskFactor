Item 1A.  Risk Factors    Risk Factors   If any of the events discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, HCA’s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also constrain its business and operations. In either case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and stockholders could lose all or part of their investment.           Our Hospitals Face Competition For Patients From Other Hospitals And Health Care Providers.    The health care business is highly competitive and competition among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the local communities served by most of our hospitals provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals. In 2005, CMS began making public performance data related to ten quality measures that hospitals submit in connection with their Medicare reimbursement. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on these ten quality measures, patient volumes could decline. In the future, other trends toward clinical transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volumes. In addition, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment. Some of the hospitals that compete with our hospitals are owned by governmental agencies or not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis. We are facing increasing competition from physician-owned specialty hospitals and freestanding surgery centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel. If our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, we may experience a decline in patient volume. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.”  22   Table of Contents  Section 507 of MMA provided for an 18-month moratorium on the establishment of new specialty hospitals. Congress also required that MedPAC and HHS conduct studies on specialty hospitals with reports to be completed no later than 15 months after the date of enactment of MMA. The moratorium expired on June 8, 2005. In March 2005, MedPAC issued its report on specialty hospitals, in which it recommended that Congress extend the moratorium until January 1, 2007, modify payments to hospitals to reflect more closely the cost of care, and allow certain types of gainsharing arrangements. In May 2005, HHS issued the required report of its analysis of specialty hospitals in which it recommended reforming certain inpatient hospital services and ambulatory surgery center services payment rates that may currently encourage the establishment of specialty hospitals and implementation of closer scrutiny of the processes for approving new specialty hospitals for participation in Medicare. Further, HHS suspended processing new provider enrollment applications for specialty hospitals until January 2006, creating in effect a moratorium on new specialty hospitals. DEFRA 2005 directed HHS to extend this enrollment suspension until the earlier of six months from the enactment of DEFRA 2005 or the release of a report regarding physician owned specialty hospitals by HHS. We cannot predict whether the moratorium will be extended beyond this date. If the moratorium expires, we may face additional competition from an increased number of specialty hospitals, including hospitals owned by physicians currently on staff at our hospitals.           The Growth Of Uninsured And Patient Due Accounts And A Deterioration In The Collectibility Of These Accounts Could Adversely Affect Our Results Of Operations.    The primary collection risks of our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly from patients.   On December 29, 2004, CMS issued guidance that has enabled hospitals to provide discounts to any uninsured patient without placing the hospital’s Medicare payments at risk. Based on this guidance, in 2005 we implemented modifications to our self-pay policies, the effect of which was to provide a discount to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are similar to those provided to many local managed care plans. In implementing the discount policy, hospitals first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.   The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal and state governmental and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. At December 31, 2005, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 85% of the $3.404 billion patient due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for which eligibility for Medicaid coverage was being evaluated (“pending Medicaid accounts”). For the year ended December 31, 2005, the provision for doubtful accounts decreased to 9.6% of revenues compared to 11.4% of revenues in 2004. Adjusting for the effect of the uninsured discount policy implemented January 1, 2005, the provision for doubtful accounts was 12.4% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005.   A continuation of the trends that have resulted in an increasing proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured accounts and a deterioration in the collectibility of these accounts will adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.           Changes In Governmental Programs May Reduce Our Revenues.    A significant portion of our patient volumes is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. We derived approximately 53% of our admissions from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2005. In recent years, legislative changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under these government programs.  23   Table of Contents  Congress has directed MedPAC to make recommendations regarding the levels of payments to health care providers under the Medicare program. For inpatient services for fiscal year 2007, MedPAC has recommended that Congress update inpatient PPS payments by the market basket minus 0.45 percentage points. For outpatient services for calendar year 2007, MedPAC has recommended that Congress update outpatient PPS payments by the market basket minus 0.45 percentage points. It is uncertain whether Congress will adopt these recommendations. If Congress adopts these recommendations, HCA’s revenues may be reduced. Other Medicare payment changes may also reduce HCA’s revenues. See Item 1, “Business — Sources of Revenue.”   A number of states are experiencing budget problems and have adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. DEFRA 2005, signed into law on February 8, 2006, includes Medicaid cuts of approximately $4.8 billion over five years. In addition, proposed regulatory changes, if implemented, would reduce federal Medicaid funding by an additional $12.2 billion over five years. States have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage and program eligibility, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. Hospital operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure because of deterioration in pricing flexibility and payer mix, and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in PPS payments under the Medicare program. Future legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of government health programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.           Demands Of Nongovernment Payers May Adversely Affect Our Growth In Revenues.    Our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with nongovernment payers, including managed care plans, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of most of our hospitals. Admissions derived from managed care and other insurers accounted for approximately 42% of our admissions in 2005. Nongovernment payers, including managed care payers, increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures. Reductions in price increases or the amounts received from managed care, commercial insurance or other payers could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.           Our Performance Depends On Our Ability To Recruit And Retain Quality Physicians.    Physicians generally direct the majority of hospital admissions and, therefore, the success of our hospitals depend, in part, on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and maintaining good relations with those physicians. Physicians are generally not employees of the hospitals at which they practice and, in many of the markets that HCA serves, most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. Such physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. If we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline.           If We Fail To Comply With Extensive Laws And Government Regulations, We Could Suffer Penalties Or Be Required To Make Significant Changes To Our Operations.    The health care industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:            •   billing for services;         •   relationships with physicians and other referral sources;         •   adequacy of medical care;         •   quality of medical equipment and services;         •   qualifications of medical and support personnel;   24   Table of Contents           •   confidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with health-related information and medical records;         •   the screening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who have emergency medical conditions;         •   licensure;         •   hospital rate or budget review;         •   operating policies and procedures; and         •   addition of facilities and services.    Among these laws are the Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark Law. These laws impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our hospitals, including employment contracts, leases and professional service agreements. We also provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into the communities served by our hospitals. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources, do not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-kickback Statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. We cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute.   Our financial relationships with physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-kickback Statute, failure to meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature.   If we fail to comply with the Anti-kickback Statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”   Because many of these laws and their implementation regulations are relatively new, we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality, or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, we are unable to predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or their impact.           Our Hospitals Face Competition For Staffing, Which May Increase Labor Costs And Reduce Profitability.    Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our physicians. We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has become a significant operating issue to health care providers. This shortage may require us to continue to enhance  25   Table of Contents  wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel. We also depend on the available labor pool of semiskilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. In addition, to the extent that a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, or attempts to unionize, our labor costs could increase. If our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. Because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is constrained. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations.           We Have Been The Subject Of Governmental Investigations, Claims And Litigation That Have Resulted In Significant Charges And Ongoing Reporting Obligations.    Commencing in 1997, HCA became aware that we were the subject of governmental investigations and litigation relating to our business practices. The investigations were concluded through a series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003. In January 2001, we entered into an eight-year CIA with the OIG. If we were found to be in violation of the CIA, we could be subject to substantial monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties and/or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such sanctions or expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.   In September 2005, we received a subpoena from the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York seeking the production of documents. Also in September 2005, we were informed that the SEC had issued a formal order of investigation. Both the subpoena and the formal order of investigation relate to trading in our securities. We are cooperating fully with these investigations.   Subsequently, HCA and certain of our executive officers and directors were named in various federal securities law class actions and several shareholders have filed derivative lawsuits purportedly on behalf of the Company. Additionally, a former employee of HCA filed a complaint against certain of our executive officers pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and we have been served with a shareholder demand letter addressed to our Board of Directors. We cannot predict the results of the investigations or any related lawsuits or the effect that findings in such investigations or lawsuits adverse to us may have on us. These proceedings are described in greater detail in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”            Controls Designed To Reduce Inpatient Services May Reduce Our Revenues.    Controls imposed by third-party payers designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as “utilization review,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payer-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. Although we are unable to predict the effect these changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.           Our Operations Could Be Impaired By A Failure Of Our Information Systems.    The performance of our sophisticated information technology and systems is critical to our business operations. In addition to our shared services initiatives, our information systems are essential to a number of critical areas of our operations, including:            •   accounting and financial reporting;         •   billing and collecting accounts;         •   coding and compliance;         •   clinical systems;   26   Table of Contents           •   medical records and document storage;         •   inventory management; and         •   negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts and supply contracts.    We are in the process of implementing projects to replace our payroll and human resources information systems. Management estimates that the payroll and human resources system projects will require total expenditures of approximately $332 million to develop and install. At December 31, 2005, project-to-date costs incurred were $278 million ($158 million of the costs incurred have been capitalized and $120 million have been expensed). Management expects that the system development, testing, data conversion and installation will continue through 2006. There can be no assurance that the development and implementation of those systems will not be delayed, that the total cost will not be significantly more than currently anticipated, that business processes will not be interrupted during implementation or that we will realize the expected benefits and efficiencies from the developed products.   Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or availability of our systems could adversely affect operations or delay the collection of revenue. Even though we have implemented network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, or cessations in the availability of systems, all of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.           State Efforts To Regulate The Construction Or Expansion Of Hospitals Could Impair Our Ability To Operate And Expand Our Operations.    Some states require health care providers to obtain prior approval, known as a certificate of need, or CON, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make changes in services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. We currently operate hospitals in a number of states with CON laws. The failure to obtain any requested CON could impair our ability to operate or expand operations.           Our Facilities Are Heavily Concentrated In Florida And Texas, Which Makes Us Sensitive To Regulatory, Economic, Environmental And Competitive Changes In Those States.    HCA operated 182 hospitals at December 31, 2005, and 74 of those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. This situation makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in those states.   Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.   In addition, both Florida and Texas are located in hurricane-prone areas. In the recent past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in Florida, Texas, and other coastal states, and the patient populations in those states. Our business activities could be harmed by a particularly active hurricane season or even a single storm.           We May Be Subject To Liabilities From Claims By The IRS.    HCA is currently contesting claims for income taxes, interest and penalties proposed by the IRS for prior years aggregating approximately $776 million through December 31, 2005. The disputed items include the deductibility of a portion of the 2001 government settlement payment, the timing of recognition of certain patient service revenues in 2000 through 2002, the method for calculating the tax allowance for uncollectible accounts in 2002, and the amount of insurance expense deducted in 1999 through 2002.   During February 2006, the IRS began an examination of our 2003 through 2004 federal income tax returns. The IRS has not determined the amount of any additional income tax, interest and penalties that it  27   Table of Contents  may claim upon completion of this examination or any future examinations that may be initiated. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — IRS Disputes.”           We May Be Subject To Liabilities From Claims Brought Against Our Facilities.    HCA is subject to litigation relating to our business practices, including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.” Many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs. We insure a substantial portion of our professional liability risks through a wholly-owned subsidiary. Management believes our insurance coverage is sufficient to cover claims arising out of the operation of our facilities. HCA’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance contracts, and the obligations covered by the reinsurance contracts are included in its reserves for professional liability risks, as the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. If payments for claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, are not covered by insurance or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.           We Are Exposed to Market Risks Related to Changes in the Market Values of Securities and Interest Rate Changes    HCA is exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investments in debt and equity securities of our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were $1.419 billion and $965 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. The fair value of investments is generally based on quoted market prices. If the insurance subsidiary were to experience significant declines in the fair value of its investments, this could require additional investment by us to allow the insurance subsidiary to satisfy its minimum capital requirements. At December 31, 2005, we had a net unrealized gain of $184 million on the insurance subsidiary’s investment securities.   We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The notional amounts and interest payments in these agreements match the cash flows of the related liabilities. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not assets or liabilities of HCA. Any market risk or opportunity associated with these swap agreements is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt. Our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Market Risk”.           Fluctuations In Operating Results And Other Factors May Result In Decreases In Our Stock Price.    There is significant volatility in the market price of HCA’s common stock. If we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past, investors could sell shares of HCA’s common stock when it becomes apparent that the expectations of the market may not be realized, resulting in a decrease in the market price of HCA’s common stock.   In addition to our operating results, the operating results of other hospital companies, changes in financial estimates or recommendations by analysts, changes in government health care programs, governmental investigations and litigation, speculation in the press or investment community, the possible effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities, adverse weather conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, or other developments affecting the health care industry, could cause substantial fluctuations in the market price of our common stock.  28   Table of Contents          We Have Increased Leverage As A Result Of Financing Our Recently Completed “Dutch” Auction Tender Offer.    In October 2005, we commenced a modified “Dutch” auction tender offer to purchase up to $2.5 billion of our common stock. To finance the tender offer, we used approximately $600 million of cash on hand and borrowed $800 million under a $1.0 billion short term loan facility. In connection with the tender offer, we amended our existing revolving credit facility and the related senior term loan to modify the compliance levels for our required ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization. Our total long-term debt, including amounts due within one year, was $10.475 billion at December 31, 2005. In February 2006, we issued $1.0 billion of 6.5% notes due in February 2016. The proceeds from the notes and the proceeds from the sales of hospitals were used to repay amounts under the $800 million term loan and to pay down amounts advanced under the existing revolving credit facility. The authorization permits us to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to the remainder of the $2.5 billion authorization from time to time through open market purchases, or in private or other transactions. During 2005, we repurchased 8.0 million shares of our common stock for $412 million through open market purchases. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “— Market Risk” and Note 8 — Long-Term Debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our debt obligations.   We may continue to make borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility, and we have issued debt securities, from time to time, including $1.0 billion of 6.5% Notes due 2016 issued in February 2006. We may issue additional debt securities in the future. Our ability to make payments on our debt and fund planned capital expenditures and the operation of our business will depend on cash flow from operations, amounts available under our existing revolving credit facility and our access to public and private debt markets. Our increased debt service obligations could, among other things:            •   limit our ability to borrow money or raise capital to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service, or for other purposes;         •   increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;         •   limit our ability to pay dividends and to obtain additional financing and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry; and         •   require the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities to the payment of principal and interest on our debt.   29   Table of Contents            Item 1B.
