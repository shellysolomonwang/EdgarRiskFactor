Item 1A. Risk Factors  If any of the events discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also constrain our business and operations.  Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations.  We are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was $30.488 billion. As of December 31, 2015, we had availability of $1.959 billion under our senior secured revolving credit facility and $220 million under our asset-based revolving credit facility, after giving effect to letters of credit and borrowing base limitations. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:        •    increasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in general economic, industry or competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations;        •    requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;        •    exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our unhedged borrowings are at variable rates of interest;        •    limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures;    33    Table of Contents     •    limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, product or service line development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and        •    limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.  We and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.  We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.  Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.  In addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.  We may find it necessary or prudent to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, the terms of which may not be favorable to us. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected by the then current global economic and financial conditions. In addition, our ability to incur secured indebtedness (which would generally enable us to achieve better pricing than the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness) depends in part on the value of our assets, which depends, in turn, on the strength of our cash flows and results of operations, and on economic and market conditions and other factors.  If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.  Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.  Our senior secured credit facilities and, to a lesser extent, the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:        •    incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;        •    pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;    34    Table of Contents     •    make certain investments;        •    sell or transfer assets;        •    create liens;        •    consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and        •    enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.  Under our asset-based revolving credit facility, when (and for as long as) the combined availability under our asset-based revolving credit facility and our senior secured revolving credit facility is less than a specified amount for a certain period of time or, if a payment or bankruptcy event of default has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into any of our depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and to collateralize letters of credit issued thereunder.  Under our senior secured credit facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance we will continue to meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under both the cash flow credit facility and the asset-based revolving credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under these senior secured credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, which would also result in an event of default under a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets under our senior secured credit facilities and that collateral is also pledged as collateral under our first lien notes. If any of the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance there will be sufficient assets to repay the senior secured credit facilities, the first lien notes and our other indebtedness.  Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.  The health care business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals. In addition, CMS publicizes on its Hospital Compare website performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys hospitals submit in connection with their Medicare reimbursement. Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. Additional quality measures and future trends toward clinical transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volumes. Further, every hospital must establish and update annually a public listing of the hospital’s standard charges for items and services. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on these quality measures or on patient satisfaction surveys or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, our patient volumes could decline.  In addition, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment. Some of the facilities that compete with our hospitals are physician-owned or are owned by governmental agencies or not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis. Our hospitals face competition from competitors that are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models. Our hospitals compete with specialty hospitals and with both our own and unaffiliated freestanding surgery centers for market share in certain high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel. If ASCs are better able to compete in this environment    35    Table of Contents  than our hospitals, our hospitals may experience a decline in patient volume, and we may experience a decrease in margin, even if those patients use our ASCs. In states that do not require a CON or other type of approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities or services, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. Further, if our competitors are better able to attract patients, make capital expenditures and maintain modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities than our hospitals and ASCs, we may experience an overall decline in patient volume. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.”  A deterioration in the collectability of uninsured and patient due accounts could adversely affect our results of operations.  The primary collection risks of our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (exclusions, deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Medicare reimburses hospitals for 65% of eligible Medicare bad debts. To be eligible for reimbursement, the amounts claimed must meet certain criteria, including that the debt is related to unpaid deductible or coinsurance amounts and that the hospital first attempted to collect the fees from the Medicare beneficiary.  The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of historical write-offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal and state governmental and private employer health care coverage, the rate of growth in uninsured patient admissions and other collection indicators. At December 31, 2015, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 94.5% of the $5.636 billion patient due accounts receivable balance. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care increased from $15.565 billion for 2013 to $15.943 billion for 2014 and to $18.287 billion for 2015.  Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of uninsured accounts receivable will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Our facilities may experience growth in bad debts, uninsured discounts and charity care as a result of a number of factors, including conditions impacting the overall economy and high unemployment. The Health Reform Law contains provisions that seek to decrease, over time, the number of uninsured individuals through reforms, most of which became effective January 1, 2014, but it is difficult to predict the full impact of the Health Reform Law. For example, a number of states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion. Further, certain provisions have been delayed. For example, the employer mandate, which requires firms with 50 or more full-time employees to offer health insurance or pay fines, was not fully implemented until January 1, 2016. Even after full implementation of the Health Reform Law, we may continue to experience bad debts and have to provide uninsured discounts and charity care for individuals residing in states that choose not to implement the Medicaid expansion, for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in an Exchange or government health care programs and for certain others who may not have insurance coverage. Further, implementation of the Health Reform Law could result in some patients terminating their current insurance plans in favor of lower cost Medicaid plans or other insurance coverage with lower reimbursement levels. We may also be adversely affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts as a result of increases in the adoption of plan structures that shift greater responsibility for care to individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and deductible amounts.  Changes in government health care programs may adversely affect our revenues.  A significant portion of our patient volume is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid. Specifically, we derived 42.1% of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2015. Changes in government health care programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.    36    Table of Contents In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under the Medicare program. The BCA requires automatic spending reductions of $1.2 trillion for federal fiscal years 2013 through 2021, minus any deficit reductions enacted by Congress and debt service costs. However, the percentage reduction for Medicare may not be more than 2% for a fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. These reductions have been extended by Congress through 2025. We are unable to predict what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress or whether Congress will attempt to suspend or restructure the automatic budget cuts. These reductions are in addition to reductions mandated by the Health Reform Law, which provides for material reductions in the growth of Medicare program spending, including reductions in Medicare market basket updates and Medicare DSH funding. Further, from time to time, CMS revises the reimbursement systems used to reimburse health care providers, including changes to the MS-DRG system and other payment systems, which may result in reduced Medicare payments. For example, CMS has established what is referred to as the “two midnight rule.” Under the rule, for admissions on or after October 1, 2013, services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are only payable as inpatient hospital services when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically necessary and will be required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances. Stays expected to need fewer than two midnights of hospital care will be subject to medical review on a case-by-case basis. QIOs are handling the reviews of short inpatient stays, and enforcement through RAC audits potentially will begin in 2016.  Because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often a state’s largest program, some states have enacted or may consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Further, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. The economic downturn increased the budgetary pressures on many states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted, and likely may continue to result, in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs and CHIP in many states. Some states that provide Medicaid supplemental payments are reviewing these programs or have filed waiver requests with CMS to replace these programs, and CMS has performed and continues to perform compliance reviews of some states’ programs, which could result in Medicaid supplemental payments being reduced or eliminated. Currently, Texas operates a Medicaid Waiver Program pursuant to a waiver that expires on September 30, 2016. Texas has submitted an application to extend its Waiver Program, but CMS has not yet issued a decision. We cannot predict whether the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program will be extended, continue in its current form or guarantee that revenues recognized from the program will not decrease.  The Health Reform Law made changes to the Medicaid program and will likely cause additional changes in the future. For example, the Health Reform Law provides for material reductions to Medicaid DSH funding. The Health Reform Law may require further state legislative and regulatory changes in order for states to comply with federal mandates and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities. A number of states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion provisions of the Health Reform Law, but these states could choose to implement the expansion at a later date. It is unclear how many states will ultimately implement the Medicaid expansion provisions of the law.  In some cases, commercial third-party payers rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from commercial third-party payers.  Current or future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts, changes in laws or regulations regarding government health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care programs and changes by commercial third-party payers in response to health care reform and other changes to government health care programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.    37    Table of Contents We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Health Reform Law, which represents a significant change to the health care industry.  The Health Reform Law changes how health care services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed through expanded coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments and the establishment and expansion of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. In addition, the law reforms certain aspects of health insurance, contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement and establishes ACOs and bundled payment pilot programs.  The expansion of health insurance coverage under the Health Reform Law may result in an increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage, and our facilities may benefit from Health Reform Law initiatives that create possible sources of additional revenue. However, any positive effects of the Health Reform Law could be offset and the Company could be significantly impacted by reductions to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Although the Health Reform Law has had a net positive effect on the Company to date, before considering the impact of Medicare reductions that began in 2010, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing net effect of the Health Reform Law on the Company because the resolution of a number of material factors remains unclear, including the following:        •    how many states will ultimately implement the Medicaid expansion provisions and under what terms;        •    the potential for and impact of further delays in or complications related to implementation of the Health Reform Law (for example, there were significant problems during the initial implementation of the Exchanges that negatively impacted the ability of individuals to purchase health insurance);        •    the possibility of enactment of additional federal or state health care reforms and possible changes to the Health Reform Law;        •    the success and long-term viability of the Exchanges, which may be impacted by whether a sufficient number of payers participate in the Exchanges;        •    our ability to participate in health insurance plans offered through the Exchanges and the terms of our participation as well as treatment of out of network claims;        •    how many previously uninsured individuals will obtain coverage as a result of the Health Reform Law;        •    what percentage of the newly insured patients will be covered under the Medicaid program and what percentage will be covered by private health insurers;        •    the extent to which states will enroll new Medicaid participants in managed care programs;        •    the pace at which insurance coverage expands, including the pace of different types of coverage expansion;        •    the change, if any, in the volume of inpatient and outpatient hospital services that are sought by and provided to previously uninsured individuals;        •    the rate paid to hospitals by private payers for newly covered individuals and individuals with existing coverage including those covered through health insurance plans offered through the Exchanges, some of whom may have been previously covered by employer-sponsored plans;        •    the rate paid by state governments and private payers pursuant to contracts with the state under the Medicaid program for newly covered individuals;        •    the effect of the value-based purchasing provisions of the Health Reform Law on our hospitals’ revenues and the effects of other quality programs;        •    the percentage of individuals in the Exchanges who select restricted network plans, since health insurers offering those kinds of products have traditionally sought to pay lower rates to hospitals;        •    the amount of overall revenues the Company will generate from Medicare and Medicaid business when the reductions are implemented (42.1% of our revenues in 2015 were from Medicare and Medicaid);    38    Table of Contents     •    the size of the Health Reform Law’s annual productivity adjustment to the market basket;        •    the implementation and amounts of Medicare DSH reductions and the allocation of the Medicaid DSH reductions to our hospitals;        •    the effect of ACO efforts to coordinate care and reduce costs, including the possibility that they will decrease reimbursement;        •    the scope and nature of potential changes to Medicare reimbursement methods, such as an emphasis on bundling payments or coordination of care programs;        •    whether the Company’s revenues from Medicaid supplemental programs developed through a federally approved waiver program will be adversely affected because there may be reductions in available state and local government funding for the programs or the programs may be discontinued or modified; and        •    the impact of court challenges, the 2016 federal election and efforts to repeal or revise the Health Reform Law.  If our volume of patients with commercial insurance declines or we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with nongovernment payers, including managed care plans, our revenues may be reduced.  Nongovernment payers, including HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, typically reimburse health care providers at a higher rate than Medicare, Medicaid or other government health care programs. Reimbursement rates are set forth by contract when our facilities are in-network, and payers utilize plan structures to encourage or require the use of in-network providers. Revenues derived from nongovernment payers (domestic only) accounted for 55.2%, 54.4% and 54.6% of our revenues for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As a result, our ability to maintain or increase patient volumes covered by nongovernment payers and to maintain and obtain favorable contracts with nongovernment payers significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our facilities.  Nongovernment payers, including managed care payers, continue to demand discounted fee structures, and the trend toward consolidation among nongovernment payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. As various provisions of the Health Reform Law are implemented, including the Exchanges, nongovernment payers increasingly may demand reduced fees and utilize plan structures such as narrow networks and tiered networks that limit beneficiary provider choices or impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations when care is obtained from providers in a disfavored tier. Other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on terms favorable to us. It is not clear what impact, if any, the increased obligations on managed care payers and other payers imposed by the Health Reform Law will have on our ability to negotiate reimbursement increases and participate in plan networks on favorable terms. If we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with managed care plans or experience reductions in payment increases or amounts received from nongovernment payers, our revenues may be reduced.  Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.  The success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting and utilization practices of those physicians, maintaining good relations with those physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. Although we employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees of the hospitals at which they practice and, in many of the markets we serve, most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. Such physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. If we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those    39    Table of Contents  physicians and their patients, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline.  Our hospitals face competition for staffing, which may increase labor costs and reduce profitability.  Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our physicians. We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue to health care providers. We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Certain proposed changes in federal labor laws and the NLRB’s modification of its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, it is possible our labor costs could increase materially. When negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there is the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit admissions in order to meet the required ratios. If our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. Because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is constrained. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations.  If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.  The health care industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:        •    billing and coding for services and properly handling overpayments;        •    appropriateness and classification of level of care provided, including proper classification of inpatient admissions, observation services and outpatient care;        •    relationships with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients;        •    necessity and adequacy of medical care;        •    quality of medical equipment and services;        •    qualifications of medical and support personnel;        •    confidentiality, maintenance, data breach, identity theft and security issues associated with health-related and personal information and medical records;        •    screening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who have emergency medical conditions;        •    licensure, certification and enrollment with government programs;        •    hospital rate or budget review;        •    debt collection;        •    preparing and filing of cost reports;        •    operating policies and procedures;    40    Table of Contents     •    activities regarding competitors;        •    addition of facilities and services; and        •    environmental protection.  Among these laws are the federal Anti-kickback Statute, the federal Stark Law, the FCA and similar state laws. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians or who are the recipients of referrals, and these laws govern those relationships. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-kickback Statute but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. However, we cannot offer assurance that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute. Allegations of violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be brought under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, which requires a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute.  Our financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot provide assurance that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-kickback Statute, failure to meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature.  Additionally, if we violate the Anti-kickback Statute or Stark Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found to violate the FCA, either under a suit brought by the government or by a private person under a qui tam, or “whistleblower,” suit. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”  We also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls. In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the United Kingdom.  If we fail to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, including civil penalties, the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities, exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs and criminal penalties.  We do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of, or amendment to, these or other laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated these or other laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these or other laws, could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level may be adopted that adversely affect our business.    41    Table of Contents We have been and could become the subject of governmental investigations, claims and litigation.  Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. Further, under the FCA, private parties have the right to bring qui tam, or “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.  Governmental agencies and their agents, such as the MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs, conduct audits of our health care operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.  CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency fee basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program. The Health Reform Law expands the RAC program’s scope to include managed Medicare plans and Medicaid claims. RAC denials are appealable; however, there are currently significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges, which negatively impacts our ability to appeal RAC payment denials. In 2014, HHS offered to pay hospitals 68% of the net allowable amount associated with inpatient status claims denials in exchange for the withdrawal of all medical claims appealed. We accepted the settlement offer and executed an administrative agreement with HHS.  In addition, CMS employs MICs to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. The Health Reform Law increases federal funding for the MIC program. In addition to RACs and MICs, the state Medicaid agencies and other contractors have increased their review activities.  Should we be found out of compliance with any of these laws, regulations or programs, depending on the nature of the findings, our business, our financial position and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.  Changes to physician utilization practices and treatment methodologies, governmental or managed care controls designed to reduce inpatient services or surgical procedures and other factors outside our control that impact demand for medical services may reduce our revenues.  Controls imposed by Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid and commercial third-party payers designed to reduce admissions, intensity of services, surgical volumes and lengths of stay, in some instances referred to as “utilization review,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by health plans. The Medicare program also issues national or local coverage determinations that restrict the circumstances under which Medicare pays for certain services. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payer-required preadmission authorization, coverage restrictions and utilization review and by payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. For example, the Health Reform Law expanded the use of prepayment review by Medicare contractors by eliminating statutory restrictions on their use. Additionally, trends in physician treatment protocols and managed care health plan design, such as plans that shift increased costs and accountability for care to patients, could reduce our surgical volumes and admissions in favor of lower intensity and lower cost treatment methodologies.    42    Table of Contents Volume, admission and case-mix trends may be impacted by other factors beyond our control, such as changes in volume of certain high acuity services, variations in the prevalence and severity of outbreaks of influenza and other illnesses and medical conditions, seasonal and severe weather conditions, changes in treatment regimens and medical technology and other advances. These factors may reduce the demand for services we offer and decrease the reimbursement that we receive. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed, cost controls, changes to physician utilization practices, treatment methodologies, reimbursement rates and fees and other factors beyond our control could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.  Our overall business results may suffer during periods of general economic weakness.  Budget deficits at federal, state and local government entities have had a negative impact on spending, and may continue to negatively impact spending, for health and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant payer sources for our hospitals. Other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures (including delaying surgical procedures), potential increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and further difficulties in collecting patient copayment and deductible receivables.  The industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.  There is a trend in the health care industry toward value-based purchasing of health care services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events (also called “never events”). The Health Reform Law also prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat HACs. As of federal fiscal year 2015, the 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC rates in the designated performance period receive a 1% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments.  Hospitals with excess readmission rates for conditions designated by HHS will receive a reduction in their inpatient PPS operating Medicare payments for all Medicare inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excess readmission standard. The reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions is capped at 3% for federal fiscal year 2015 and subsequent years.  As required by the Health Reform Law, HHS has implemented a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services that reduces inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by 1.75% in federal fiscal year 2016. This percentage increases to 2% in federal fiscal year 2017 and for subsequent years. HHS pools the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS. HHS estimates that it will distribute $1.5 billion to hospitals in federal fiscal year 2016 based on their achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement (relative to the hospital’s own past performance). Hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise.  Beginning in April 2016, hospitals located in markets selected by CMS will be required to participate in the CJR model, a five-year mandatory bundled payment initiative focused on knee and hip replacements. Participating hospitals will be evaluated against quality standards and Medicare spending targets established by CMS for each episode of care. Depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls below the target and whether quality standards are met, hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare payments or owe repayments to CMS. Mandatory participation in demonstration projects, particularly demonstrations with the potential to affect payment, may negatively impact our results of operations.    43    Table of Contents Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. Further, we have implemented a policy pursuant to which we do not bill patients or third-party payers for fees or expenses incurred due to certain preventable adverse events.  We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. CMS has announced aggressive goals for adopting alternative payment models, which may include additional mandatory bundled or other alternative payment programs, and commercial insurers may also transition away from fee-for-service payment models. We are unable at this time to predict our future reductions and payments under these programs or how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues.  Our operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems.  The performance of our information systems is critical to our business operations. In addition to our shared services initiatives, our information systems are essential to a number of critical areas of our operations, including:        •    accounting and financial reporting;        •    billing and collecting accounts;        •    coding and compliance;        •    clinical systems;        •    medical records and document storage;        •    inventory management;        •    negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts and supply contracts; and        •    monitoring quality of care and collecting data on quality measures necessary for full Medicare payment updates.  Information systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts and natural disasters. We have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our information systems. Nevertheless, we may experience system failures. The occurrence of any system failure could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of systems, all of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.  A cybersecurity incident could result in a loss of confidential data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, or other common law theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.  We collect and store on our networks sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our patients and employees. In addition, we have made significant investments in technology to adopt and utilize EHR and to become meaningful users of health information technology. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations. We have implemented multiple layers of security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data through technology, processes, and our people. We utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against information systems create risk of cybersecurity incidents. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to cybersecurity incidents    44    Table of Contents  that bypass our security measures, result in loss of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems or business. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our information systems from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The occurrence of any of these events could result in (i) business interruptions and delays; (ii) the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data; (iii) litigation and potential liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or other applicable laws; and (iv) federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.  If we fail to continue to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record systems, or if the transition to the ICD-10 coding system affects our billing or collections, our operations could be adversely affected.  As of 2015, eligible hospitals and eligible professionals that have failed to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in an applicable prior reporting period are subject to reduced payments from Medicare. Failure to continue to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.  Health plans and providers, including our hospitals, were required to transition by October 1, 2015 to the new ICD-10 coding system, which greatly expands the number and detail of billing codes used for inpatient claims. The transition to the more detailed ICD-10 coding system could result in decreased reimbursement if the use of ICD-10 codes results in conditions being reclassified to MS-DRGs or commercial payer payment groupings with lower levels of reimbursement than assigned under the previous system.  The emergence and effects related to a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease could adversely affect our operations.  If a pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis were to occur in an area in which we operate, our operations could be adversely affected. Such a crisis could diminish the public trust in health care facilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose, or are treating (or have treated) patients affected by infectious diseases. If any of our facilities were involved, or perceived as being involved, in treating patients from such an infectious disease, patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care at our facilities. Further, a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak might adversely affect our operations by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or by causing staffing shortages in our facilities. We have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, but the potential emergence of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak is difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations.  State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to operate and expand our operations.  Some states, particularly in the eastern part of the country, require health care providers to obtain prior approval, often known as a CON, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make changes in services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services. The failure to obtain any requested CON or other required approval could impair our ability to operate or expand operations. Any such failure could, in turn, adversely affect our ability to attract patients and physicians to our facilities and grow our revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.    45    Table of Contents We may encounter difficulty acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses, encounter challenges integrating the operations of acquired hospitals and other health care businesses and become liable for unknown or contingent liabilities as a result of acquisitions.  A component of our business strategy is acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses. We may encounter difficulty acquiring new facilities or other businesses as a result of competition from other purchasers that may be willing to pay purchase prices that are higher than we believe are reasonable. Some states require CONs in order to acquire a hospital or other facility or to expand facilities or services. In addition, the acquisition of health care facilities often involves licensure approvals or reviews and complex change of ownership processes for Medicare and other payers. Further, many states have laws that restrict the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. These laws may require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification of the attorney general or other regulators and community involvement. Attorneys general in states without specific requirements may exercise broad discretionary authority over transactions involving the sale of not-for-profits under their general obligations to protect the use of charitable assets. These conversion legislative and administrative efforts often focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the non-profit seller and may include consideration of commitments for capital improvements and charity care by the purchaser. Also, the increasingly challenging regulatory and enforcement environment may negatively impact our ability to acquire health care businesses if they are found to have material unresolved compliance issues, such as repayment obligations. Resolving compliance issues as well as completion of oversight, review or approval processes could seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals or other businesses and increase our acquisition costs.  We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate hospitals and other businesses that we acquire with our ongoing operations, or we may experience delays implementing operating procedures and systems. Hospitals and other health care businesses that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with health care and other laws and regulations, medical and general professional liabilities, workers’ compensation liabilities and tax liabilities. Although we typically exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations, experience liability in excess of any indemnification obtained or otherwise incur material liabilities for the pre-acquisition conduct of acquired businesses. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs could harm our business and results of operations.  Our facilities are heavily concentrated in Florida and Texas, which makes us sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states.  We operated 168 hospitals at December 31, 2015, and 81 of those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. Our Florida and Texas facilities’ combined revenues represented approximately 47% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. This concentration makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.  In addition, our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other areas across the Gulf Coast are located in hurricane-prone areas. In the past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other coastal states and the patient populations in those states. Our business activities could be harmed by a particularly active hurricane season or even a single storm, and the property insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover losses from future hurricanes or other natural disasters.  We may be subject to liabilities from claims by taxing authorities.  The IRS Examination Division began an audit of HCA Holdings, Inc.’s 2011 and 2012 federal income tax returns during 2014. We are also subject to examination by state and foreign taxing authorities.    46    Table of Contents Management believes HCA Holdings, Inc., its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS, state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.  We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.  We are subject to litigation relating to our business practices, including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. Many of these actions seek large sums of money as damages and involve significant defense costs. We insure a portion of our professional liability risks through a 100% owned subsidiary. Management believes our reserves for self-insured retentions and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover insured claims arising out of the operation of our facilities. Our 100% owned liability insurance subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance contracts; however, the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. If payments for claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, are not covered by insurance, or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.  We are exposed to market risk related to changes in the market values of securities and interest rate changes.  We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $478 million and $4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2015, we had a net unrealized gain of $20 million on the insurance subsidiaries’ investment securities.  We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments on long-term investments in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue specific factors.  We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities.  The Investors may continue to have influence over us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future.  On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. was acquired by a private investor group, including affiliates of or funds sponsored by Bain Capital Partners, LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., BAML Capital Partners and HCA founder, Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Jr. (collectively, the “Investors”) and by members of management and certain other investors. Through their investment in Hercules Holding II, LLC, certain of the Investors continue to hold a significant interest in our outstanding common stock (approximately 21% as of January 31, 2016). In addition, pursuant to a shareholders agreement we entered into with Hercules Holding II, LLC, certain representatives of the Investors have the continued right to nominate certain of the members of our Board of Directors. As a result, certain of the Investors potentially have the ability to influence our decisions to enter into corporate transactions    47    Table of Contents  (and the terms thereof) and prevent changes in the composition of our Board of Directors and any transaction that requires stockholder approval.  Additionally, the Investors are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. One or more of the Investors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.
