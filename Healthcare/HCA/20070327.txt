Item 1A. Risk Factors   Risk Factors   If any of the events discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also constrain our business and operations.   Our Substantial Leverage Could Adversely Affect Our Ability To Raise Additional Capital To Fund Our Operations, Limit Our Ability To React To Changes In The Economy Or Our Industry, Expose Us To Interest Rate Risk To The Extent Of Our Variable Rate Debt And Prevent Us From Meeting Our Obligations.   On November 17, 2006, we consummated the Merger with Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hercules Holding, pursuant to which the Investors acquired all of our outstanding shares of common stock for $51.00 per share in cash. The Merger, the financing transactions related to the Merger and other related transactions had a transaction value of approximately $33.0 billion and are collectively referred to in this annual report as the “Recapitalization.” As a result of the Recapitalization, our outstanding common stock is owned by Hercules Holding, certain members of management and other key employees, and certain other investors. Our common stock is no longer registered with the SEC and is no longer traded on a national securities exchange.  21   Table of Contents  Since completing the Recapitalization, we are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2006, our total indebtedness was $28.408 billion. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:            •   increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;         •   requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;         •   exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our unhedged borrowings will be at variable rates of interest;         •   limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures;         •   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product or service line development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and         •   limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.    We and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.           Our Debt Agreements Contain Restrictions That Limit Our Flexibility In Operating Our Business.    Our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:            •   incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;         •   pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;         •   make certain investments;         •   sell or transfer assets;         •   create liens;         •   consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and         •   enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.    Under our asset-based revolving credit facility, when (and for as long as) the combined availability under our asset-based revolving credit facility and our senior secured revolving credit facility is less than a specified amount, for a certain period of time, or if a payment or bankruptcy event of default has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into any of our depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and to cash collateralize letters of credit issued thereunder.   Under our senior secured credit facilities we will be required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under both of our senior secured credit facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior secured credit facilities, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure each such indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion  22   Table of Contents  of our assets as collateral under our senior secured credit facilities and our existing senior secured notes. If any of the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our senior secured credit facilities and our outstanding notes.           Our Hospitals Face Competition For Patients From Other Hospitals And Health Care Providers.    The health care business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the local communities served by most of our hospitals provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals. In 2005, CMS began making public performance data related to ten quality measures that hospitals submit in connection with their Medicare reimbursement. On February 8, 2006, DRA 2005 was enacted by Congress and expanded the number of quality measures that must be reported to 21, beginning with discharges occurring in the third quarter of 2006. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on these 21 quality measures, patient volumes could decline. In addition, DRA 2005 requires that CMS expand the number of quality measures in future years. On November 1, 2006, CMS announced a final rule that expands to 26 the number of quality measures that must be reported, beginning in the first quarter of calendar year 2007, and requires, beginning in the third quarter of calendar year 2007, that hospitals report the results of a 27-question patient perspective survey. The additional quality measures and future trends toward clinical transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volumes.   In addition, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment. Some of the hospitals that compete with our hospitals are owned by governmental agencies or not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis. Our hospitals are facing increasing competition from physician-owned specialty hospitals and from both our own and unaffiliated freestanding surgery centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel. If ambulatory surgery centers are better able to compete in this environment than our hospitals, our hospitals may experience a decline in patient volume, and we may experience a decrease in margin, even if those patients use our ambulatory surgery centers. Further, if our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities than our hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers, we may experience an overall decline in patient volume. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.”   Section 507 of MMA provided for an 18-month moratorium on the establishment of new specialty hospitals. The moratorium expired on June 8, 2005. However, HHS suspended processing new provider enrollment applications for specialty hospitals until January 2006, creating, in effect, a new moratorium on specialty hospitals. DRA 2005 directed HHS to extend this enrollment suspension until the earlier of six months from the enactment of DRA 2005 or the release of a report regarding physician owned specialty hospitals by HHS. On August 8, 2006, HHS issued its final report, in which it announced that it would resume processing and certifying provider enrollment applications. As a result of the moratorium being rescinded, we face additional competition from an increased number of specialty hospitals, including hospitals owned by physicians currently on staff at our hospitals. In addition, HHS announced that it will require all hospitals to disclose any physician ownership and certain financial arrangements with physicians. HHS has not announced when it will begin collecting this data, the specific data that hospitals will be required to submit or which hospitals will be required to provide information.           The Growth Of Uninsured And Patient Due Accounts And A Deterioration In The Collectibility Of These Accounts Could Adversely Affect Our Results Of Operations.    The primary collection risks of our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly from patients.  23   Table of Contents  The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal and state governmental and private employer health care coverage, the rate of growth in uninsured patient admissions and other collection indicators. At December 31, 2006, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 86% of the $3.972 billion patient due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for which eligibility for Medicaid coverage was being evaluated (“pending Medicaid accounts”). For the year ended December 31, 2006, the provision for doubtful accounts increased to 10.4% of revenues compared to 9.6% of revenues in 2005. Adjusting for the effect of the uninsured discount policy implemented January 1, 2005, the provision for doubtful accounts was 14.1% and 12.4% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.   A continuation of the trends that have resulted in an increasing proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured accounts and a deterioration in the collectibility of these accounts will adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.           Changes In Governmental Interpretations May Negatively Impact Our Ability To Obtain Reimbursement Of Medicare Bad Debts    The Medicare program will reimburse 70% of bad debts related to deductibles and coinsurance for patients with Medicare coverage, after the provider has made a reasonable effort to collect these amounts. On March 30, 2006, the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan entered a final order in Battle Creek Health System v. Thompson, which provided that reasonable collection efforts have not been satisfied as long as the Medicare accounts remained with an external collection agency. The case is under appeal at the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. We utilize extensive in-house and external collection efforts for our accounts receivable, including deductible and coinsurance amounts owed by patients with Medicare coverage. However, we utilize a secondary collection agency after in-house and primary collection agency efforts have been unsuccessful. As a result of the Battle Creek decision, we contacted CMS and outlined our collection process and the reasons for our belief that Medicare bad debts could be claimed for reimbursement after exhaustion of collection efforts at the primary collection agency, but while the accounts were still pending with the secondary collection agency. CMS has responded to us consistent with the Battle Creek decision. We are in continued discussions with CMS concerning the proper timing to claim reimbursement for Medicare bad debts. We incur approximately $30 million of Medicare bad debts per year that are subject to the Battle Creek decision. We are unable to predict the outcome of the Battle Creek case or CMS’s final answer on the use of external collection agencies. We are currently evaluating possible modifications to our accounts receivable collection processes that will both provide us with reasonable collection results and comply with CMS’s interpretation of reasonable collection efforts.           Changes In Governmental Programs May Reduce Our Revenues.    A significant portion of our patient volumes is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. We derived approximately 58% of our admissions from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2006. In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under these government programs. Such changes may also increase our operating costs, which could reduce our profitability.   Effective January 1, 2007, as a result of DRA 2005, reimbursements for ASC overhead costs are limited to no more than the overhead costs paid to hospital outpatient departments under the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system for the same procedure. On August 8, 2006 CMS announced proposed regulations that, if adopted, would change payment for procedures performed in an ASC, effective January 1, 2008. Under this proposal, ASC payment groups would increase from the current nine clinically disparate payment groups to the 221 Ambulatory Procedure Classification groups (APCs) used under the outpatient prospective payment system for these surgical services. CMS estimates that the rates for procedures performed in an ASC setting would equal 62% of the corresponding rates paid for the same procedures performed in an outpatient hospital setting. Moreover, under the proposed regulations, if CMS determines  24   Table of Contents  that a procedure is commonly performed in a physician’s office, the ASC reimbursement for that procedure would be limited to the reimbursement allowable under the Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule. In addition, under this proposal, all surgical procedures, other than those that pose a significant safety risk or generally require an overnight stay, which would be listed by CMS, would be payable as ASC procedures. This will expand the number of procedures that Medicare will pay for if performed in an ASC. CMS indicates in its discussion of the proposed regulations that it believes that the volumes and service mix of procedures provided in ASCs would change significantly in 2008 under the revised payment system, but that CMS is not able to accurately project those changes. If the proposal is adopted, more Medicare procedures that are now performed in hospitals, such as ours, may be moved to ASCs reducing surgical volume in our hospitals. Also, more Medicare procedures that are now performed in ASCs, such as ours, may be moved to physicians’ offices. Commercial third-party payers may adopt similar policies.   On August 1, 2006, CMS announced a final rule that refines the DRG payment system. CMS announced that it is considering additional changes effective in federal fiscal year 2008. We cannot predict the impact that any such changes, if finalized, would have on our revenues. Future realignments in the DRG system could also reduce the margins we receive for certain specialties, including cardiology and orthopedics. In fact, the greater popularity of specialty hospitals in recent years has caused CMS to focus on payment levels for such specialties. Any such change in the payments received for specialty services could have an adverse effect on our revenues and could require us to modify our strategy. Other Medicare payment changes may also affect our revenues. See Item 1. “Business — Sources of Revenue.” DRG rates are updated and DRG weights are recalibrated each federal fiscal year. The index used to update the market basket gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside the health care industry in purchasing goods and services. MMA, as amended by DRA 2005, provides for DRG increases using the full market basket if data for certain patient care quality indicators is submitted quarterly to CMS, and using the market basket minus two percentage points if such data is not submitted. While we will endeavor to comply with all data submission requirements, our submissions may not be deemed timely or sufficient to entitle us to the full market basket adjustment for all of our hospitals.   Since states must operate with balanced budgets and since the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. DRA 2005, signed into law on February 8, 2006, includes Medicaid cuts of approximately $4.8 billion over five years. In addition, proposed regulatory changes, if implemented, would reduce federal Medicaid funding by an additional $12.2 billion over five years. On January 18, 2007, CMS published a proposed rule entitled “Medicaid Program; Cost Limits for Providers Operated by Units of Government and Provisions to Ensure the Integrity of Federal-State Financial Partnership.” The proposed rule, if finalized, could significantly impact state Medicaid programs. It is uncertain if the rule will be finalized. States have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage and program eligibility, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. Future legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of government health programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.           Demands Of Nongovernment Payers May Adversely Affect Our Growth In Revenues.    Our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with nongovernment payers, including managed care plans, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of most of our hospitals. Admissions derived from managed care and other insurers accounted for approximately 36% of our admissions in 2006. Nongovernment payers, including managed care payers, increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures, and the trend toward consolidation among nongovernment payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. Reductions in price increases or the amounts received from managed care, commercial insurance or other payers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.  25   Table of Contents          Our Performance Depends On Our Ability To Recruit And Retain Quality Physicians.    Physicians generally direct the majority of hospital admissions, and the success of our hospitals depends, therefore, in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and maintaining good relations with those physicians. Physicians are generally not employees of the hospitals at which they practice and, in many of the markets that we serve, most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. Such physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. If we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline.           Our Hospitals Face Competition For Staffing, Which May Increase Labor Costs And Reduce Profitability.    Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our physicians. We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has become a significant operating issue to health care providers. This shortage may require us to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. In addition, to the extent that a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, or attempts to unionize, our labor costs could increase. If our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. Because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is constrained. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations.           If We Fail To Comply With Extensive Laws And Government Regulations, We Could Suffer Penalties Or Be Required To Make Significant Changes To Our Operations.    The health care industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:            •   billing for services;         •   relationships with physicians and other referral sources;         •   adequacy of medical care;         •   quality of medical equipment and services;         •   qualifications of medical and support personnel;         •   confidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with health-related information and medical records;         •   the screening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who have emergency medical conditions;         •   licensure;         •   hospital rate or budget review;         •   operating policies and procedures; and         •   addition of facilities and services.   26   Table of Contents  Among these laws are the Anti-kickback Statute, the Stark Law and the False Claims Act and similar state laws. These laws impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals and other health care facilities, including employment contracts, leases and professional service agreements. We also have similar relationships with physicians and facilities to which patients are referred from our facilities from time to time. We also provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into the communities served by our hospitals. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-kickback Statute but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny; however, we cannot assure you that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute. Allegations of violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may also be brought under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, which requires a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute.   Our financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot assure you that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-kickback Statute, failure to meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature.   Additionally, if we violate the Anti-kickback Statute or Stark Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found to violate the False Claims Act, either under a suit brought by the government or by a private person under a qui tam, or “whistleblower,” suit.   If we fail to comply with the Anti-kickback Statute, the Stark Law, the False Claims Act or other applicable laws and regulations, or if we fail to maintain an effective corporate compliance program, we could be subjected to liabilities, including civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs and, for violations of certain laws and regulations, criminal penalties. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”   Because many of these laws and their implementation regulations are relatively new, we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could have a material, adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level may be adopted that adversely affect our business.           We Have Been The Subject Of Governmental Investigations, Claims And Litigation    Commencing in 1997, we became aware that we were the subject of governmental investigations and litigation relating to our business practices. The investigations were concluded through a series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003. In January 2001, we entered into an eight-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the OIG. Under the CIA, we have numerous affirmative obligations, including the requirement that we report potential violations of applicable federal health care laws and regulations and have, pursuant to this obligation, reported a number of potential violations of the Stark Law, the Anti-kickback Statute, EMTALA and other laws, most of which we consider to be nonviolations or technical violations. Although no government agency has taken any adverse action related to the CIA disclosures, the government could  27   Table of Contents  determine that our reporting and/or our resolution of reported issues have been inadequate. If we are found to be in violation of the CIA or any applicable health care laws or regulations, we could be subject to repayment requirements, substantial monetary fines, civil penalties, exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs, and, for violations of certain laws and regulations, criminal penalties. Any such sanctions or expenses could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.   In September 2005, we received a subpoena from the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York seeking the production of documents. Also in September 2005, we were informed that the SEC had issued a formal order of investigation. Both the subpoena and the formal order of investigation relate to trading in our securities. We are cooperating fully with these investigations.   Subsequently, we and certain of our executive officers and directors were named in various federal securities law class actions and several shareholders have filed derivative lawsuits purportedly on behalf of the Company. Additionally, a former employee filed a complaint against certain of our executive officers pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and we have been served with a shareholder demand letter addressed to our Board of Directors. We cannot predict the results of the investigations or any related lawsuits or the effect that findings in such investigations or lawsuits adverse to us may have on us. We have, however, reached an agreement in principle for the settlement of the derivative lawsuits.   On July 24, 2006, we announced that we had entered into the Merger Agreement. In connection with the Merger, we are aware of eight asserted class action lawsuits related to the Merger filed against us, certain of our executive officers, our directors and the Sponsors, and one lawsuit filed against us and one of our affiliates seeking enforcement of contractual obligations allegedly arising from the Merger. Certain of these lawsuits, though not all, are the subject of an agreement in principle to settle. Additional lawsuits pertaining to the Merger could be filed in the future. These proceedings are described in greater detail under Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”   Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. Further, under the federal False Claims Act, private parties have the right to bring qui tam, or “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to the government. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. From time to time, companies doing business under federal health care programs may be contacted by various governmental agencies in connection with a government investigation either brought by the government or by a private person under a qui tam action. Because of the confidential nature of some government investigations or a confidential seal under the federal False Claims Act, we do not always know the particulars of the allegations or concerns at the time the government notifies us that an investigation is proceeding. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities from time to time may receive, government inquiries from federal and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.   From time to time, governmental agencies and their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the OIG, conduct audits of our health care operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.           Controls Designed To Reduce Inpatient Services May Reduce Our Revenues.    Controls imposed by Medicare and commercial third-party payers designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as “utilization review,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by health plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payer-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose  28   Table of Contents  more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. Although we are unable to predict the effect these changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.           Our Operations Could Be Impaired By A Failure Of Our Information Systems.    Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or availability of our systems could adversely affect operations or delay the collection of revenue. Even though we have implemented network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, or cessations in the availability of systems, all of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.   The performance of our sophisticated information technology and systems is critical to our business operations. In addition to our shared services initiatives, our information systems are essential to a number of critical areas of our operations, including:            •   accounting and financial reporting;         •   billing and collecting accounts;         •   coding and compliance;         •   clinical systems;         •   medical records and document storage;         •   inventory management; and         •   negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts and supply contracts.    We are in the process of implementing projects to replace our payroll and human resources information systems. Management estimates that the payroll and human resources system projects will require total expenditures of approximately $333 million to develop and install. At December 31, 2006, project-to-date costs incurred were $295 million ($160 million of the costs incurred have been capitalized and $135 million have been expensed). Management expects that the system development, testing, data conversion and installation will continue through 2007.           State Efforts To Regulate The Construction Or Expansion Of Hospitals Could Impair Our Ability To Operate And Expand Our Operations.    Some states, particularly in the eastern part of the country, require health care providers to obtain prior approval, known as a certificate of need, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make changes in services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. We currently operate hospitals in a number of states with certificate of need laws. The failure to obtain any requested certificate of need could impair our ability to operate or expand operations. Any such failure could, in turn, adversely affect our ability to attract patients to our hospitals and grow our revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.           Our Facilities Are Heavily Concentrated In Florida And Texas, Which Makes Us Sensitive To Regulatory, Economic, Environmental And Competitive Changes In Those States.    We operated 173 hospitals at December 31, 2006, and 73 of those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. Our Florida and Texas facilities’ combined revenues represented approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006. This concentration makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in those states. Any material change in the  29   Table of Contents  current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.   In addition, our hospitals in Florida and Texas and other areas across the Gulf Coast are located in hurricane-prone areas. In the recent past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other coastal states, and the patient populations in those states. Our business activities could be harmed by a particularly active hurricane season or even a single storm. In addition, the premiums to renew our property insurance policy for 2006 and 2007 increased significantly over premiums incurred in 2005. Our new policy also includes an increase in the stated deductible and we were not able to obtain coverage in the amounts we have had under our policies prior to 2006. As a result of such increases in premiums and deductibles, we expect that our cash flows and profitability will be adversely affected. In addition, the property insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover losses from future hurricanes or other natural disasters.           We May Be Subject To Liabilities From Claims By The IRS.    We are currently contesting claims for income taxes, interest and penalties proposed by the IRS for prior years aggregating approximately $678 million through December 31, 2006. The disputed items include the deductibility of a portion of the 2001 government settlement payment, the timing of recognition of certain patient service revenues in 2000 through 2002, the method for calculating the tax allowance for uncollectible accounts in 2002 and the amount of insurance expense deducted in 1999 through 2002.   During 2006, the IRS began an examination of our 2003 through 2004 federal income tax returns. The IRS has not determined the amount of any additional income tax, interest and penalties that it may claim upon completion of this examination or any future examinations that may be initiated. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Pending IRS Disputes.”           We May Be Subject To Liabilities From Claims Brought Against Our Facilities.    We are subject to litigation relating to our business practices, including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.” Many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs. We insure a substantial portion of our professional liability risks through a wholly-owned subsidiary. Management believes our insurance coverage is sufficient to cover claims arising out of the operation of our facilities. Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance contracts, and the obligations covered by the reinsurance contracts are included in its reserves for professional liability risks, as the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. If payments for claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, are not covered by insurance or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.           We Are Exposed To Market Risks Related To Changes In The Market Values Of Securities And Interest Rate Changes.    We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investments in debt and equity securities of our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were $2.129 billion and $14 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. The fair value of investments is generally based on quoted market prices. At December 31, 2006, we had a net unrealized gain of $25 million on the insurance subsidiary’s investment securities.   We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The net interest payments based on the notional amounts in these agreements generally match the timing of the cash flows of the related liabilities. The notional amounts of the  30   Table of Contents  swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not assets or liabilities of HCA. Any market risk or opportunity associated with these swap agreements is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”           Since The Merger, The Investors Control Us And May Have Conflicts Of Interest With Us In The Future.    The Investors indirectly own approximately 97.5% of our capital stock due to the Recapitalization. As a result, the Investors have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders. For example, the Investors could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness or sell assets.   Additionally, the Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. One or more of the Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as investment funds associated with or designated by the Sponsors continue to indirectly own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.  31   Table of Contents      Item 1B.
