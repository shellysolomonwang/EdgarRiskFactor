    <TD>On November&nbsp;3, 2009, Merck &#038; Co., Inc. (&#147;Old Merck&#148;) and Schering-Plough Corporation
(&#147;Schering-Plough&#148;) completed their previously-announced merger (the &#147;Merger&#148;). In the Merger,
Schering-Plough acquired all of the shares of Old Merck, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Schering-Plough and was renamed Merck Sharp &#038; Dohme Corp. Schering-Plough continued as the
surviving public company and was renamed Merck &#038; Co., Inc. (&#147;New Merck&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;).
However, for accounting purposes only, the Merger was treated as an acquisition with Old Merck
considered the accounting acquirer. The results of Schering-Plough&#146;s business have been included
in New Merck&#146;s financial statements only for periods subsequent to the completion of the Merger.
Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements reflect Old Merck&#146;s stand-alone operations as
they existed prior to the completion of the Merger. References in these financial statements to
&#147;Merck&#148; for periods prior to the Merger refer to Old Merck and for periods after the completion of
the Merger to New Merck.</TD>

    <TD>In June&nbsp;2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued an amendment to the
accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets, which is effective
January&nbsp;1, 2010. The amendment eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity,
changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and requires enhanced disclosures to
provide financial statement users with greater transparency about transfers of financial assets,
including securitization transactions, and an entity&#146;s continuing involvement in and exposure to
the risks related to transferred financial assets. The effect of adoption on the Company&#146;s
financial position and results of operations was not material.</TD>

    <TD>Also, in June&nbsp;2009, the FASB amended the existing accounting and disclosure guidance for the

    <TD>In October&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued new guidance for revenue recognition with multiple
deliverables, which is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
fiscal years beginning on or after June&nbsp;15, 2010, although early adoption is permitted. This
guidance eliminates the residual method under the current guidance and replaces it with the
&#147;relative selling price&#148; method when allocating revenue in a multiple deliverable arrangement. The
selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence of
selling price, if it exists, otherwise third-party evidence of selling price shall be used. If
neither exists for a deliverable, the vendor shall use its best estimate of the selling price for
that deliverable. After adoption, this guidance will also require expanded qualitative and
quantitative disclosures. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adoption on its
financial position and results of operations.</TD>

    <TD>In January&nbsp;2010, the FASB amended the existing disclosure guidance on fair value measurements,
which is effective January&nbsp;1, 2010, except for disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and
settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which is effective
January&nbsp;1, 2011. Among other things, the updated guidance requires additional disclosure for the
amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 measurements and requires
certain Level 3 disclosures on a gross basis. Additionally, the updates amend existing guidance to
require a greater level of disaggregated information and more robust disclosures about valuation
techniques and inputs to fair value measurements. Since the amended guidance requires only
additional disclosures, the adoption of the provisions effective January&nbsp;1, 2010 did not, and for
the provisions effective in 2011 will not, impact the Company&#146;s financial position or results of
operations.</TD>

consideration of $49.6&nbsp;billion. The Merger expanded the Company&#146;s pipeline of product candidates,
broadened the Company&#146;s commercial portfolio, expanded its global presence and increased its
manufacturing capabilities. Additionally, the Company expects to realize substantial cost savings
and synergies, including opportunities for consolidation in both sales and marketing and research

    <TD>A preliminary allocation of the consideration transferred to the net assets of Schering-Plough

changes the most significant of which included an increase to <I>Other intangibles, net </I>of $122.5

increase to <I>Goodwill </I>of $216.9&nbsp;million. Additional adjustments to the preliminary values of assets

(the &#147;Merger Restructuring Program&#148;) in conjunction with the integration of the legacy Merck and
legacy Schering-Plough businesses. This Merger Restructuring Program is intended to optimize the
cost structure of the combined Company. As part of the first phase of the Merger Restructuring
Program, by the end of 2012, the Company expects to reduce its total workforce by approximately 15%
across all areas of the Company worldwide. The Company also plans to eliminate 2,500 vacant
positions as part of the first phase of the program. These workforce reductions will primarily
come from the elimination of duplicative positions in sales, administrative and headquarters
organizations, as well as from the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities and research
and development operations. The Company will continue to hire new employees in strategic growth
areas of the business during this period. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, approximately 5,290 positions have been eliminated in connection with the Merger Restructuring Program, comprised of employee separations,
and the elimination of contractors and vacant positions. Certain actions, such as the ongoing
reevaluation of manufacturing and research and development facilities worldwide have not yet been

of the 2008 Restructuring Program, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 7,200 positions

2010, approximately 5,445 positions have been eliminated in connection with the 2008 Restructuring
Program, comprised of employee separations and the elimination of contractors and vacant positions.
The program includes the roll out of a new, more customer-centric selling model. The Company is
also making greater use of outside technology resources, centralizing common sales and marketing
activities, and consolidating and streamlining its operations. Merck&#146;s manufacturing division is

Restructuring Program and 535 positions related to the 2008 Restructuring Program. In the first

Restructuring Program. These position eliminations were comprised of actual headcount reductions,

than write them off immediately. The site assets include manufacturing and research facilities and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">In February&nbsp;2010, the Company completed the acquisition of Avecia Biologics Limited (&#147;Avecia&#148;)
for a total purchase price of approximately $190&nbsp;million. Avecia is a contract manufacturing
organization with specific expertise in microbial-derived biologics. Under the terms of the
agreement, the Company acquired Avecia and all of its assets, including all of Avecia&#146;s process
development and scale-up, manufacturing, quality and business support operations located in
Billingham, United Kingdom. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination;
accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective fair
values as of the acquisition date. The determination of fair value requires management to make
significant estimates and assumptions. In connection with the acquisition, substantially all of
the purchase price was allocated to Avecia&#146;s property, plant and equipment and goodwill. The
remaining net assets acquired were not material. This transaction closed on February&nbsp;1, 2010, and
accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired business have been included in the Company&#146;s
results of operations beginning after the acquisition date. Pro forma financial information has not been
included because Avecia&#146;s historical financial results are not significant when compared with the
Company&#146;s financial results.

    <TD>In 1998, a subsidiary of Schering-Plough entered into a licensing agreement with Centocor,
Inc. (&#147;Centocor&#148;), now a Johnson &#038; Johnson company, to market <I>Remicade, </I>which is prescribed for the
treatment of inflammatory diseases. In 2005, Schering-Plough&#146;s subsidiary exercised an option
under its contract with Centocor for license rights to develop and commercialize <I>Simponi</I>
(golimumab), a fully human monoclonal antibody. The Company has exclusive marketing rights to both
products outside the United States, Japan and certain Asian markets. In December&nbsp;2007,
Schering-Plough and Centocor revised their distribution agreement regarding the development,
commercialization and distribution of both <I>Remicade </I>and <I>Simponi</I>, extending the Company&#146;s rights to
exclusively market <I>Remicade </I>to match the duration of the Company&#146;s exclusive marketing rights for
<I>Simponi</I>. In addition, Schering-Plough and Centocor agreed to share certain development costs
relating to <I>Simponi&#146;s </I>auto-injector delivery system. On October&nbsp;6, 2009, the European Commission
approved <I>Simponi </I>as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and other immune system disorders in two
presentations &#151; a novel auto-injector and a prefilled syringe. As a result, the Company&#146;s
marketing rights for both products extend for 15&nbsp;years from the first commercial sale of <I>Simponi </I>in
the European Union (&#147;EU&#148;) following the receipt of pricing and reimbursement approval within the
EU. After operating expenses and subject to certain adjustments, the Company is entitled to
receive an approximate 60% share of profits on the Company&#146;s distribution in the Company&#146;s
marketing territory through December&nbsp;31, 2009. Beginning in 2010, the share of profits will change
over time to a 50% share of profits by 2014 for both products and the share of profits will remain
fixed thereafter for the remainder of the term. The Company may independently develop and market
<I>Simponi </I>for a Crohn&#146;s disease indication in its territories, with an option for Centocor to
participate. See Note 10 for a discussion of the arbitration involving the <I>Remicade/Simponi</I>
product rights.</TD>

    <TD>A significant portion of the Company&#146;s revenues are denominated in foreign currencies. Merck
relies on sustained cash flows generated from foreign sources to support its long-term commitment

diminished as a result of a strengthening dollar, the Company&#146;s ability to fund research and other

    <TD>The objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the potential for longer-term
unfavorable changes in foreign exchange to decrease the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows
derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro and Japanese yen. To achieve
this objective, the Company will partially hedge forecasted foreign currency denominated
third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales that are expected to occur over its planning
cycle, typically no more than three years into the future. The Company will layer in hedges over
time, increasing the portion of third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales hedged as it

volatilities and correlations, and the cost of hedging instruments. The hedged anticipated sales

    <TD>the hedged risk in the same manner. The Company manages its anticipated transaction exposure
principally with purchased local currency put options, which provide the Company with a right, but
not an obligation, to sell foreign currencies in the future at a predetermined price. If the U.S.
dollar strengthens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, total changes in the
options cash flows offset the decline in the expected future U.S. dollar cash flows of the hedged
foreign currency sales. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar weakens, the options value reduces to
zero, but the Company benefits from the increase in the value of the anticipated foreign currency
cash flows. The Company also utilizes forward contracts in its revenue hedging program. If the
U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, the increase in
the fair value of the forward contracts offsets the decrease in the expected future U.S. dollar
cash flows of the hedged foreign currency sales. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar weakens, the
decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts offsets the increase in the value of the
anticipated foreign currency cash flows.</TD>

    <TD>The fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain positions)

derivative contracts are recorded each period in either current earnings or <I>Other comprehensive

and if so, the type of hedge transaction. Accordingly, for derivatives that are designated as cash

    <TD>Where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries, the
primary objective of the balance sheet risk management program is to protect the U.S. dollar value
of foreign currency denominated net monetary assets from the effects of volatility in foreign
exchange that might occur prior to their conversion to U.S. dollars. In these instances, Merck
principally utilizes forward exchange contracts, which enable the Company to buy and sell foreign
currencies in the future at fixed exchange rates and economically offset the consequences of
changes in foreign exchange on the amount of U.S. dollar cash flows derived from the net assets.
Where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries, Merck
executes spot trades to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars based on short-term forecast
needs. These U.S. dollar proceeds are then invested until required by the Company&#146;s foreign
subsidiaries. Merck routinely enters into contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures
denominated in developed country currencies, primarily the euro and Japanese yen. For exposures in
developing country currencies, the Company will enter into forward contracts to partially offset
the effects of exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit
analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the exchange rate and the
cost of the hedging instrument. The Company will also minimize the effect of exchange on monetary
assets and liabilities by managing operating activities and net asset positions at the local level.</TD>

    <TD>Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Entities
are required to use a fair value hierarchy which maximizes the use of observable inputs and
minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of
inputs that may be used to measure fair value:</TD>

assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. The Company&#146;s Level 2
assets and liabilities primarily include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less
frequently than exchange-traded instruments, corporate notes and bonds, U.S. and foreign government
and agency securities, certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, municipal securities,

financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair
value requires significant judgment or estimation. The Company&#146;s Level 3 assets mainly include
certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities with limited market activity. At March&nbsp;31, 2010, $20.0&nbsp;million, or approximately 0.5%, of the

    <TD>Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing
models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model
assumption or input is unobservable. Level 3 financial assets also include certain investment
securities for which there is limited market activity such that the determination of fair value
requires significant judgment or estimation. The Company&#146;s Level 3 investment securities at March
31, 2010, primarily include certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities for which there was a decrease in the observability of market pricing for
these investments. These securities were valued primarily using pricing models for which
management understands the methodologies. These models incorporate transaction details such as
contractual terms, maturity, timing and amount of future cash inflows, as well as assumptions about
liquidity and credit valuation adjustments of marketplace participants at March&nbsp;31, 2010.</TD>

    <TD>In 1998, Old Merck and Astra completed the restructuring of the ownership and operations of
their existing joint venture whereby Old Merck acquired Astra&#146;s interest in KBI Inc. (&#147;KBI&#148;), and
contributed KBI&#146;s operating assets to a new U.S. limited partnership, Astra Pharmaceuticals L.P.
(the &#147;Partnership&#148;), in exchange for a 1% limited partner interest. Astra contributed the net
assets of its wholly owned subsidiary, Astra USA, Inc., to the Partnership in exchange for a 99%
general partner interest. The Partnership, renamed AstraZeneca LP (&#147;AZLP&#148;) upon Astra&#146;s 1999 merger
with Zeneca Group Plc (the &#147;AstraZeneca merger&#148;), became the exclusive distributor of the products
for which KBI retained rights.</TD>

    <TD width="1%">&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>As previously disclosed, in 1998, Astra purchased an option (the &#147;Asset Option&#148;) for a payment
of $443.0&nbsp;million, which was recorded as deferred income, to buy Old Merck&#146;s interest in the KBI
Inc. (&#147;KBI&#148;) products, excluding the gastrointestinal medicines Nexium and Prilosec (the &#147;Non-PPI
Products&#148;). On February&nbsp;26, 2010, AstraZeneca notified the Company that it was exercising the
Asset Option. Upon consummation of the exercise on April&nbsp;30, 2010, Merck received $647&nbsp;million
from AstraZeneca representing the net present value as of March&nbsp;31, 2008 of projected future
pretax revenue to be received by Old Merck from the Non-PPI Products. In addition, in 1998 Old Merck granted Astra an option
(the &#147;Shares Option&#148;) to buy Old Merck&#146;s common stock interest in KBI, and, therefore, Old Merck&#146;s
interest in Nexium and Prilosec, exercisable two years after Astra&#146;s exercise of the Asset Option.
Astra can also exercise the Shares Option in 2017 or if combined annual sales of the two products
fall below a minimum amount provided, in each case, only so long as AstraZeneca&#146;s Asset Option has
been exercised in 2010. The exercise price for the Shares Option is based on the net present value
of estimated future net sales of Nexium and Prilosec as determined at the time of exercise, subject
to certain true-up mechanisms.</TD>

to create an equally-owned partnership to develop and market in the United States new prescription

development costs and for co-promotion of approved products by each company. In 2001, the
cholesterol-management partnership was expanded to include all the countries of the world,
excluding Japan. In 2002, ezetimibe, the first in a new class of cholesterol-lowering agents, was
launched in the United States as <I>Zetia </I>(marketed as <I>Ezetrol </I>outside the United States). In 2004, a

    <TD>In 1997, Old Merck and Rh&#244;ne-Poulenc S.A. (now sanofi-aventis) combined their animal health
businesses to form Merial Limited (&#147;Merial&#148;), a fully integrated animal health company, which was a
stand-alone joint venture, 50% owned by each party. Merial provides a comprehensive range of
pharmaceuticals and vaccines to enhance the health, well-being and performance of a wide range of
animal species. In 2009, Old Merck sold its 50% interest in Merial to sanofi-aventis for $4
billion in cash.</TD>

    <TD>In connection with the sale of Merial, Old Merck, sanofi-aventis and Schering-Plough signed a
call option agreement which provided sanofi-aventis with an option to require the Company to
combine its Intervet/Schering-Plough Animal Health business with Merial to form an animal health
joint venture that would be owned equally by the Company and sanofi-aventis. In March&nbsp;2010,
sanofi-aventis exercised its option. As part of the call option agreement, the value of Merial has
been fixed at $8&nbsp;billion. The minimum total value to be received by the Company for contributing
Intervet/Schering-Plough to the combined entity would be $9.25&nbsp;billion (subject to customary
transaction adjustments), consisting of a floor valuation of Intervet/Schering-Plough which is
fixed at a minimum of $8.5&nbsp;billion (which was subject to potential upward revision based on a
valuation exercise by the two parties) and an additional payment by sanofi-aventis of $750&nbsp;million.
Based on the valuation exercise, the value of Intervet/Schering-Plough was determined to be $8.5
billion, leading to a future payment of $250&nbsp;million by sanofi-aventis to the Company to true-up the
value of the contributions so that they are equal pursuant to the terms of the agreement. All
payments, including adjustments for debt and certain other liabilities, will be made upon closing
of the transaction. The formation of this new animal health joint venture is subject to execution
of final agreements, antitrust review in the United States, Europe and other countries and other
customary closing conditions. On March&nbsp;30, 2010, the parties signed the contribution agreement
which obligates them, subject to regulatory approval, to form the joint venture. The Company
expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2011.</TD>

&#147;MDL&#148;) before District Judge Eldon E. Fallon. A number of such actions filed in state court are
coordinated in separate coordinated proceedings in state courts in New Jersey, California and
Texas, and the counties of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Washoe and Clark Counties, Nevada. As of
March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company had been served or was aware that it had been named as a defendant in
approximately 6,975 pending lawsuits, which include approximately 15,000 plaintiff groups, alleging
personal injuries resulting from the use of <I>Vioxx</I>, and in approximately 41 putative class actions
alleging personal injuries and/or economic loss. (All of the actions discussed in this paragraph
and in &#147;Other Lawsuits&#148; below are collectively referred to as the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability

court and in federal court in the MDL. On September&nbsp;15, 2009, Old Merck announced it had finalized
a settlement agreement, which it had previously disclosed, to resolve all pending lawsuits in which
U.S.-based private third-party payors (&#147;TPPs&#148;) sought reimbursement for covering <I>Vioxx </I>purchased by
their plan members. Certain other claimants participated in the resolution as well. The agreement
provided that Old Merck did not admit wrongdoing or fault. Under the settlement agreement, Old
Merck paid a fixed total of $80&nbsp;million. This amount includes a settlement fund that will be
divided among the TPPs (insurers, employee benefit plans and union welfare funds) participating in
the resolution in accordance with a formula that is based on product volume and a provision for
potential payment of attorneys&#146; fees. In return, the settling TPPs will dismiss their lawsuits and
release their claims against Old Merck. Stipulated dismissals of the settled TTP actions were filed
in New Jersey and the MDL in December&nbsp;2009. Old Merck recorded a charge of $80&nbsp;million in the
second quarter of 2009 related to the settlement and paid the $80&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of

    <TD>Judge Stanley R. Chesler for inclusion in a nationwide MDL (the &#147;Shareholder MDL&#148;). Judge
Chesler has consolidated the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits for all purposes. The putative class
action, which requested damages on behalf of purchasers of Old Merck stock between May&nbsp;21, 1999 and
October&nbsp;29, 2004, alleged that the defendants made false and misleading statements regarding <I>Vioxx</I>
in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and sought
unspecified compensatory damages and the costs of suit, including attorneys&#146; fees. The complaint
also asserted claims under Section&nbsp;20A of the Securities and Exchange Act against certain
defendants relating to their sales of Old Merck stock and under Sections&nbsp;11, 12 and 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933 against certain defendants based on statements in a registration statement
and certain prospectuses filed in connection with the Old Merck Stock Investment Plan, a dividend
reinvestment plan. On April&nbsp;12, 2007, Judge Chesler granted defendants&#146; motion to dismiss the
complaint with prejudice. Plaintiffs appealed Judge Chesler&#146;s decision to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit. On September&nbsp;9, 2008, the Third Circuit issued an opinion reversing
Judge Chesler&#146;s order and remanding the case to the District Court. Old Merck filed a petition for
a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court on January&nbsp;15, 2009, which the Supreme
Court granted on May&nbsp;26, 2009. While the petition for certiorari was pending, plaintiffs filed
their Consolidated and Fifth Amended Class&nbsp;Action Complaint in the District Court. Old Merck filed
a motion to dismiss that complaint on May&nbsp;1, 2009, following which the District Court proceedings
were stayed pending the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal. On September&nbsp;16, 2009, Old Merck
withdrew its motion to dismiss in the District Court without prejudice to its right to re-file such
a motion pending the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal. On November&nbsp;30, 2009, the Supreme Court
heard oral argument. On April&nbsp;27, 2010, the Supreme Court affirmed the Third Circuit&#146;s order
reversing the District Court&#146;s dismissal of the then-operative
complaint. The case is being returned to the District Court for further proceedings. Old Merck has stated its intention to renew its
motion to dismiss the Fifth Amended Class&nbsp;Action Complaint.</TD>

    <TD>In October&nbsp;2005, a Dutch pension fund filed a complaint in the District of New Jersey alleging
violations of federal securities laws as well as violations of state law against Old Merck and
certain officers. Pursuant to the Case Management Order governing the Shareholder MDL, the case,
which is based on the same allegations as the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits, was consolidated with the
<I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits. Defendants&#146; motion to dismiss the pension fund&#146;s complaint was filed on
August&nbsp;3, 2007. In September&nbsp;2007, the Dutch pension fund filed an amended complaint rather than
responding to defendants&#146; motion to dismiss. In addition, in 2007, six new complaints were filed
in the District of New Jersey on behalf of various foreign institutional investors also alleging
violations of federal securities laws as well as violations of state law against Old Merck and
certain officers. By stipulation, defendants are not required to respond to these complaints until
the resolution of any motion to dismiss in the consolidated securities action.</TD>

    <TD>In addition, as previously disclosed, various putative class actions filed in federal court
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#147;ERISA&#148;) against Old Merck and certain current
and former officers and directors (the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>ERISA Lawsuits&#148; and, together with the <I>Vioxx</I>
Securities Lawsuits and the <I>Vioxx </I>Derivative Lawsuits described below, the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Shareholder
Lawsuits&#148;) have been transferred to the Shareholder MDL and consolidated for all purposes. The
consolidated complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty on behalf of certain of Old
Merck&#146;s current and former employees who are participants in certain of Old Merck&#146;s retirement
plans. The complaint makes similar allegations with respect to <I>Vioxx </I>to the allegations contained
in the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits. On July&nbsp;11, 2006, Judge Chesler granted in part and denied in
part defendants&#146; motion to dismiss the ERISA complaint. On October&nbsp;19, 2007, plaintiffs moved for
certification of a class of individuals who were participants in and beneficiaries of Old Merck&#146;s
retirement savings plans at any time between October&nbsp;1, 1998 and September&nbsp;30, 2004 and whose plan
accounts included investments in the Old Merck Common Stock Fund and/or Old Merck common stock. On
February&nbsp;9, 2009, the court denied the motion for certification of a class as to one count and
granted the motion as to the remaining counts. The court also excluded from the class definition
those individuals who (i)&nbsp;were not injured in connection with their investments in Old Merck stock
and (ii)&nbsp;executed post-separation settlement agreements that released their claims under ERISA. On
March&nbsp;23, 2009, Judge Chesler denied defendants&#146; motion for judgment on the pleadings. On May&nbsp;11,
2009, Judge Chesler entered an order denying plaintiffs&#146; motion for partial summary judgment
against certain individual defendants, which had been filed on December&nbsp;24, 2008. Discovery in the
<I>Vioxx </I>ERISA Lawsuits is ongoing.</TD>

    <TD>As previously disclosed, on October&nbsp;29, 2004, two individual shareholders made a demand on Old
Merck&#146;s Board to take legal action against Mr.&nbsp;Raymond Gilmartin, former Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer, and other individuals for allegedly causing damage to Old Merck with
respect to the allegedly improper marketing of <I>Vioxx</I>. In December&nbsp;2004, the Special Committee of
the Board of Directors retained the Honorable John S. Martin, Jr. of Debevoise &#038; Plimpton LLP to
conduct an independent investigation of, among other things, the allegations set forth in the
demand. Judge Martin&#146;s report was made public in September&nbsp;2006. Based on the Special Committee&#146;s
recommendation made after careful consideration of the Martin report and the impact that derivative
litigation would have on Old Merck, the Board rejected the demand. On October&nbsp;11, 2007, two
shareholders filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit purportedly on Old Merck&#146;s behalf in state
court in Atlantic County, New Jersey against current and former officers and directors of Old
Merck. Plaintiffs alleged that the Board&#146;s rejection of their demand was unreasonable and
improper, and that the defendants breached various duties to Old Merck in allowing <I>Vioxx </I>to be
marketed. The parties reached a proposed settlement and, on February&nbsp;8, 2010, the court issued an
order preliminarily approving the settlement, requiring that notice of the proposed settlement be
made to Merck&#146;s shareholders, and setting a hearing to consider final approval of the settlement on
March&nbsp;22, 2010. On February&nbsp;9, 2010, Merck notified shareholders of the proposed settlement and
its terms. On March&nbsp;22, 2010, the court orally approved the settlement but reserved judgment on
plaintiffs&#146; request for attorneys&#146; fees. On April&nbsp;15, 2010, the court issued an order approving
the settlement and awarding to plaintiffs&#146; attorneys fees and expenses totaling $9,219,460. Under

    <TD>As previously disclosed, various shareholder derivative actions filed in federal court were
transferred to the Shareholder MDL and consolidated for all purposes by Judge Chesler (the &#147;<I>Vioxx</I>
Derivative Lawsuits&#148;). On May&nbsp;5, 2006, Judge Chesler granted defendants&#146; motion to dismiss on the
grounds that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that demand should be excused and denied
plaintiffs&#146; request for leave to amend their complaint. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing that Judge
Chesler erred in denying plaintiffs&#146; leave to amend their complaint with documents acquired by
stipulation of the parties. On July&nbsp;18, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit reversed the District Court&#146;s decision on the grounds that Judge Chesler should have
allowed plaintiffs to seek leave to amend their complaint using the documents acquired by
stipulation, and remanded the case for the District Court&#146;s consideration of whether, even with the
additional materials, plaintiffs&#146; proposed amendment would be futile. Plaintiffs filed their brief
in support of their request for leave to amend their complaint, along with their proposed amended
complaint, on November&nbsp;9, 2007. The Court denied the motion on June&nbsp;17, 2008, and again dismissed
the case. One of the plaintiffs appealed Judge Chesler&#146;s decision to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit. Oral argument on the appeal was held on July&nbsp;15, 2009. On November
10, 2009, before any decision was issued, the appeal was stayed pending the settlement reached in
the derivative action pending in the New Jersey Superior Court. As discussed above, the settlement
was approved on April&nbsp;15, 2010, and resolves all shareholder derivative litigation relating to
<I>Vioxx</I>. Under the terms of the settlement, the Third Circuit appeal will be voluntarily dismissed.</TD>

    <TD>In November&nbsp;2006, the Superior Court in Quebec authorized the institution of a class action on
behalf of all individuals who, in Quebec, consumed <I>Vioxx </I>and suffered damages arising out of its
ingestion. On May&nbsp;7, 2009, the plaintiffs served an introductory motion for a class action based
upon that authorization, and the case remains in preliminary stages of litigation. On May&nbsp;30,
2008, the provincial court of Queen&#146;s Bench in Saskatchewan, Canada entered an order certifying a
class of <I>Vioxx </I>users in Canada, except those in Quebec. Old Merck appealed the certification order
and, on March&nbsp;30, 2009, the Court of Appeal granted Old Merck&#146;s appeal and quashed the
certification order. On October&nbsp;22, 2009, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed plaintiffs&#146; appeal
application and decided not to review the judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. On July
28, 2008, the Superior Court in Ontario denied Old Merck&#146;s motion to stay class proceedings in
Ontario and decided to certify an overlapping class of <I>Vioxx </I>users in Canada, except those in
Quebec and Saskatchewan, who allege negligence and an entitlement to elect to waive the tort. On
February&nbsp;13, 2009, the Ontario Divisional Court dismissed the appeal from the order denying the
stay and, on May&nbsp;15, 2009, the Ontario Court of Appeal denied leave to appeal. On October&nbsp;22,
2009, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed Old Merck&#146;s application and decided not to review the
judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal. After the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan quashed the
multi-jurisdictional certification order entered in that province, Old Merck applied to the Ontario
Court of Appeal for leave to appeal from the Ontario certification order. Leave to appeal was
granted, the appeal was filed on May&nbsp;20, 2009 and, in accordance with the court&#146;s decision, Old
Merck sought leave to appeal to the Divisional Court, which was denied on December&nbsp;7, 2009. These
procedural decisions in the Canadian litigation do not address the merits of the plaintiffs&#146; claims
and litigation in Canada remains in an early stage.</TD>

    <TD>A trial in a representative action in Australia concluded on June&nbsp;25, 2009, in the Federal
Court of Australia. The named plaintiff, who alleged he suffered an MI, seeks to represent others
in Australia who ingested <I>Vioxx </I>and suffered an MI, thrombotic stroke, unstable angina, transient
ischemic attack or peripheral vascular disease. On March&nbsp;30, 2009, the trial judge entered an
order directing that, in advance of all other issues in the proceeding, the issues to be determined
during the trial were those issues of fact and law in the named plaintiff&#146;s individual case, and
those issues of fact and law that the trial judge finds, after hearing the evidence, are common to
the claims of the group members that the named plaintiff has alleged that he represents. On March
5, 2010, the trial judge delivered his judgment. The court decided to dismiss all claims against
Old Merck, specifically finding that Old Merck had done everything that might reasonably be
expected of it in the discharge of its duty of care. With regard to Old Merck&#146;s Australian
subsidiary, Merck Sharp &#038; Dohme (Australia) Pty Ltd, the court decided to dismiss certain claims
but to award the named plaintiff, whom the court found suffered an MI after ingesting <I>Vioxx </I>for
approximately 33&nbsp;months, compensation based on statutory claims that <I>Vioxx </I>was not fit for purpose
or of merchantable quality, even though the Court rejected the applicant&#146;s claim that Old Merck and
its Australian subsidiary knew or ought to have known prior to the voluntary withdrawal of <I>Vioxx </I>in
September&nbsp;2004 that <I>Vioxx </I>materially increased the risk of MI. On May&nbsp;7, 2010, the court will
conduct a hearing to determine the orders to be entered giving effect to the judgment, in which the
court will determine which of its findings of fact and law are common to the claims of other group
members and will consider any other motions that might be brought. Old Merck&#146;s subsidiary intends
to appeal the adverse findings after the orders have been entered.</TD>

    <TD>Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued

    <TD>During the first quarter of 2010, Merck spent approximately $42&nbsp;million in the aggregate in
legal defense costs worldwide, related to (i)&nbsp;the <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits, (ii)&nbsp;the <I>Vioxx</I>
Shareholder Lawsuits, (iii)&nbsp;the <I>Vioxx </I>Foreign Lawsuits, and (iv)&nbsp;the <I>Vioxx </I>Investigations
(collectively, the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Litigation&#148;). In addition, during the first quarter of 2010, Merck
recorded a $30&nbsp;million charge solely for its future legal defense costs for the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation.
Consequently, as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, the aggregate amount of the <I>Vioxx </I>Reserve was approximately $98
million, which is solely for future legal defense costs for the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation. Some of the
significant factors considered in the review of the <I>Vioxx </I>Reserve were as follows: the actual costs
incurred by the Company; the development of the Company&#146;s legal defense strategy and structure in
light of the scope of the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation, including the Settlement Agreement and the expectation
that certain lawsuits will continue to be pending; the number of cases being brought against the
Company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding
anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the <I>Vioxx</I>
Litigation. The amount of the <I>Vioxx </I>Reserve as of March&nbsp;31, 2010 represents the Company&#146;s best
estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with the remaining
aspects of the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation; however, events such as additional trials in the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation
and other events that could arise in the course of the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation could affect the ultimate
amount of defense costs to be incurred by the Company.</TD>

    <TD>As previously disclosed, Old Merck is a defendant in product liability lawsuits in the United
States involving <I>Fosamax </I>(the &#147;<I>Fosamax </I>Litigation&#148;). As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, approximately 1,039
cases, which include approximately 1,417 plaintiff groups, had been filed and were pending against
Old Merck in either federal or state court, including one case which seeks class action
certification, as well as damages and/or medical monitoring. In these actions, plaintiffs allege,
among other things, that they have suffered osteonecrosis of the jaw, generally subsequent to
invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction or dental implants and/or delayed healing, in
association with the use of <I>Fosamax</I>. In addition, plaintiffs in approximately seven percent of
these actions allege that they sustained stress and/or low energy femoral fractures in association
with the use of <I>Fosamax</I>. On August&nbsp;16, 2006, the JPML ordered that certain <I>Fosamax </I>product
liability cases pending in federal courts nationwide should be transferred and consolidated into
one multidistrict litigation (the &#147;<I>Fosamax </I>MDL&#148;) for coordinated pre-trial proceedings. The
<I>Fosamax </I>MDL has been transferred to Judge John Keenan in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York. As a result of the JPML order, approximately 799 of the cases are before
Judge Keenan. Judge Keenan issued a Case Management Order (and various amendments thereto) setting
forth a schedule governing the proceedings which focused primarily upon resolving the class action
certification motions in 2007 and completing fact discovery in an initial group of 25 cases by
October&nbsp;1, 2008. Briefing and argument on plaintiffs&#146; motions for certification of medical
monitoring classes were completed in 2007 and Judge Keenan issued an order denying the motions on
January&nbsp;3, 2008. On January&nbsp;28, 2008, Judge Keenan issued a further order dismissing with
prejudice all class claims asserted in the first four class action lawsuits filed against Old Merck
that sought personal injury damages and/or medical monitoring relief on a class wide basis. <I>Daubert</I>
motions were filed in May&nbsp;2009 and Judge Keenan conducted a <I>Daubert </I>hearing in July&nbsp;2009. On July
27, 2009, Judge Keenan issued his ruling on the parties&#146; respective <I>Daubert </I>motions. The ruling
denied the Plaintiff Steering Committee&#146;s motion and granted in part and denied in part Old Merck&#146;s
motion. The first MDL trial &#151; <I>Boles v. Merck </I>&#151; began on August&nbsp;11, 2009, and ended on September
2, 2009. On September&nbsp;11, 2009, the MDL court declared a mistrial in <I>Boles </I>because the eight
person jury could not reach a unanimous verdict and, consequently, the <I>Boles </I>case is set to be
retried on June&nbsp;2, 2010. The second MDL case set for trial &#151; <I>Flemings v. Merck </I>&#151; was scheduled to
start on January&nbsp;12, 2010, but Judge Keenan granted Old Merck&#146;s motion for summary judgment and
dismissed the case on November&nbsp;23, 2009. In the next MDL case set for trial &#151; <I>Maley v. Merck </I>&#151;
the trial commenced on April&nbsp;12, 2010 and went to the jury on
May 5, 2010. On the same day, the jury returned a unanimous verdict in Merck&#146;s favor. Old Merck filed a motion for summary judgment in
<I>Maley</I>, which the MDL court granted in part and denied in part on January&nbsp;27, 2010. On February&nbsp;1,
2010, Judge Keenan selected a new bellwether case &#151; <I>Judith Graves v. Merck </I>&#151; to replace the
<I>Flemings </I>bellwether case, which the MDL court dismissed when it granted summary judgment in favor
of Old Merck. The MDL court has set the <I>Graves </I>trial to begin on September&nbsp;13, 2010. A trial in
Alabama was scheduled to begin on May&nbsp;3, 2010 but the trial court granted the parties&#146; joint motion
to postpone the trial date until the fall of 2010. A trial in Florida was scheduled to begin on
June&nbsp;21, 2010 but on April&nbsp;7, 2010 the Florida state court postponed the trial date until sometime
after January&nbsp;1, 2011.</TD>

    <TD>In addition, in July&nbsp;2008, an application was made by the Atlantic County Superior Court of
New Jersey requesting that all of the <I>Fosamax </I>cases pending in New Jersey be considered for mass
tort designation and centralized management before one judge in New Jersey. On October&nbsp;6, 2008,
the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered that all pending and future actions filed in New Jersey
arising out of the use of <I>Fosamax </I>and seeking damages for existing dental and jaw-related injuries,
including osteonecrosis of the jaw, but not solely seeking medical monitoring, be designated as a
mass tort for centralized management purposes before Judge Higbee in Atlantic County Superior
Court. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, approximately 219 cases were pending against Old Merck in the New
Jersey coordinated proceeding. On July&nbsp;20, 2009, Judge Higbee entered a Case Management Order (and
various amendments thereto) setting forth a schedule that contemplates completing fact discovery in
an initial group of 10 cases by March&nbsp;31, 2010, followed by expert discovery in four of those
cases, and a projected trial date of July&nbsp;12, 2010 for the first case to be tried in the New Jersey
coordinated proceeding. On April&nbsp;15, 2010, however, Judge Higbee advised that the first <I>Fosamax</I>
trial in the New Jersey coordinated proceeding will not occur until the fall of 2010 and set a
tentative trial date of September&nbsp;27, 2010.</TD>

    <TD>As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company had a remaining reserve of approximately $38&nbsp;million
solely for its future legal defense costs for the <I>Fosamax </I>Litigation. During the first quarter of
2010, the Company spent approximately $6&nbsp;million and added $20&nbsp;million to its reserve.
Consequently, as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company had a reserve of approximately $52&nbsp;million solely
for its future legal defense costs for the <I>Fosamax </I>Litigation. Some of the significant factors
considered in the establishment of the reserve for the <I>Fosamax </I>Litigation legal defense costs were
as follows: the actual defense costs incurred thus far; the development of the Company&#146;s legal
defense strategy and structure in light of the creation of the <I>Fosamax </I>MDL; the number of cases
being brought against the Company; and the anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of
pre-trial activities in the <I>Fosamax </I>Litigation. The Company will continue to monitor its legal
defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves. Due to the uncertain nature of
litigation, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate its costs beyond the second quarter of
2011. The Company has not established any reserves for any potential liability relating to the
<I>Fosamax </I>Litigation. Unfavorable outcomes in the <I>Fosamax </I>Litigation could have a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s financial position, liquidity and results of operations.</TD>

claims against the Company&#146;s subsidiaries Organon USA, Inc., Organon Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.,
Organon International (collectively, &#147;Organon&#148;), and the Company arising from Organon&#146;s marketing
and sale of <I>NuvaRing</I>, a combined hormonal contraceptive ring. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, there were
approximately 500 <I>NuvaRing </I>cases. Of these cases, 393 are pending in a multidistrict litigation
(the &#147;<I>NuvaRing </I>MDL&#148;) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri before Judge
Rodney Sippel, and approximately 100 are pending in consolidated discovery proceedings in the

class action lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In that
lawsuit, entitled <I>Friedman v. Schering-Plough Animal Health</I>, the individual plaintiff seeks to
represent a class of people who purchased <I>Vetsulin </I>for their household pets and the suit alleges
that <I>Vetsulin </I>was contaminated or improperly manufactured. <I>Vetsulin </I>is an insulin product
administered to diabetic dogs and cats. Plaintiff originally sought compensatory and punitive
damages based on theories of negligence, violation of consumer sales practices acts, breach of
warranty, and product liability due to allegedly defective manufacturing. On March&nbsp;1, 2010,
plaintiff filed an amended complaint limiting plaintiff&#146;s theories of recovery to alleged statutory
violations of Ohio and New Jersey laws. Merck intends to defend against this lawsuit.</TD>

    <TD>As previously disclosed, Old Merck was joined in ongoing litigation alleging manipulation by
pharmaceutical manufacturers of Average Wholesale Prices (&#147;AWP&#148;), which are sometimes used in
calculations that determine public and private sector reimbursement levels. The complaints allege
violations of federal and state law, including fraud, Medicaid fraud and consumer protection
violations, among other claims. The outcome of these litigations and investigations could include
substantial damages, the imposition of substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or
administrative remedies. In 2002, the JPML ordered the transfer and consolidation of all pending
federal AWP cases to federal court in Boston, Massachusetts. Plaintiffs filed one consolidated
class action complaint, which aggregated the claims previously filed in various federal district
court actions and also expanded the number of manufacturers to include some which, like Old Merck,
had not been defendants in any prior pending case. In May&nbsp;2003, the court granted Old Merck&#146;s
motion to dismiss the consolidated class action and dismissed Old Merck from the class action case.
Old Merck and many other pharmaceutical manufacturers are defendants in similar complaints pending
in federal and state court including cases brought individually by a number of counties in the
State of New York. Fifty of the county cases have been consolidated in New York state court. Old
Merck was dismissed from the Suffolk County case, which was the first of the New York county cases
to be filed. In addition to the New York county cases, as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, Old Merck was a
defendant in state cases brought by the Attorneys General of eleven states, all of which are being
defended. In February&nbsp;2009, the Kansas Attorney General filed suit against Old Merck and several
other manufacturers. AWP claims brought by the Attorney General of Arizona against Old Merck were
dropped in 2009. The court in the AWP cases pending in Hawaii listed Old Merck and others to be
set for trial in August 2010.</TD>

    <TD>In 2009, Schering-Plough reached settlements of certain claims relating to AWP. In August&nbsp;2009,
Schering-Plough and five other pharmaceutical companies settled all claims brought on behalf of the
Alabama Medicaid program for a combined total of $89&nbsp;million. In addition, in July&nbsp;2009,
Schering-Plough reached a settlement with the Relator, acting on behalf of the United States in a
non-intervened AWP <I>qui tam </I>action pending in the U.S. Federal District Court of Massachusetts and
with the States of California and Florida for a combined total of $69&nbsp;million. That settlement
resolved all claims brought on behalf of the Medicaid programs for the States of California and
Florida and has been approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts and held
to be preclusive of all claims for the federal share of any alleged Medicaid overpayment in all
remaining states consistent with applicable precedent. In January&nbsp;2010, the U.S. District Court
for the District of Massachusetts held that a unit of Schering-Plough and eight other drugmakers
overcharged New York City and 42 New York counties for certain generic drugs. The court has
reserved the issue of damages and any penalties for future proceedings.</TD>

    <TD>Also, as previously disclosed, on April&nbsp;3, 2008, an Old Merck shareholder filed a putative
class action lawsuit in federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging that Old
Merck and its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Richard T. Clark, violated the
federal securities laws. This suit has since been withdrawn and re-filed in the District of New
Jersey and has been consolidated with another federal securities lawsuit under the caption <I>In re

October&nbsp;6, 2008, and names as defendants Old Merck; Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals, LLC; and
certain of the Company&#146;s current and former officers and directors. Specifically, the complaint
alleges that Old Merck delayed releasing unfavorable results of the ENHANCE clinical trial
regarding the efficacy of <I>Vytorin </I>and that Old Merck made false and misleading statements about
expected earnings, knowing that once the results of the <I>Vytorin </I>study were released, sales of

    <TD>As previously disclosed, on April&nbsp;22, 2008, a member of an Old Merck ERISA plan filed a
putative class action lawsuit against Old Merck and certain of the Company&#146;s current and former
officers and directors alleging they breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA. Since that time,
there have been other similar ERISA lawsuits filed against Old Merck in the District of New Jersey,

ERISA Litigation</I>. A consolidated amended complaint was filed on February&nbsp;5, 2009, and names as
defendants Old Merck and various current and former members of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors.
The plaintiffs allege that the ERISA plans&#146; investment in Old Merck stock was imprudent because Old
Merck&#146;s earnings are dependent on the commercial success of its cholesterol drug <I>Vytorin </I>and that
defendants knew or should have known that the results of a scientific study would cause the medical
community to turn to less expensive drugs for cholesterol management. On April&nbsp;23, 2009, Old Merck

    <TD>Following Schering-Plough&#146;s announcement on February&nbsp;15, 2001 that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) had been conducting inspections of its manufacturing facilities in New
Jersey and Puerto Rico and had issued reports citing deficiencies concerning compliance with
current Good Manufacturing Practices, and had delayed approval of <I>Clarinex</I>, several lawsuits were
filed against Schering-Plough and certain named officers. These lawsuits allege that the
defendants violated the federal securities law by allegedly failing to disclose material
information and making material misstatements. Specifically, they allege that Schering-Plough
failed to disclose an alleged serious risk that a new drug application for <I>Clarinex </I>would be
delayed as a result of these manufacturing issues, and they allege that the Company failed to
disclose the alleged depth and severity of its manufacturing issues. These complaints were

shareholders who purchased shares of Schering-Plough stock from May&nbsp;9, 2000 through February&nbsp;15,

    <TD>On March&nbsp;31, 2003, Schering-Plough was served with a putative class action complaint filed in
the U.S. District Court in New Jersey alleging that Schering-Plough, its Employee Savings Plan (the
&#147;Plan&#148;) administrator, several current and former directors, and certain former corporate officers
breached their fiduciary obligations to certain participants in the Plan. The complaint seeks
damages in the amount of losses allegedly suffered by the Plan. The complaint was dismissed on
June&nbsp;29, 2004. The plaintiffs appealed. On August&nbsp;19, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit reversed the dismissal by the District Court and the matter has been remanded back to
the District Court for further proceedings. On September&nbsp;30, 2008, the District Court entered an
order granting in part, and denying in part, the named putative class representative&#146;s motion for
class certification. Schering-Plough thereafter petitioned the U.S. District Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit for leave to appeal the class certification decision. Schering-Plough&#146;s petition
was granted on December&nbsp;10, 2008. On December&nbsp;21, 2009, the Third Circuit vacated the District

    <TD>In June&nbsp;1997 and January&nbsp;1998, Schering-Plough settled patent litigation with Upsher-Smith,
Inc. (&#147;Upsher-Smith&#148;) and ESI Lederle, Inc. (&#147;Lederle&#148;), respectively, relating to generic versions
of K-DUR, Schering-Plough&#146;s long-acting potassium chloride product supplement used by cardiac
patients, for which Lederle and Upsher-Smith had filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications
(&#147;ANDA&#146;s&#148;). Following the commencement of an administrative proceeding by the United States
Federal Trade Commission (the &#147;FTC&#148;) alleging anti-competitive effects from those settlements
(which has been resolved in Schering-Plough&#146;s favor), alleged class action suits were filed in
federal and state courts on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of K-DUR against
Schering-Plough, Upsher-Smith and Lederle. These suits claim violations of federal and state
antitrust laws, as well as other state statutory and common law causes of action. These suits seek
unspecified damages. In February&nbsp;2009, a special master recommended that the U.S. District Court
for the District of New Jersey dismiss the class action lawsuits on summary judgment and in March
2010, the District Court adopted the recommendation, granted summary judgment to the defendants,
and dismissed the matter in its entirety. In April&nbsp;2010, plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with

    <TD>As previously disclosed, Old Merck is a party to individual and class action product liability
lawsuits and claims in the United States involving pediatric vaccines (e.g., hepatitis B vaccine)
that contained thimerosal, a preservative used in vaccines. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, there were
approximately 200 thimerosal related lawsuits pending in which Old Merck is a defendant, although
the vast majority of those lawsuits are not currently active. Other defendants include other
vaccine manufacturers who produced pediatric vaccines containing thimerosal as well as
manufacturers of thimerosal. In these actions, the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that
they have suffered neurological injuries as a result of exposure to thimerosal from pediatric
vaccines. There are no cases currently scheduled for trial. The Company will defend against these

    <TD>Old Merck has been successful in having cases of this type either dismissed or stayed on the
ground that the action is prohibited under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (the &#147;Vaccine
Act&#148;). The Vaccine Act prohibits any person from filing or maintaining a civil action (in state or
federal court) seeking damages against a vaccine manufacturer for vaccine-related injuries unless a
petition is first filed in the United States Court of Federal Claims (hereinafter the &#147;Vaccine
Court&#148;). Under the Vaccine Act, before filing a civil action against a vaccine manufacturer, the
petitioner must either (a)&nbsp;pursue his or her petition to conclusion in Vaccine Court and then
timely file an election to proceed with a civil action in lieu of accepting the Vaccine Court&#146;s
adjudication of the petition or (b)&nbsp;timely exercise a right to withdraw the petition prior to
Vaccine Court adjudication in accordance with certain statutorily prescribed time periods. Old

    <TD>The Company is aware that there are approximately 5,000 cases pending in the Vaccine Court
involving allegations that thimerosal-containing vaccines and/or the <I>M-M-R </I>II vaccine cause autism
spectrum disorders. Not all of the thimerosal-containing vaccines involved in the Vaccine Court
proceeding are Company vaccines. The Company is the sole source of the <I>M-M-R </I>II vaccine
domestically. The Special Masters presiding over the Vaccine Court proceedings held hearings in
three test cases involving the theory that the combination of <I>M-M-R </I>II vaccine and thimerosal in

Two of those three cases are currently on appeal. The Special Masters held similar hearings in
three different test cases involving the theory that thimerosal in vaccines alone causes autism

    <TD>From time to time, generic manufacturers of pharmaceutical products file ANDA&#146;s with the FDA

<I>Atripla, </I>respectively<I>, </I>prior to the expiration of Old Merck&#146;s (and AstraZeneca&#146;s in the case of
Nexium) patents concerning these products. In addition, an ANDA has been submitted to the FDA
seeking to market in the United States a generic form of <I>Zetia </I>and an ANDA has been submitted to
the FDA seeking to market in the United States a generic form of <I>Vytorin</I>, both prior to the
expiration of Schering-Plough&#146;s patent concerning those products. The generic companies&#146; ANDA&#146;s
generally include allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of the patents.
The Company has filed patent infringement suits in federal court against companies filing ANDA&#146;s
for generic montelukast (<I>Singulair</I>), aprepitant (<I>Emend</I>) and caspofungin

ANDA&#146;s for generic versions of ezetimibe (<I>Zetia</I>) and ezetimibe/simvastatin (<I>Vytorin</I>). Also,
Schering Corp. (&#147;Schering&#148;), a subsidiary of the Company, has filed patent infringement suits in

Bristol-Myers Squibb (&#147;BMS&#148;) and the Company have filed a patent infringement lawsuit against a
generic company for filing an ANDA for generic <I>Atripla</I>. The Company intends to defend
its patents, which it believes are valid, against infringement by generic companies attempting to
market products prior to the expiration dates of such patents. As with any litigation, there can

    <TD>In July&nbsp;2007, Schering and its licensor, Cancer Research Technologies, Limited (&#147;CRT&#148;),
received notice from Barr Laboratories (&#147;Barr&#148;) (now a subsidiary of Teva) that Barr had filed an
ANDA for <I>Temodar </I>and that it was challenging CRT&#146;s patent for temozolomide. In July&nbsp;2007, Schering
and CRT filed a patent infringement action against Barr. In January&nbsp;2010, the court issued a
decision finding the CRT patent unenforceable on grounds of prosecution laches and inequitable
conduct. Schering and CRT are in the process of appealing the decision. In March&nbsp;2010, CRT,
Schering and Barr entered into an agreement under which Barr agreed not to launch a generic
temozolomide pending a decision from the Court of Appeals. In any event, under the agreement, Barr
will be permitted to launch a generic product during the six month pediatric extension period in
August&nbsp;2013.</TD>

federal action, which was brought against Schering-Plough and its directors. Objectors to that

    <TD>Based on a complaint to the French competition authority from a competitor in France and
pursuant to a court order, the French competition authority has obtained documents from a French
subsidiary of the Company relating to <I>Subutex</I>, one of the products that the subsidiary markets and
sells. Any resolution of this matter adverse to the French subsidiary could result in the
imposition of civil fines and injunctive or administrative remedies. On July&nbsp;17, 2007, the Juge
des Libert&#233;s et de la D&#233;tention ordered the annulment of the search and seizure on procedural
grounds. On July&nbsp;19, 2007, the French authority appealed the order to the French Supreme Court.
On May&nbsp;20, 2009, the French Supreme Court overturned that annulment and remanded the case to the
Paris Court of Appeal on the basis that the Juge des Libert&#233;s et de la D&#233;tention had not examined
each document to assess whether it should have been seized and whether it had been lawfully seized.
On March&nbsp;4, 2010, the Paris Court of Appeal confirmed the validity of the seizure&#146;s operations.
On March&nbsp;10, 2010, Schering-Plough S.A.S. lodged an appeal before the Supreme Court.</TD>

compared with the first quarter of 2009 is primarily due to the inclusion of costs associated with
Schering-Plough benefit plans as a result of the Merger. In connection with restructuring actions
(see Note 3), termination charges for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 were recorded
on pension and other postretirement benefit plans related to expanded eligibility for certain
employees exiting Merck. Also, in connection with these restructuring actions, curtailments were
recorded on pension plans for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 and on other
postretirement benefit plans for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009. In addition, settlements
were recorded on pension plans for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009.</TD>

    <TD>The decline in interest income and increase in interest expense in the first quarter of 2010
as compared with the first quarter of 2009 is largely attributable to the financing of the Merger.
In addition, during the first quarter of 2010, the Company recognized higher exchange losses of $80
million due to the Venezuelan currency devaluation. Effective January&nbsp;11, 2010, the Venezuelan
government devalued its currency from at BsF 2.15 per U.S. dollar to a two-tiered official exchange
rate at (1) &#147;the essentials rate&#148; at BsF 2.60 per U.S. dollar and (2) &#147;the non-essentials rate&#148; at
BsF 4.30 per U.S. dollar. The Company anticipates that its transactions will be settled at the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">The effective tax rate of 46.4% for the first quarter of 2010 reflects the impact of a charge
of $146.5&nbsp;million, or approximately 24&nbsp;percentage points, associated with a change in tax law that
requires taxation of the prescription drug subsidy of the Company&#146;s retiree health benefit plans
which was enacted in the first quarter of 2010 as part of U.S. health care reform legislation, as
well by the impacts of purchase accounting adjustments and restructuring charges. The effective
tax rate of 18.4% for the first quarter of 2009 reflects a favorable impact of approximately 5
percentage points resulting from the previously disclosed settlement reached with the Canada
Revenue Agency (&#147;CRA&#148;) and restructuring charges.

    <TD>As previously disclosed, in October&nbsp;2006, the CRA issued Old Merck a notice of reassessment
containing adjustments related to certain intercompany pricing matters. In February&nbsp;2009, Old
Merck and the CRA negotiated a settlement agreement in regard to these matters. In accordance with
the settlement, Old Merck paid an additional tax of approximately $300&nbsp;million (U.S. dollars) and
interest of approximately $360&nbsp;million (U.S. dollars) with no additional amounts or penalties due
on this assessment. The settlement was accounted for in the first quarter of 2009. Old Merck had
previously established reserves for these matters. A significant portion of the taxes paid is
expected to be creditable for U.S. tax purposes. The resolution of these matters did not have a
material effect on Old Merck&#146;s financial position or liquidity, other than with respect to the
associated collateral as discussed below.</TD>

    <TD>In addition, in July&nbsp;2007 and November&nbsp;2008, the CRA proposed additional adjustments for 1999
and 2000, respectively, relating to other intercompany pricing matters. The adjustments would
increase Canadian tax due by approximately $318&nbsp;million (U.S. dollars) plus approximately $328
million (U.S. dollars) of interest through March&nbsp;31, 2010. It is possible that the CRA will
propose similar adjustments for later years. The Company disagrees with the positions taken by the
CRA and believes they are without merit. The Company intends to contest the assessments through
the CRA appeals process and the courts if necessary. Management believes that resolution of these
matters will not have a material effect on the Company&#146;s financial position or liquidity.</TD>

were reduced or eliminated and a portion of associated collateral was released. Certain of the

    <TD>In October&nbsp;2001, Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) auditors asserted that two interest rate
swaps that Schering-Plough entered into with an unrelated party should be re-characterized as loans
from affiliated companies, resulting in additional tax liability for the 1991 and 1992 tax years.
In September&nbsp;2004, Schering-Plough made payments to the IRS in the amount of $194&nbsp;million for
income taxes and $279&nbsp;million for interest. Schering-Plough filed refund claims for the taxes and
interest with the IRS in December&nbsp;2004. Following the IRS&#146;s denial of Schering-Plough&#146;s claims for
a refund, Schering-Plough filed suit in May&nbsp;2005 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New
Jersey for refund of the full amount of tax and interest. Schering-Plough&#146;s tax reserves were
adequate to cover the above mentioned payments. A decision in favor of the government was
announced in August&nbsp;2009. Schering-Plough filed a motion for a retrial, which was denied on April
28, 2010, and therefore the Company intends to file an appeal to the 3rd circuit.</TD>

    <TD>The IRS has issued Merck a Revenue Agent&#146;s Report (&#147;RAR&#148;) dated April&nbsp;19, 2010 pertaining to
the former Schering-Plough for the years 2003 to 2006. The proposed adjustments to income
contained in the report amount to approximately $1&nbsp;billion and relate to certain intercompany
pricing matters. The Company vigorously disagrees with the proposed adjustments and believes they
are without merit. The tax that would be assessed as a result of the RAR as stated would
approximate $370&nbsp;million and would mostly reduce net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;) and other tax credit
carryforwards. The Company believes that the resolution of this matter will not have a material
impact to its results of operations. The Company intends to pursue all
administrative remedies available to it, including the IRS appeals process and the courts if

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">The Company calculates earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method, which is an
earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for common stock and participating
securities according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings.
Under this method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common shares and
participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. RSUs and certain
PSUs granted before December&nbsp;31, 2009 to certain management level employees participate in
dividends on the same basis as common shares and are nonforfeitable by the holder. As a result,
these RSUs and PSU&#146;s meet the definition of a participating security. For RSUs and PSUs issued on
or after January&nbsp;1, 2010, dividends will be payable to the employees only upon vesting and
therefore such RSUs and PSUs do not meet the definition of a participating security.

health pharmaceutical and vaccine products marketed either directly by the Company or through joint
ventures. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, sold
by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. The Company sells these human health
pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies
and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit
managers and other institutions. Vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and
adult vaccines, primarily administered at physician offices. The Company sells these human health
vaccines primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. A
large component of pediatric and adolescent vaccines is sold to the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention Vaccines for Children program, which is funded by the U.S. government. The
Company also has animal health operations that discover, develop, manufacture and market animal
health products, including vaccines. Additionally, the Company has consumer care operations that
develop, manufacture and market over-the-counter, foot care and sun care products in the United
States and Canada.

    <TD>Segment profits are comprised of segment revenues less certain elements of materials and
production costs and operating expenses, including components of equity income (loss)&nbsp;from
affiliates and depreciation and amortization expenses. For internal management reporting presented
to the chief operating decision maker, Merck does not allocate production costs, other than
standard costs, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses, as well
as the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for
monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by
these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits.</TD>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;3, 2009, Merck &#038; Co., Inc. (&#147;Old Merck&#148;) and Schering-Plough Corporation
(&#147;Schering-Plough&#148;) completed their previously-announced merger (the &#147;Merger&#148;). In the Merger,
Schering-Plough acquired all of the shares of Old Merck, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Schering-Plough and was renamed Merck Sharp &#038; Dohme Corp. Schering-Plough continued as the
surviving public company and was renamed Merck &#038; Co., Inc. (&#147;New Merck&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;).
However, for accounting purposes only, the Merger was treated as an acquisition with Old Merck
considered the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements reflect Old
Merck&#146;s stand-alone operations as they existed prior to the completion of the Merger. The results
of Schering-Plough&#146;s business have been included in New Merck&#146;s financial statements only for
periods subsequent to the completion of the Merger. Therefore, financial results in the first
quarter of 2009 do not reflect legacy Schering-Plough operations. References in this report and in
the accompanying financial statements to &#147;Merck&#148; for periods prior to the Merger refer to Old Merck
and for periods after the completion of the Merger to New Merck.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>U.S. Health Care Reform Legislation</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2010, the United States enacted health care reform legislation.
Important market reforms begin this year and more significant reforms begin in 2014. As a result, the new law is
expected to expand access to health care to more than 32&nbsp;million Americans by the end of the decade. In the first quarter of 2010,
Merck incurred additional costs as a result of the new law, including increased Medicaid rebates and other impacts
that reduced revenues by approximately $33&nbsp;million. Beginning in 2010, the legislation includes an increase in the minimum rebate to states participating in the
Medicaid program from 15.1% to 23.1% on the Company&#146;s branded prescription drugs; the extension of
the Medicaid rebate to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations; and the expansion of section 340B eligibility to rural referral centers, sole community hospitals,
critical access hospitals, certain free standing cancer hospitals
and certain additional children&#146;s
hospitals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company also recorded a charge of $147&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2010 associated
with this legislation that changed tax law to require taxation of the prescription drug subsidy of
the Company&#146;s retiree health benefit plans for which companies receive reimbursement under Medicare Part&nbsp;D.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Beginning in 2011, the new legislation requires drug manufacturers to pay a 50% discount
on Medicare Part&nbsp;D utilization incurred by beneficiaries when they are in the Medicare Part&nbsp;D coverage gap
(i.e., the &#147;donut hole&#148;). Also, beginning in 2011, the Company will incur an annual health care reform
fee, which is being assessed on all branded prescription drug manufacturers and importers. Sales
included in the calculation of the fee are those made to the following federal programs or entities or
pursuant to coverage under these programs: Medicare Part&nbsp;D, Medicare Part&nbsp;B, Medicaid, VA, DoD, and
the TRICARE program. The fee will be calculated based on the industry&#146;s total sales of branded
prescription drugs to these specified government programs. The percentage of a manufacturer&#146;s
sales that are included is determined by a tiered scale based on the manufacturer&#146;s individual
revenues. Each manufacturer&#146;s portion of the total annual fee (ranging from $2.5&nbsp;billion to
$4.1&nbsp;billion annually) will be based on the manufacturer&#146;s proportion of the total includable sales in the prior
year. As additional guidance and regulations are issued, the Company will revise its implementation approach as appropriate and will
continue to assess the impact of the legislation accordingly.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Management</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2010, the Company announced changes in responsibilities for three of its top leaders.
Richard T. Clark, currently chairman, CEO and president, will continue leading the Company as
chairman and CEO. Kenneth C. Frazier, currently president of Global Human Health, was elected Company president as of May 1 by the Merck
Board of Directors, reporting to Mr.&nbsp;Clark. Adam H. Schechter, who currently leads the Company&#146;s
pharmaceutical business in the United States, was elected to succeed Mr.&nbsp;Frazier as president of
Global Human Health.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Sales</I>

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Worldwide sales were $11.4&nbsp;billion for the first quarter of 2010 compared with $5.4&nbsp;billion in
the first quarter of 2009. Foreign exchange favorably affected global sales performance by 4%.
The revenue increase largely reflects incremental sales resulting from the inclusion of legacy
Schering-Plough products in the first quarter of 2010, such as <I>Remicade</I>, <I>Nasonex</I>, <I>Temodar</I>,
<I>PegIntron </I>and <I>Clarinex</I>, as well as the recognition of revenue from sales of <I>Zetia </I>and <I>Vytorin</I>.
Prior to the Merger, sales of <I>Zetia </I>and <I>Vytorin </I>were recognized by the Merck/Schering-Plough
partnership (the &#147;MSP Partnership&#148;) and the results of Old Merck&#146;s interest in the MSP Partnership
were recorded in <I>Equity income from affiliates</I>. As a result of the Merger, the MSP Partnership
became wholly-owned by the Company and therefore revenues from these products for the first quarter
of 2010 are reflected in <I>Sales</I>. Additionally, the Company recognized sales during the first
quarter of 2010 from legacy Schering-Plough animal health and consumer care products. Also
contributing to the sales increase was growth in <I>Januvia </I>and <I>Janumet</I>, <I>Singulair </I>and <I>Isentress</I>.
These increases were partially offset by lower sales of <I>Cozaar</I>/<I>Hyzaar</I>*. <I>Cozaar </I>and <I>Hyzaar </I>lost
patent protection in a number of major European markets in March and February&nbsp;2010, respectively.
Revenue was also negatively affected by lower sales of <I>RotaTeq</I>, as well as lower sales of <I>Fosamax </I>and <I>Fosamax Plus D</I>, which
have lost market exclusivity in the United States and in several major European markets, and
<I>Gardasil</I>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the first quarter of 2010, the Company offered a one-time Special Purchase Program
(&#147;SPP&#148;) to certain distributors in the United States in anticipation of the U.S. implementation of an enterprise wide resource planning system (SAP). The SPP allowed
these distributors to purchase up to 3&nbsp;weeks of additional inventory in the first quarter. The SPP
included a 30-day extension on payment terms and special returns provisions for the additional
quantities purchased. Under these special returns provisions, any product purchased under
the SPP may be returned in the second quarter of 2010. As a result of this program, the Company
deferred approximately $580&nbsp;million of pharmaceutical segment sales, which are expected to be
recognized upon expiry of the special terms, net of any actual returns received during the period.
Merck closely monitored order volume purchasing patterns for all customers throughout the first
quarter to ensure that no orders exceeded past purchasing history unless placed under the SPP.

D) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan
participant. These discounts, in the aggregate, reduced revenues by
$1,162.4&nbsp;million and $462.1
million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase was driven
primarily by the inclusion of legacy Schering-Plough and MSP Partnership amounts. Inventory levels at key wholesalers

(the &#147;Merger Restructuring Program&#148;) in conjunction with the integration of the legacy Merck and
legacy Schering-Plough businesses. This Merger Restructuring Program is intended to optimize the
cost structure of the combined Company. As part of the first phase of the Merger Restructuring
Program, by the end of 2012, the Company expects to reduce its total workforce by approximately 15%
across all areas of the Company worldwide. The Company also plans to eliminate 2,500 vacant
positions as part of the first phase of the program. These workforce reductions will primarily come
from the elimination of duplicative positions in sales, administrative and headquarters
organizations, as well as from the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities and research
and development operations. The Company will continue to hire new employees in strategic growth
areas of the business during this period. Certain actions, such as the ongoing reevaluation of
manufacturing and research and development facilities worldwide have not yet been completed, but
will be included later in 2010 in other phases of the Merger Restructuring Program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the Merger Restructuring Program, separation costs under the Company&#146;s
existing severance programs worldwide were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 to the extent
such costs were probable and reasonably estimable. The Company
commenced accruing costs related to enhanced
termination benefits offered to employees under the Merger Restructuring Program in the first
quarter of 2010 when the necessary criteria were met. The Company recorded total pretax
restructuring costs of $283.2&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2010. This first phase of the Merger
Restructuring Program is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 with the total pretax costs
estimated to be $2.6&nbsp;billion to $3.3&nbsp;billion. The Company estimates that approximately 85% of the
cumulative pretax costs relate to cash outlays, primarily related to employee separation expense.
Approximately 15% of the cumulative pretax costs are non-cash, relating primarily to the
accelerated depreciation of facilities to be closed or divested. The Company expects this first
phase of the Merger Restructuring Program to yield annual savings in 2012 of approximately $2.6
billion to $3.0&nbsp;billion. The Company expects that additional savings will be generated by
subsequent phases of the Merger Restructuring Program that will be announced later this year.
These costs savings, which are expected to come from all areas of the Company&#146;s pharmaceutical
business, are in addition to the previously announced ongoing cost reduction initiatives at both

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In October&nbsp;2008, Old Merck announced a global restructuring program (the &#147;2008 Restructuring
Program&#148;) to reduce its cost structure, increase efficiency, and enhance competitiveness. As part
of the 2008 Restructuring Program, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 7,200 positions &#151;
6,800 active employees and 400 vacancies &#151; across all areas of the Company worldwide by the end of
2011. Pretax restructuring costs of $64.9&nbsp;million and $174.6&nbsp;million were recorded in the first
quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to the 2008 Restructuring Program. The 2008
Restructuring Program is expected to be completed by the end of 2011 with the total pretax costs
estimated to be $1.6&nbsp;billion to $2.0&nbsp;billion. The Company estimates that two-thirds of the
cumulative pretax costs relate to cash outlays, primarily from employee separation expense.
Approximately one-third of the cumulative pretax costs are non-cash, relating primarily to the
accelerated depreciation of facilities to be closed or divested. Merck expects the 2008
Restructuring Program to yield cumulative pretax savings of $3.8&nbsp;billion to $4.2&nbsp;billion from 2008
to 2013.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company anticipates that total costs associated with restructuring activities in 2010 for
the Merger Restructuring Program and the 2008 Restructuring Program will be in the range of $700
million to $900&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Prior to the Merger, Schering-Plough commenced a Productivity Transformation Program which was
designed to reduce and avoid costs and increase productivity. Costs associated with this program
were $2.6&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The costs associated with all of these restructuring activities are comprised of accelerated
depreciation and separation costs recorded in <I>Materials and production</I>, <I>Research and development</I>
and <I>Restructuring costs </I>(see Note 3 to the interim consolidated financial statements).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Materials and production costs were $5.2&nbsp;billion for the first quarter of 2010 compared with
$1.3&nbsp;billion for the first quarter of 2009. Materials and production costs include expenses
related to the sale of legacy Schering-Plough products in the first quarter of 2010. Additionally,
in the first quarter of 2010, these costs include $1.2&nbsp;billion of amortization of purchase
accounting adjustments to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Schering-Plough&#146;s inventories and $1.2&nbsp;billion of expense for the
amortization of intangible assets recognized as a result of the Merger. Also included in materials and
production costs in the first quarter of 2010 and 2009 were costs associated with restructuring
activities of
$56.8&nbsp;million and $22.2&nbsp;million, respectively, substantially all of which represents
accelerated depreciation associated with the planned closure of manufacturing facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Gross margin was 54.3% in the first quarter of 2010 compared with 75.2% in the first quarter
of 2009. The amortization expenses recorded in 2010 as a result of the Merger and the
restructuring charges reflected in both periods as noted above had an unfavorable effect on gross margin of 21.1
and 0.4&nbsp;percentage points, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Marketing and administrative expenses were $3.2&nbsp;billion in the first quarter of 2010 compared
with $1.6&nbsp;billion in the first quarter of 2009 driven largely by the inclusion of expenses related
to legacy Schering-Plough activities. Additionally, $79.5&nbsp;million of merger-related costs were
recognized in the first quarter of 2010 consisting largely of integration costs compared with $6.6
million expenses in the first quarter of 2009. Also, marketing and administrative expenses in the
first quarter of 2010 reflect the impact of reserving an additional $30&nbsp;million and $20&nbsp;million,
respectively, solely for future legal defense for the <I>Vioxx </I>and <I>Fosamax </I>litigation. These
increases were partially offset by initiatives to reduce the cost base. Separation costs
associated with sales force reductions have been incurred and are reflected in <I>Restructuring costs</I>
as discussed below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Research and development expenses were $2.0&nbsp;billion for the first quarter of 2010 compared
with $1.2&nbsp;billion in the first quarter of 2009, due largely to incremental expenditures associated
with the inclusion of legacy Schering-Plough results. In addition, expenses for the first
quarter of 2010 include $27&nbsp;million of impairment charges associated with in-process research and
development (&#147;IPR&#038;D&#148;) for previously in-licensed projects capitalized in connection with the Merger
that were subsequently abandoned in connection with the Company&#146;s pipeline prioritization review
and returned to the respective licensors. The Company may recognize additional non-cash impairment
charges in the future for the cancellation of other legacy Schering-Plough pipeline programs that
were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with the Merger. Expenses in the first
quarter of 2010 reflect $6.2&nbsp;million of asset abandonment costs associated with restructuring
activities. Expenses in the first quarter of 2009 reflect $88.1&nbsp;million of costs related to
restructuring activities, substantially all of which represent accelerated depreciation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In May 2010, Merck announced that it had restructured its co-development and co-commercialization agreement
with ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;ARIAD&#148;) for ridaforolimus, an investigational orally available mTOR
inhibitor currently being evaluated for the treatment of multiple cancer types, to an exclusive license agreement.
Under the restructured agreement, Merck has acquired full control of the development and worldwide
commercialization of ridaforolimus.  ARIAD will receive a $50 million upfront fee, which the Company will record
as research and development expense, and is eligible to receive milestone payments associated with regulatory
filings and approvals of ridaforolimus in multiple cancer indications and achievement of significant sales thresholds.
In lieu of the profit split on U.S. sales provided for in the previous agreement, ARIAD will now receive royalties on
global net sales of ridaforolimus, and all sales will be recorded by Merck.  Merck will assume responsibility for all
activities and has acquired decision rights on matters relating to the development, manufacturing and
commercialization of ridaforolimus.  The Investigational New Drug application will be transferred to Merck, and
Merck will file the marketing application worldwide for any oncology indications and lead all interactions with
regulatory agencies.
</div>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Restructuring costs, primarily representing separation and other related costs associated with
restructuring activities, were $287.7&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2010 and $64.3&nbsp;million in the
first quarter of 2009. Of the amount recorded in the first quarter of 2010, $251.9&nbsp;million related
to the Merger Restructuring Program and the remainder related to the 2008 Restructuring Program.
All of the costs recognized in 2009 related to the 2008 Restructuring Program. Separation costs of
$227.7&nbsp;million and $28.2&nbsp;million were incurred in the first quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively,
associated with actual headcount reductions, as well as estimated expenses under existing severance
programs for headcount reductions that were probable and could be reasonably estimated. Merck
eliminated 5,730 positions in the first quarter of 2010 of which 5,150 related to the Merger
Restructuring Program, 535 related to the 2008 Restructuring Program and the remainder to the
legacy Schering-Plough Productivity Transformation Program. In the first quarter of 2009,
approximately 1,050 positions were eliminated in connection with the 2008 Restructuring Program.
These position eliminations are comprised of actual headcount reductions, and the elimination of
contractors and vacant positions. Also included in restructuring costs are curtailment, settlement
and termination charges on pension and other postretirement benefit plans and shutdown costs. For
segment reporting, restructuring costs are unallocated expenses. Additional costs associated with
the Company&#146;s restructuring activities are included in <I>Materials and production </I>costs and <I>Research
and development </I>expenses. (See Note 3 to the interim consolidated financial statements.)
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Equity income from affiliates, which reflects the performance of the Company&#146;s joint ventures
and other equity method affiliates, declined to $137.5&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2010 from
$585.8&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2009. Equity income from affiliates no longer includes
equity income from the MSP Partnership, which became wholly-owned by the Company as a result of the
Merger and therefore its results have been included in the consolidated results of the Company
beginning on the date of the Merger, or from Merial Limited due to the sale of Old Merck&#146;s interest
in September&nbsp;2009. In addition, lower partnership returns from AZLP also contributed to the
decline. (See &#147;Selected Joint Venture and Affiliate Information&#148; below.)
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Other (income)&nbsp;expense, net was $167.7&nbsp;million of expense in the first quarter of 2010
compared with $67.2&nbsp;million of income in the first quarter of 2009 primarily reflecting higher
interest expense and lower interest income largely attributable to the financing of the Merger. In
addition, during the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded higher exchange losses of $80
million due to the Venezuela currency devaluation. Effective January&nbsp;11, 2010, the Venezuelan
government devalued its currency from at BsF 2.15 per U.S. dollar to a two-tiered official exchange
rate at (1) &#147;the essentials rate&#148; at BsF 2.60 per U.S. dollar and (2) &#147;the non-essentials rate&#148; at
BsF 4.30 per U.S. dollar. The Company anticipates that its transactions will be settled at the
essentials rate. Merck was required to remeasure its local currency operations in Venezuelan to
U.S. dollars as the Venezuelan economy was determined to be hyperinflationary. Also, during the
first quarter of 2010, the Company recognized $102&nbsp;million of income on the settlement of certain
disputed royalties. Other (income) expense, net included $7.3 million and $12.5 million of merger-related costs for the first quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Segment profits are comprised of segment revenues less certain elements of materials and
production costs and operating expenses, including components of equity income (loss)&nbsp;from
affiliates and depreciation and amortization expenses. For internal management reporting presented
to the chief operating decision maker, Merck does not allocate production costs, other than
standard costs, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses, as well
as the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for
monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by
these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. Also excluded from the
determination of segment profits are the amortization of purchase
accounting adjustments, taxes paid at the joint venture level and a portion of equity
income. Additionally, segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and
manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income (expense). These unallocated items are
reflected in &#147;Other&#148; in the above table. Also included in Other are miscellaneous corporate
profits, operating profits related to divested products or businesses, other supply sales and
adjustments to eliminate the effect of double counting certain items
of income and expense. The increase in Other during the first quarter
of 2010 is primarily due to the inclusion of legacy Schering-Plough
activities, as well as the amortization of purchase accounting
adjustments and higher restructuring costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Pharmaceutical segment profits rose 78% in the first quarter of 2010 driven largely by the
inclusion of legacy Schering-Plough results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The
effective tax rate of 46.4% for the first quarter of 2010 reflects
the impact of a  $146.5&nbsp;million charge, or approximately 24&nbsp;percentage points, associated with a change in tax law that
requires taxation of the prescription drug subsidy of the Company&#146;s retiree health benefit plans
which was enacted in the first quarter of 2010 as part of U.S. health care reform legislation, as
well by the impacts of purchase accounting adjustments and restructuring charges. The effective
tax rate of 18.4% for the first quarter of 2009 reflects a favorable impact of approximately 5
percentage points resulting from the previously disclosed settlement reached with the Canada
Revenue Agency (&#147;CRA&#148;) and restructuring charges.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Net income attributable to Merck &#038; Co., Inc. was $298.8&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2010
compared with $1.4&nbsp;billion for the first quarter of 2009. Earnings per common share assuming
dilution attributable to Merck &#038; Co., Inc. common shareholders (&#147;EPS&#148;) for the first quarter of
2010 were $0.09 compared with $0.67 in the first quarter of 2009. The declines in net income and
EPS in the first quarter of 2010 were primarily due to incremental costs as a result of the Merger,
including the amortization of inventory step-up and intangible assets. In addition, higher
restructuring costs and the impact of U.S. health care reform legislation also contributed to the
declines. EPS in 2010 was also affected by the dilutive impact of shares issued in conjunction
with the Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are alternative views of the Company&#146;s performance used by
management that Merck is providing because management believes this information enhances investors&#146;
understanding of the Company&#146;s results. Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP earnings per share exclude
certain items because of the nature of these items and the impact that they have on the analysis of
underlying business performance and trends. The excluded items include certain purchase accounting
items related to the Merger, restructuring activities, merger-related costs, and certain other
items. These excluded items are significant components in understanding and assessing financial
performance. Therefore, the information on non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS should be considered
in addition to, but not in lieu of, net income and earnings per share prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;). Additionally, since
non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, they have no
standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of
similar measures of other companies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are important internal measures for the Company. Senior
management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes non-GAAP income and
non-GAAP EPS and the performance of the Company is measured on this basis along with other
performance metrics. Senior management&#146;s annual compensation is derived in part using non-GAAP
income and non-GAAP EPS.

their existing joint venture whereby Old Merck acquired Astra&#146;s interest in KBI Inc. (&#147;KBI&#148;), and
contributed KBI&#146;s operating assets to a new U.S. limited partnership, Astra Pharmaceuticals L.P.
(the &#147;Partnership&#148;), in exchange for a 1% limited partner interest. Astra contributed the net
assets of its wholly owned subsidiary, Astra USA, Inc., to the Partnership in exchange for a 99%
general partner interest. The Partnership, renamed AstraZeneca LP (&#147;AZLP&#148;) upon Astra&#146;s 1999 merger

addition, in 1998, Old Merck granted Astra an option (the &#147;Shares Option&#148;) to buy Old Merck&#146;s

exercisable two years after Astra&#146;s exercise of the Asset Option. Astra can also exercise the
Shares Option in 2017 or if combined annual sales of the two products fall below a minimum amount
provided, in each case, only so long as AstraZeneca&#146;s Asset Option has been exercised in 2010. The
exercise price for the Shares Option is based on the net present value of estimated future net

billion in cash. In connection with the sale of Merial, Old Merck, sanofi-aventis and
Schering-Plough signed a call option agreement which provided sanofi-aventis with an option to
require the Company to combine its Intervet/Schering-Plough Animal Health business with Merial to
form an animal health joint venture that would be owned equally by the Company and sanofi-aventis.
In March&nbsp;2010, sanofi-aventis exercised its option. As part of the call option agreement, the
value of Merial has been fixed at $8&nbsp;billion. The minimum total value to be received by the
Company for contributing Intervet/Schering-Plough to the combined entity would be $9.25&nbsp;billion
(subject to customary transaction adjustments), consisting of a floor valuation of
Intervet/Schering-Plough which is fixed at a minimum of $8.5&nbsp;billion (which was subject to
potential upward revision based on a valuation exercise by the two parties) and an additional
payment by sanofi-aventis of $750&nbsp;million. Based on the valuation exercise, the value of
Intervet/Schering-Plough was determined to be $8.5&nbsp;billion, leading to a future payment of $250
million by sanofi-aventis to the Company to true-up the value of the contributions so that they are
equal pursuant to the terms of the agreement. All payments, including adjustments for debt and
certain other liabilities, will be made upon closing of the transaction. The formation of this new
animal health joint venture is subject to execution of final agreements, antitrust review in the
United States, Europe and other countries and other customary closing conditions. On March&nbsp;30,
2010, the parties signed the contribution agreement which obligates them, subject to regulatory
approval, to form the joint venture. The Company expects the transaction to close in the first
quarter of 2011.

activities in the first quarter of 2009 reflecting an increase in short-term borrowings and
higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by higher payments on

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously disclosed, in October&nbsp;2006, the CRA issued Old Merck a notice of reassessment
containing adjustments related to certain intercompany pricing matters. In February&nbsp;2009, Old
Merck and the CRA negotiated a settlement agreement in regard to these matters. In accordance with
the settlement, Old Merck paid an additional tax of approximately $300&nbsp;million (U.S. dollars) and
interest of approximately $360&nbsp;million (U.S. dollars) with no additional amounts or penalties due
on this assessment. The settlement was accounted for in the first quarter of 2009. Old Merck had
previously established reserves for these matters. A significant portion of the taxes paid is
expected to be creditable for U.S. tax purposes. The resolution of these matters did not have a
material effect on financial position or liquidity, other than with respect to the associated
collateral as discussed below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, in July&nbsp;2007 and November&nbsp;2008, the CRA proposed additional adjustments for 1999
and 2000, respectively, relating to other intercompany pricing matters. The adjustments would
increase Canadian tax due by approximately $318&nbsp;million (U.S. dollars) plus approximately $328
million (U.S. dollars) of interest through March&nbsp;31, 2010. It is possible that the CRA will
propose similar adjustments for later years. The Company disagrees with the positions taken by the
CRA and believes they are without merit. The Company intends to contest the assessments through
the CRA appeals process and the courts if necessary. Management believes that resolution of these
matters will not have a material effect on the Company&#146;s financial position or liquidity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the appeals process for the matters discussed above, during 2007, the
Company pledged collateral to two financial institutions, one of which provided a guarantee to the
CRA and the other to the Quebec Ministry of Revenue representing a portion of the tax and interest
assessed. As a result of the settlement noted above, guarantees required to appeal the disputes
were reduced or eliminated and a portion of associated collateral was released. Certain of the
cash and investments continue to be collateralized for guarantees required to appeal other Canadian
tax disputes. The collateral is included in <I>Deferred income taxes and other current assets </I>and
<I>Other assets </I>in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and totaled approximately $320&nbsp;million and $290
million at March&nbsp;31, 2010 and December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively.

2010 pertaining to the former Schering-Plough for the years 2003 to  2006. The proposed adjustments
to income contained in the report amount to approximately $1&nbsp;billion and relate to certain
intercompany pricing matters. The Company vigorously disagrees with the proposed adjustments and
believes they are without merit. The tax that would be assessed as a result of the RAR as stated
would approximate $370&nbsp;million and would mostly reduce net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;) and other tax
credit carryforwards. The Company believes that the resolution of this matter will not have a
material impact to its results of operations. The Company intends to pursue
all administrative remedies available to it, including the IRS appeals process and the courts if
necessary.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">after June&nbsp;15, 2010, although early
adoption is permitted. This guidance eliminates the residual method under the current guidance and
replaces it with the &#147;relative selling price&#148; method when allocating revenue in a multiple
deliverable arrangement. The selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor
specific objective evidence of selling price, if it exists, otherwise third-party evidence of
selling price shall be used. If neither exists for a deliverable, the vendor shall use its best
estimate of the selling
price for that deliverable. After adoption, this guidance will also require expanded
qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The Company is currently assessing the impact of
adoption on its financial position and results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In January&nbsp;2010, the FASB amended the existing disclosure guidance on fair value measurements,
which is effective January&nbsp;1, 2010, except for disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and
settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which is effective
January&nbsp;1, 2011. Among other things, the updated guidance requires additional disclosure for the
amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 measurements and requires
certain Level 3 disclosures on a gross basis. Additionally, the updates amend existing guidance to
require a greater level of disaggregated information and more robust disclosures about valuation
techniques and inputs to fair value measurements. Since the amended guidance requires only
additional disclosures, the adoption of the provisions effective January&nbsp;1, 2011 will not impact
the Company&#146;s financial position or results of operations.

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal
to its business, including product liability, intellectual property, and commercial litigation, as
well as additional matters such as antitrust actions. The following discussion is limited to
recent developments concerning legal proceedings and should be read in conjunction with the interim
consolidated financial statements contained in this report and the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 contained in the Company&#146;s Form 10-K filed on March
1, 2010.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Product Liability Lawsuits</I>

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously disclosed, individual and putative class actions have been filed against Old
Merck in state and federal courts alleging personal injury and/or economic loss with respect to the
purchase or use of <I>Vioxx</I>. All such actions filed in federal court are coordinated in a
multidistrict litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (the
&#147;MDL&#148;) before District Judge Eldon E. Fallon. A number of such actions filed in state court are
coordinated in separate coordinated proceedings in state courts in New Jersey, California and
Texas, and the counties of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Washoe and Clark Counties, Nevada. As of
March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company had been served or was aware that it had been named as a defendant in
approximately 6,975 pending lawsuits, which include approximately 15,000 plaintiff groups, alleging
personal injuries resulting from the use of <I>Vioxx</I>, and in approximately 41 putative class actions
alleging personal injuries and/or economic loss. (All of the actions discussed in this paragraph
and in &#147;Other Lawsuits&#148; below are collectively referred to as the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability
Lawsuits.&#148;) Of these lawsuits, approximately 5,525 lawsuits representing approximately 11,800
plaintiff groups are or are slated to be in the federal MDL and approximately 10 lawsuits
representing approximately 10 plaintiff groups are included in a coordinated proceeding in New
Jersey Superior Court before Judge Carol E. Higbee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Of the plaintiff groups described above, most are currently in the <I>Vioxx </I>Settlement Program,
described below. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, 50 plaintiff groups who were otherwise eligible for the
Settlement Program have not participated and their claims remain pending against Old Merck. In
addition, the claims of approximately 150 plaintiff groups who are not eligible for the Settlement
Program remain pending against Old Merck. A number of these 150 plaintiff groups are subject to
various motions to dismiss for failure to comply with court-ordered deadlines. Since March&nbsp;31,
2010, certain of these plaintiff groups have since been dismissed. In addition, the claims of over
39,800 plaintiffs had been dismissed as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, the vast majority of which were
dismissed as a result of the settlement process discussed below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;9, 2007, Old Merck announced that it had entered into an agreement (the
&#147;Settlement Agreement&#148;) with the law firms that comprise the executive committee of the Plaintiffs&#146;
Steering Committee (&#147;PSC&#148;) of the federal <I>Vioxx </I>MDL, as well as representatives of plaintiffs&#146;
counsel in the Texas, New Jersey and California state coordinated proceedings, to resolve state and
federal myocardial infarction (&#147;MI&#148;) and ischemic stroke (&#147;IS&#148;) claims filed as of that date in the
United States. The Settlement Agreement applies only to U.S. legal residents and those who allege
that their MI or IS occurred in the United States. The Settlement Agreement provided for Old Merck
to pay a fixed aggregate amount of $4.85&nbsp;billion into two funds ($4.0&nbsp;billion for MI claims and
$850&nbsp;million for IS claims) (the &#147;Settlement Program&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Interim and final payments have been made to certain qualifying claimants. It is expected
that the remainder of the full $4.85&nbsp;billion will be distributed in the first half of 2010. The
Company completed making payments into the settlement funds in 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There has been one U.S. <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuit trial held in 2010. That trial in the
Louisiana Attorney General matter is discussed below. The second U.S.
<I>Vioxx</I> Product Liability Lawsuit scheduled for trial in 2010
was dismissed with prejudice before the trial commenced. There are no other U.S. <I>Vioxx </I>Product
Liability Lawsuits currently scheduled for trial in 2010. Old Merck has previously disclosed the
outcomes of several <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits that were tried prior to 2010.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Of the cases that went to trial, there are two unresolved post-trial appeals: <I>Ernst v. Merck</I>
and <I>Garza v. Merck</I>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously reported, in September&nbsp;2006, Old Merck filed a notice of appeal of the August
2005 jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the Texas state court case, <I>Ernst v. Merck</I>. On
May&nbsp;29, 2008, the Texas Court of Appeals reversed the trial court&#146;s judgment and issued a judgment
in favor of Old Merck. The Court of Appeals found the evidence to be legally insufficient on the
issue of causation. Plaintiff filed a motion for rehearing <I>en banc </I>in the Court of Appeals. On
June&nbsp;4, 2009, in response to plaintiff&#146;s
motion for rehearing, the Court of Appeals issued a new opinion reversing the jury&#146;s verdict
and rendered judgment for Old Merck. On September&nbsp;8, 2009, plaintiff filed a second motion for
rehearing <I>en banc, </I>which the Court of Appeals denied on November&nbsp;19, 2009. On December&nbsp;7, 2009,
plaintiff filed another motion for rehearing, which the Court of Appeals again denied. Plaintiff
filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court of Texas on
February&nbsp;3, 2010.  Old Merck&#146;s deadline to respond is May
17, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously reported, in April&nbsp;2006, in <I>Garza v. Merck</I>, a jury in state court in Rio Grande
City, Texas returned a verdict in favor of the family of decedent Leonel Garza. The jury awarded a
total of $7&nbsp;million in compensatory damages to Mr.&nbsp;Garza&#146;s widow and three sons. The jury also
purported to award $25&nbsp;million in punitive damages even though under Texas law, in this case,
potential punitive damages were capped at $750,000. In May&nbsp;2008, the San Antonio Court of Appeals
reversed the judgment and rendered a judgment in favor of Old Merck. In December&nbsp;2008, the Court
of Appeals, on rehearing, vacated its prior ruling and issued a replacement. In the new ruling,
the court ordered a take-nothing judgment for Old Merck on the design defect claim, but reversed
and remanded for a new trial as to the strict liability claim because of juror misconduct. In
January&nbsp;2009, Old Merck filed a petition for review with the Texas Supreme Court. The Texas
Supreme Court granted Old Merck&#146;s petition for review and oral argument was held on January&nbsp;20,
2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Other Lawsuits</I>

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Approximately 190 claims by individual private third-party payors were filed in the New Jersey
court and in federal court in the MDL. On September&nbsp;15, 2009, Old Merck announced it had finalized
a settlement agreement, which it had previously disclosed, to resolve all pending lawsuits in which
U.S.-based private third-party payors (&#147;TPPs&#148;) sought reimbursement for covering <I>Vioxx </I>purchased by
their plan members. Certain other claimants participated in the resolution as well. The agreement
provided that Old Merck did not admit wrongdoing or fault. Under the settlement agreement, Old
Merck paid a fixed total of $80&nbsp;million. This amount includes a settlement fund that will be
divided among the TPPs (insurers, employee benefit plans and union welfare funds) participating in
the resolution in accordance with a formula that is based on product volume and a provision for
potential payment of attorneys&#146; fees. In return, the settling TPPs will dismiss their lawsuits and
release their claims against Old Merck. Stipulated dismissals of the settled TTP actions were filed
in New Jersey and the MDL in December&nbsp;2009. Old Merck recorded a charge of $80&nbsp;million in the
second quarter of 2009 related to the settlement and paid the $80&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of
2009. Since the settlement, one additional TPP case has been filed, which is pending in the MDL
proceeding.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Separately, there are also still pending in various U.S. courts putative class actions
purportedly brought on behalf of individual purchasers or users of <I>Vioxx </I>and seeking reimbursement
of alleged economic loss. In the MDL proceeding, 33 such class actions remain. In 2005, Old Merck
moved to dismiss a master complaint that includes these cases, but the MDL court has not yet ruled
on that motion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;17, 2009, the New Jersey Superior Court denied plaintiffs&#146; motion for class
certification in <I>Martin-Kleinman v. Merck</I>, a putative consumer class action. Plaintiffs moved for
leave to appeal the decision to the New Jersey Supreme Court on November&nbsp;6, 2009. On January&nbsp;12,
2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court denied plaintiff&#146;s request for appellate review of the denial of
class certification.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On June&nbsp;12, 2008, a Missouri state court certified a class of Missouri plaintiffs seeking
reimbursement for out-of-pocket costs relating to <I>Vioxx. </I>The plaintiffs do not allege any personal
injuries from taking <I>Vioxx. </I>The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court&#146;s certification
of a class on May&nbsp;12, 2009, and the Missouri Supreme Court denied Old Merck&#146;s application for
review of that decision on September&nbsp;1, 2009. Trial has been set for April&nbsp;11, 2011. In addition,
in Indiana, plaintiffs have filed a motion to certify a class of Indiana <I>Vioxx </I>purchasers in a case
pending before the Circuit Court of Marion County, Indiana; discovery in that case is ongoing.



On April 1, 2010, a Kentucky state court denied Merck&#146;s motion for summary judgment and certified a class of
Kentucky plaintiffs seeking reimbursement for out-of-pocket costs
relating to <I>Vioxx</I>.  In response, Merck has filed a
petition for writ of mandamus seeking interlocutory appellate review of the court&#146;s rulings.  In Illinois, all of the
plaintiffs who filed four separate putative class actions in Illinois state courts (&#147;Amisch&#148; and &#147;Caruso&#148;) voluntarily
dismissed their lawsuits.



</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Plaintiffs also filed a class action in California state court seeking certification of a
class of California third-party payors and end-users. The trial court denied the motion for class
certification on April&nbsp;30, 2009, and the Court of Appeal affirmed that ruling on December&nbsp;15, 2009.
On January&nbsp;25, 2010, plaintiffs filed a petition for review with the California Supreme Court,
which was denied on March&nbsp;30, 2010.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Old Merck has also been named as a defendant in twenty-one separate lawsuits brought by
government entities, including the Attorneys General of thirteen states, five counties, the City of
New York, and private citizens (who have brought <I>qui tam </I>and taxpayer derivative suits). These
actions allege that Old Merck misrepresented the safety of <I>Vioxx </I>and seek: (i)&nbsp;recovery of the cost
of <I>Vioxx </I>purchased or reimbursed by the government entity and its agencies; (ii)&nbsp;reimbursement of
all sums paid by the government entity and its agencies for medical services for the treatment of
persons injured by <I>Vioxx</I>; (iii)&nbsp;damages under various common law theories; and/or (iv)&nbsp;remedies
under various state statutory theories, including state consumer fraud and/or fair business
practices or Medicaid fraud statutes, including civil penalties. Eleven of the thirteen cases are
pending in the MDL proceeding, and two were remanded to state court. One of the lawsuits brought by
the counties is a class action filed by Santa Clara County, California on behalf of all similarly
situated California counties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Old Merck&#146;s motion for summary judgment was granted in November&nbsp;2009 in a case brought by the
Attorney General of Texas that was scheduled to go to trial in early 2010. The Texas Attorney
General did not appeal. In the Michigan Attorney General case, Old Merck is currently seeking
appellate review of the trial court&#146;s order denying Old Merck&#146;s motion to dismiss. The trial court
has entered a stay of proceedings (including discovery) pending the result of that appeal.
Finally, the Attorney General actions in the MDL described in the previous paragraph are in the
discovery phase. On March&nbsp;31, 2010, Judge Fallon partially granted and partially denied Old
Merck&#146;s motion for summary judgment in the Louisiana Attorney General case. A trial on the
remaining claims before Judge Fallon began on April&nbsp;12, 2010 and was completed on April&nbsp;21, 2010.
A decision is pending.

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously disclosed, in addition to the <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits, Old Merck and
various current and former officers and directors are defendants in various putative class actions
and individual lawsuits under the federal securities laws and state securities laws (the &#147;<I>Vioxx</I>
Securities Lawsuits&#148;). All of the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits pending in federal court have been
transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the &#147;JPML&#148;) to the U.S. District
Court for the District of New Jersey before District Judge Stanley R. Chesler for inclusion in a
nationwide MDL (the &#147;Shareholder MDL&#148;). Judge Chesler has consolidated the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities
Lawsuits for all purposes. The putative class action, which requested damages on behalf of
purchasers of Old Merck stock between May&nbsp;21, 1999 and October&nbsp;29, 2004, alleged that the
defendants made false and misleading statements regarding <I>Vioxx </I>in violation of Sections 10(b) and
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and sought unspecified compensatory damages and the
costs of suit, including attorneys&#146; fees. The complaint also asserted claims under Section&nbsp;20A of
the Securities and Exchange Act against certain defendants relating to their sales of Old Merck
stock and under Sections&nbsp;11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 against certain defendants
based on statements in a registration statement and certain prospectuses filed in connection with
the Old Merck Stock Investment Plan, a dividend reinvestment plan. On April&nbsp;12, 2007, Judge
Chesler granted defendants&#146; motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. Plaintiffs appealed
Judge Chesler&#146;s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On September&nbsp;9, 2008,
the Third Circuit issued an opinion reversing Judge Chesler&#146;s order and remanding the case to the
District Court. Old Merck filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme
Court on January&nbsp;15, 2009, which the Supreme Court granted on May&nbsp;26, 2009. While the petition for
certiorari was pending, plaintiffs filed their Consolidated and Fifth Amended Class&nbsp;Action
Complaint in the District Court. Old Merck filed a motion to dismiss that complaint on May&nbsp;1,
2009, following which the District Court proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of the Supreme
Court appeal. On September&nbsp;16, 2009, Old Merck withdrew its motion to dismiss in the District
Court without prejudice to its right to re-file such a motion pending the outcome of the Supreme
Court appeal. On November&nbsp;30, 2009, the Supreme Court heard oral argument. On April&nbsp;27, 2010, the
Supreme Court affirmed the Third Circuit&#146;s order reversing the District Court&#146;s dismissal of the
then-operative complaint. The case is being returned to the District Court for further proceedings.
Old Merck has stated its intention to renew its motion to dismiss the Fifth Amended Class&nbsp;Action
Complaint.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In October&nbsp;2005, a Dutch pension fund filed a complaint in the District of New Jersey alleging
violations of federal securities laws as well as violations of state law against Old Merck and
certain officers. Pursuant to the Case Management Order governing the Shareholder MDL, the case,
which is based on the same allegations as the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits, was consolidated with the
<I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits. Defendants&#146; motion to dismiss the pension fund&#146;s complaint was filed on
August&nbsp;3, 2007. In September&nbsp;2007, the Dutch pension fund filed an amended complaint rather than
responding to defendants&#146; motion to dismiss. In addition, in 2007, six new complaints were filed
in the District of New Jersey on behalf of various foreign institutional investors also alleging
violations of federal securities laws as well as violations of state law against Old Merck and
certain officers. By stipulation, defendants are not required to respond to these complaints until
the resolution of any motion to dismiss in the consolidated securities action.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, as previously disclosed, various putative class actions filed in federal court
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#147;ERISA&#148;) against Old Merck and certain current
and former officers and directors (the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>ERISA Lawsuits&#148; and, together with the <I>Vioxx</I>
Securities Lawsuits and the <I>Vioxx </I>Derivative Lawsuits described below, the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Shareholder
Lawsuits&#148;) have been transferred to the Shareholder MDL and consolidated for all purposes. The
consolidated complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty on behalf of certain of Old
Merck&#146;s current and former employees who are participants in certain of Old Merck&#146;s retirement
plans. The complaint makes similar allegations with respect to <I>Vioxx </I>to the allegations contained
in the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits. On July&nbsp;11, 2006, Judge Chesler granted in part and denied in
part defendants&#146; motion to dismiss the ERISA complaint. On October&nbsp;19, 2007, plaintiffs moved for

retirement savings plans at any time between October&nbsp;1, 1998 and September&nbsp;30, 2004 and whose plan
accounts included investments in the Old Merck Common Stock Fund and/or Old Merck common stock. On
February&nbsp;9, 2009, the court denied the motion for certification of a class as to one count and
granted the motion as to the remaining counts. The court also excluded from the class definition
those individuals who (i)&nbsp;were not injured in connection with their investments in Old Merck stock
and (ii)&nbsp;executed post-separation settlement agreements that released their claims under ERISA. On
March&nbsp;23, 2009, Judge Chesler denied defendants&#146; motion for judgment on the pleadings. On May&nbsp;11,
2009, Judge Chesler entered an order denying plaintiffs&#146; motion for partial summary judgment
against certain individual defendants, which had been filed on December&nbsp;24, 2008. Discovery in the

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously disclosed, on October&nbsp;29, 2004, two individual shareholders made a demand on Old
Merck&#146;s Board to take legal action against Mr.&nbsp;Raymond Gilmartin, former Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer, and other individuals for
allegedly causing damage to Old Merck with respect to the allegedly improper marketing of
<I>Vioxx</I>. In December&nbsp;2004, the Special Committee of the Board of Directors retained the Honorable
John S. Martin, Jr. of Debevoise &#038; Plimpton LLP to conduct an independent investigation of, among
other things, the allegations set forth in the demand. Judge Martin&#146;s report was made public in
September&nbsp;2006. Based on the Special Committee&#146;s recommendation made after careful consideration
of the Martin report and the impact that derivative litigation would have on Old Merck, the Board
rejected the demand. On October&nbsp;11, 2007, two shareholders filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit
purportedly on Old Merck&#146;s behalf in state court in Atlantic County, New Jersey against current and
former officers and directors of Old Merck. Plaintiffs alleged that the Board&#146;s rejection of their
demand was unreasonable and improper, and that the defendants breached various duties to Old Merck
in allowing <I>Vioxx </I>to be marketed. The parties reached a proposed settlement and, on February&nbsp;8,
2010, the court issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement, requiring that notice of
the proposed settlement be made to Merck&#146;s shareholders, and setting a hearing to consider final
approval of the settlement on March&nbsp;22, 2010. On February&nbsp;9, 2010, Merck notified shareholders of
the proposed settlement and its terms. On March&nbsp;22, 2010, the court orally approved the settlement
but reserved judgment on plaintiffs&#146; request for attorneys&#146; fees. On April&nbsp;15, 2010, the court
issued an order approving the settlement and awarding to plaintiffs&#146; attorneys fees and expenses
totaling $9,219,460. Under the settlement, Merck will make certain corporate governance changes
and supplement policies and procedures previously established by the Company. In addition, Merck,
the plaintiffs and the individual defendants have exchanged full, mutual releases of all claims
that were, or could have been, asserted in the derivative actions. The settlement does not
constitute an admission of liability or wrongful conduct by Merck or by any of the defendants named
in the actions. The settlement also resolves the federal consolidated shareholder derivative
action described below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously disclosed, various shareholder derivative actions filed in federal court were
transferred to the Shareholder MDL and consolidated for all purposes by Judge Chesler (the &#147;<I>Vioxx</I>
Derivative Lawsuits&#148;). On May&nbsp;5, 2006, Judge Chesler granted defendants&#146; motion to dismiss on the
grounds that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that demand should be excused and denied
plaintiffs&#146; request for leave to amend their complaint. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing that Judge
Chesler erred in denying plaintiffs&#146; leave to amend their complaint with documents acquired by
stipulation of the parties. On July&nbsp;18, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit reversed the District Court&#146;s decision on the grounds that Judge Chesler should have
allowed plaintiffs to seek leave to amend their complaint using the documents acquired by
stipulation, and remanded the case for the District Court&#146;s consideration of whether, even with the
additional materials, plaintiffs&#146; proposed amendment would be futile. Plaintiffs filed their brief
in support of their request for leave to amend their complaint, along with their proposed amended
complaint, on November&nbsp;9, 2007. The Court denied the motion on June&nbsp;17, 2008, and again dismissed
the case. One of the plaintiffs appealed Judge Chesler&#146;s decision to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit. Oral argument on the appeal was held on July&nbsp;15, 2009. On
November&nbsp;10, 2009, before any decision was issued, the appeal was stayed pending the settlement
reached in the derivative action pending in the New Jersey Superior Court. As discussed above, the
settlement was approved on April&nbsp;15, 2010, and resolves all shareholder derivative litigation
relating to <I>Vioxx</I>. Under the terms of the settlement, the Third Circuit appeal will be voluntarily
dismissed.

granted, the appeal was filed on May&nbsp;20, 2009 and, in accordance with the court&#146;s decision, Old
Merck sought leave to appeal to the Divisional Court, which was denied on December&nbsp;7, 2009. These

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A trial in a representative action in Australia concluded on June&nbsp;25, 2009, in the Federal
Court of Australia. The named plaintiff, who alleged he suffered an MI, seeks to represent others
in Australia who ingested <I>Vioxx </I>and suffered an MI, thrombotic stroke, unstable angina, transient
ischemic attack or peripheral vascular disease. On March&nbsp;30, 2009, the trial judge entered an
order directing that, in advance of all other issues in the proceeding, the issues to be determined
during the trial were those issues of fact and law in the named plaintiff&#146;s individual case, and
those issues of fact and law that the trial judge finds, after hearing the evidence, are
common to the claims of the group members that the named plaintiff has alleged that he
represents. On March&nbsp;5, 2010, the trial judge delivered his judgment. The court decided to
dismiss all claims against Old Merck, specifically finding that Old Merck had done everything that
might reasonably be expected of it in the discharge of its duty of care. With regard to Old
Merck&#146;s Australian subsidiary, Merck Sharp &#038; Dohme (Australia) Pty Ltd, the court decided to
dismiss certain claims but to award the named plaintiff, whom the Court found suffered an MI after
ingesting <I>Vioxx </I>for approximately 33&nbsp;months, compensation based on statutory claims that <I>Vioxx </I>was
not fit for purpose or of merchantable quality, even though the court rejected the applicant&#146;s
claim that Old Merck and its Australian subsidiary knew or ought to have known prior to the
voluntary withdrawal of <I>Vioxx </I>in September&nbsp;2004 that <I>Vioxx </I>materially increased the risk of MI. On
May&nbsp;7, 2010, the court will conduct a hearing to determine the orders to be entered giving effect
to the judgment, in which the court will determine which of its findings of fact and law are common
to the claims of other group members and will consider any other motions that might be brought.
Old Merck&#146;s subsidiary intends to appeal the adverse findings after the orders have been entered.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously disclosed, the Company has Directors and Officers insurance coverage applicable
to the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits and <I>Vioxx </I>Derivative Lawsuits with stated upper limits of

(&#147;DOJ&#148;) requesting information related to Old Merck&#146;s research, marketing and selling activities
with respect to <I>Vioxx </I>in a federal health care investigation under criminal statutes. This
investigation includes subpoenas for witnesses to appear before a grand jury. As previously
disclosed, in March&nbsp;2009, Old Merck received a letter from the U.S. Attorney&#146;s Office for the
District of Massachusetts identifying it as a target of the grand jury investigation regarding
<I>Vioxx</I>. Further, as previously disclosed, investigations are being conducted by local authorities
in certain cities in Europe in order to determine whether any criminal charges should be brought
concerning <I>Vioxx</I>. The Company is cooperating with these governmental entities in their respective

representatives of plaintiffs&#146; counsel in the Texas, New Jersey and California state coordinated
proceedings to resolve state and federal MI and IS claims filed as of that date in the United

or range of loss with respect to the <I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits not included in the Settlement Program. The

not included in the Settlement Program, other than a reserve established in connection with the
resolution of the shareholder derivative lawsuits discussed above, or the <I>Vioxx </I>Investigations.
Unfavorable outcomes in the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued
when probable and reasonably estimable. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, Old Merck had an aggregate
reserve of approximately $110&nbsp;million (the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Reserve&#148;) for the Settlement Program and future
legal defense costs related to the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the first quarter of 2010, Merck spent approximately $42&nbsp;million in the aggregate in
legal defense costs worldwide, related to (i)&nbsp;the <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits, (ii)&nbsp;the <I>Vioxx</I>
Shareholder Lawsuits, (iii)&nbsp;the <I>Vioxx </I>Foreign Lawsuits, and (iv)&nbsp;the <I>Vioxx </I>Investigations
(collectively, the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Litigation&#148;). In addition, during the first quarter of 2010, Merck
recorded a $30&nbsp;million charge solely for its future legal defense costs for the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation.
Consequently, as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, the aggregate amount of the <I>Vioxx </I>Reserve was approximately
$98&nbsp;million, which is solely for future legal defense costs for the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation. Some of the
significant factors considered in the review of the <I>Vioxx </I>Reserve were as follows: the actual
costs incurred by the Company; the development of the Company&#146;s legal defense strategy and
structure in light of the scope of the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation, including the Settlement Agreement and the
expectation that certain lawsuits will continue to be pending; the number of cases being brought
against the Company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information
regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in
the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation. The amount of the <I>Vioxx </I>Reserve as of March&nbsp;31, 2010 represents the
Company&#146;s best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with
the remaining aspects of the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation; however, events such as additional trials in the
<I>Vioxx </I>Litigation and other events that could arise in the course of the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation could
affect the ultimate amount of defense costs to be incurred by the Company.

associated reserves and may determine to increase the <I>Vioxx </I>Reserve at any time in the future if,
based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Fosamax</I>

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously disclosed, Old Merck is a defendant in product liability lawsuits in the United
States involving <I>Fosamax </I>(the &#147;<I>Fosamax </I>Litigation&#148;). As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, approximately 1,039
cases, which include approximately 1,417 plaintiff groups, had been filed and were pending against
Old Merck in either federal or state court, including one case which seeks class action
certification, as well as damages and/or medical monitoring. In these actions, plaintiffs allege,
among other things, that they have suffered osteonecrosis of the jaw, generally subsequent to
invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction or dental implants and/or delayed healing, in
association with the use of <I>Fosamax</I>. In addition, plaintiffs in approximately seven percent of
these actions allege that they sustained stress and/or low energy femoral fractures in association
with the use of <I>Fosamax</I>. On August&nbsp;16, 2006, the JPML ordered that certain <I>Fosamax </I>product
liability cases pending in federal courts nationwide should be transferred and consolidated into
one multidistrict litigation (the &#147;<I>Fosamax </I>MDL&#148;) for coordinated pre-trial proceedings. The
<I>Fosamax </I>MDL has been transferred to Judge John Keenan in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York. As a result of the JPML order, approximately 799 of the cases are before
Judge Keenan. Judge Keenan issued a Case Management Order (and various amendments thereto) setting
forth a schedule governing the proceedings which focused primarily upon resolving the class action
certification motions in 2007 and completing fact discovery in an initial group of 25 cases by
October&nbsp;1, 2008. Briefing and argument on plaintiffs&#146; motions for certification of medical
monitoring classes were completed in 2007 and Judge Keenan issued an order denying the motions on
January&nbsp;3, 2008. On January&nbsp;28, 2008, Judge Keenan issued a further order dismissing with
prejudice all class claims asserted in the first four class action lawsuits filed against Old Merck
that sought personal injury damages and/or medical monitoring relief on a class wide basis. <I>Daubert</I>
motions were filed in May&nbsp;2009 and Judge Keenan conducted a <I>Daubert </I>hearing in July&nbsp;2009. On
July&nbsp;27, 2009, Judge Keenan issued his ruling on the parties&#146; respective <I>Daubert </I>motions. The
ruling denied the Plaintiff Steering Committee&#146;s motion and granted in part and denied in part Old
Merck&#146;s motion. The first MDL trial &#151; <I>Boles v. Merck </I>&#151; began on August&nbsp;11, 2009, and ended on
September&nbsp;2, 2009. On September&nbsp;11, 2009, the MDL court declared a mistrial in <I>Boles </I>because the
eight person jury could not reach a unanimous verdict and, consequently, the <I>Boles </I>case is set to
be retried on June&nbsp;2, 2010. The second MDL case set for trial &#151; <I>Flemings v. Merck </I>&#151; was scheduled
to start on January&nbsp;12, 2010, but Judge Keenan granted Old Merck&#146;s motion for summary judgment and
dismissed the case on November&nbsp;23, 2009. In the next MDL case set for trial &#151; <I>Maley v. Merck</I>
&#151; the trial commenced on April&nbsp;12, 2010 and went to the jury on May 5,
2010. On the same day, the jury returned a unanimous verdict in
Merck&#146;s favor. Old Merck filed a motion for summary judgment
in <I>Maley</I>, which the MDL court granted in part and denied in part on January&nbsp;27, 2010. On
February&nbsp;1, 2010, Judge Keenan selected a new bellwether case &#151; <I>Judith Graves v. Merck </I>&#151; to replace
the <I>Flemings </I>bellwether case, which the MDL court dismissed when it granted summary judgment in
favor of Old Merck. The MDL court has set the <I>Graves </I>trial to begin on September&nbsp;13, 2010. A
trial in Alabama was scheduled to begin on May&nbsp;3, 2010 but the trial court granted the parties&#146;
joint motion to postpone the trial date until the fall of 2010. A trial in Florida was scheduled
to begin on June&nbsp;21, 2010 but on April&nbsp;7, 2010 the Florida state court postponed the trial date
until sometime after January&nbsp;1, 2011.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, in July&nbsp;2008, an application was made by the Atlantic County Superior Court of
New Jersey requesting that all of the <I>Fosamax </I>cases pending in New Jersey be considered for mass
tort designation and centralized management before one judge in New Jersey. On October&nbsp;6, 2008,
the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered that all pending and future actions filed in New Jersey
arising out of the use of <I>Fosamax </I>and seeking damages for existing dental and jaw-related injuries,
including osteonecrosis of the jaw, but not solely seeking medical monitoring, be designated as a
mass tort for centralized management purposes before Judge Higbee in Atlantic County Superior
Court. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, approximately 219 cases were pending against Old Merck in the New
Jersey coordinated proceeding. On July&nbsp;20, 2009, Judge Higbee entered a Case Management Order (and
various amendments thereto) setting forth a schedule that contemplates completing fact discovery in
an initial group of 10 cases by March&nbsp;31, 2010, followed by expert discovery in four of those
cases, and a projected trial date of July&nbsp;12, 2010 for the first case to be tried in the New Jersey
coordinated proceeding. On April&nbsp;15, 2010, however, Judge Higbee advised that the first <I>Fosamax</I>
trial in the New Jersey coordinated proceeding will not occur until the fall of 2010 and set a
tentative trial date of September&nbsp;27, 2010.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company had a remaining reserve of approximately $38&nbsp;million
solely for its future legal defense costs for the <I>Fosamax </I>Litigation. During the first quarter of
2010, the Company spent approximately $6&nbsp;million and added $20&nbsp;million to its reserve.
Consequently, as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company had a reserve of approximately $52&nbsp;million solely
for its future legal defense costs for the <I>Fosamax </I>Litigation. Some of the significant factors
considered in the establishment of the reserve
for the <I>Fosamax </I>Litigation legal defense costs were as follows: the actual defense costs
incurred thus far; the development of the Company&#146;s legal defense strategy and structure in light
of the creation of the <I>Fosamax </I>MDL; the number of cases being brought against the Company; and the
anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities in the <I>Fosamax</I>
Litigation. The Company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy
of the associated reserves. Due to the uncertain nature of litigation, the Company is unable to
reasonably estimate its costs beyond the second quarter of 2011. The Company has not established
any reserves for any potential liability relating to the <I>Fosamax </I>Litigation. Unfavorable outcomes
in the <I>Fosamax </I>Litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position,
liquidity and results of operations.

Organon International (collectively, &#147;Organon&#148;), and the Company arising from Organon&#146;s marketing

in the Bergen County Superior Court of New Jersey before Judge Brian R. Martinotti. Three
additional cases are pending in various other state courts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The plaintiffs contend that Organon and Schering-Plough failed to adequately warn of the
alleged increased risk of venous thromboembolism (&#147;VTE&#148;) posed by <I>NuvaRing</I>, and/or downplayed the

violations of federal and state law, including fraud, Medicaid fraud and consumer protection
violations, among other claims. The outcome of these litigations and investigations could include
substantial damages, the imposition of substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or
administrative remedies. In 2002, the JPML ordered the transfer and consolidation of all pending
federal AWP cases to federal court in Boston, Massachusetts. Plaintiffs filed one consolidated
class action complaint, which aggregated the claims previously filed in various federal district
court actions and also expanded the number of manufacturers to include some which, like Old Merck,
had not been defendants in any prior pending case. In May&nbsp;2003, the court granted Old Merck&#146;s
motion to dismiss the consolidated class action and dismissed Old Merck from the class action case.
Old Merck and many other pharmaceutical manufacturers are defendants in similar complaints pending
in federal and state court including cases brought individually by a number of counties in the
State of New York. Fifty of the county cases have been consolidated in New York state court. Old
Merck was dismissed from the Suffolk County case, which was the first of the New York county cases
to be filed. In addition to the New York county cases, as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, Old Merck was a
defendant in state cases brought by the Attorneys General of eleven states, all of which are being
defended. In February&nbsp;2009, the Kansas Attorney General filed suit against Old Merck and several
other manufacturers. AWP claims brought by the Attorney General of Arizona against Old Merck were
dropped in 2009. The court in the AWP cases pending in Hawaii listed Old Merck and others to be

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2009,
Schering-Plough reached settlements of certain claims relating to AWP. In August&nbsp;2009,
Schering-Plough and five other pharmaceutical companies settled all claims brought on behalf of the
Alabama Medicaid program for a combined total of $89&nbsp;million. In addition, in July&nbsp;2009,
Schering-Plough reached a settlement with the Relator, acting on behalf of the United States in a
non-intervened AWP <I>qui tam </I>action pending in the U.S. Federal District Court of Massachusetts and
with the States of California and Florida for a combined total of $69&nbsp;million. That settlement
resolved all claims brought on behalf of the Medicaid programs for the
States of California and Florida and has been approved by the U.S. District Court for the
District of Massachusetts and held to be preclusive of all claims for the federal share of any
alleged Medicaid overpayment in all remaining states consistent with applicable precedent. In
January&nbsp;2010, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts held that a unit of
Schering-Plough and eight other drugmakers overcharged New York City and 42 New York counties for
certain generic drugs. The court has reserved the issue of damages and any penalties for future

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">companies announced that they reached
a civil settlement with the Attorneys General representing 35 states and the District of Columbia
to resolve a previously disclosed investigation by that group into whether the legacy companies
violated state consumer protection laws when marketing <I>Vytorin </I>and <I>Zetia</I>. As part of the
settlement, the legacy companies agreed to reimburse the investigative costs of the 35 states and
the District of Columbia which totaled $5.4&nbsp;million, and to make voluntary assurances of compliance
related to the promotion of <I>Vytorin </I>and <I>Zetia</I>. The settlement did not include any admission of
misconduct or liability by the legacy companies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously disclosed, the legacy companies have become aware of or been served with
approximately 145 civil class action lawsuits alleging common law and state consumer fraud claims
in connection with the MSP Partnership&#146;s sale and promotion of <I>Vytorin </I>and <I>Zetia</I>. Certain of those
lawsuits alleged personal injuries and/or sought medical monitoring. The lawsuits against Old
Merck and Schering-Plough were consolidated in a single multi-district litigation docket before
Judge Cavanaugh of the District of New Jersey, <I>In re Vytorin/Zetia Marketing Sales Practices and
Products Liability Litigation</I>. On August&nbsp;5, 2009, Old Merck and Schering-Plough jointly announced
that their cholesterol joint venture, entered into agreements to resolve, for a total fixed amount
of $41.5&nbsp;million, these civil class action lawsuits. The MSP Partnership recorded these charges in
the second quarter of 2009. On February&nbsp;9, 2010, Judge Cavanaugh granted final approval of the
settlements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Also, as previously disclosed, on April&nbsp;3, 2008, an Old Merck shareholder filed a putative
class action lawsuit in federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging that Old
Merck and its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Richard T. Clark, violated the
federal securities laws. This suit has since been withdrawn and re-filed in the District of New
Jersey and has been consolidated with another federal securities lawsuit under the caption <I>In re
Merck &#038; Co., Inc. Vytorin Securities Litigation</I>. An amended consolidated complaint was filed on
October&nbsp;6, 2008, and names as defendants Old Merck; Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals, LLC; and
certain of the Company&#146;s current and former officers and directors. Specifically, the complaint
alleges that Old Merck delayed releasing unfavorable results of the ENHANCE clinical trial
regarding the efficacy of <I>Vytorin </I>and that Old
Merck made false and misleading statements about expected earnings, knowing that once the
results of the <I>Vytorin </I>study were released, sales of <I>Vytorin </I>would decline and Old Merck&#146;s earnings
would suffer. On December&nbsp;12, 2008, Old Merck and the other defendants moved to dismiss this
lawsuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted.
On September&nbsp;2, 2009, the court issued an opinion and order denying the defendants&#146; motion to
dismiss this lawsuit, and on October&nbsp;19, 2009, Old Merck and the other defendants filed an answer
to the amended consolidated complaint. There is a similar consolidated, putative class action
securities lawsuit pending in the District of New Jersey, filed by a Schering-Plough shareholder
against Schering-Plough and its former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Fred
Hassan, under the caption <I>In re Schering-Plough Corporation/ENHANCE Securities Litigation</I>. The
amended consolidated complaint was filed on September&nbsp;15, 2008 and names as defendants
Schering-Plough, Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals, LLC; certain of the Company&#146;s current and
former officers and directors; and underwriters who participated in an August&nbsp;2007 public offering
of Schering-Plough&#146;s common and preferred stock. On December&nbsp;10, 2008, Schering-Plough and the
other defendants filed motions to dismiss this lawsuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to
state a claim for which relief can be granted. On September&nbsp;2, 2009, the court issued an opinion
and order denying the defendants&#146; motion to dismiss this lawsuit, and on September&nbsp;17, 2009, the
defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court&#146;s September&nbsp;2, 2009 opinion and order
denying the motion to dismiss. The motion for reconsideration was fully briefed on October&nbsp;13,
2009 and a decision remains pending. The defendants filed an answer to the consolidated amended

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously disclosed, on April&nbsp;22, 2008, a member of an Old Merck ERISA plan filed a
putative class action lawsuit against Old Merck and certain of the Company&#146;s current and former
officers and directors alleging they breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA. Since that time,
there have been other similar ERISA lawsuits filed against Old Merck in the District of New Jersey,
and all of those lawsuits have been consolidated under the caption <I>In re Merck &#038; Co., Inc. Vytorin
ERISA Litigation</I>. A consolidated amended complaint was filed on February&nbsp;5, 2009, and names as
defendants Old Merck and various current and former members of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors.
The plaintiffs allege that the ERISA plans&#146; investment in Old Merck stock was imprudent because Old
Merck&#146;s earnings are dependent on the commercial success of its cholesterol drug <I>Vytorin </I>and that
defendants knew or should have known that the results of a scientific study would cause the medical
community to turn to less expensive drugs for cholesterol management. On April&nbsp;23, 2009, Old Merck
and the other defendants moved to dismiss this lawsuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to
state a claim for which relief can be granted. On September&nbsp;1, 2009, the court issued an opinion
and order denying the defendants&#146; motion to dismiss this lawsuit. On November&nbsp;9, the plaintiffs
moved to strike certain of the defendants&#146; affirmative defenses. That motion was fully briefed on
December&nbsp;4, 2009 and is pending before the court.

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Following Schering-Plough&#146;s announcement on February&nbsp;15, 2001 that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) had been conducting inspections of its manufacturing facilities in New
Jersey and Puerto Rico and had issued reports citing deficiencies concerning compliance with
current Good Manufacturing Practices, and had delayed approval of <I>Clarinex</I>, several lawsuits were
filed against Schering-Plough and certain named officers. These lawsuits allege that the
defendants violated the federal securities law by allegedly failing to disclose material
information and making material misstatements. Specifically, they allege that Schering-Plough
failed to disclose an alleged serious risk that a new drug application for <I>Clarinex </I>would be
delayed as a result of these manufacturing issues, and they allege that the Company failed to
disclose the alleged depth and severity of its manufacturing issues. These complaints were
consolidated into one action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, and a
consolidated amended
complaint was filed on October&nbsp;11, 2001, purporting to represent a class of shareholders who
purchased shares of Schering-Plough stock from May&nbsp;9, 2000 through February&nbsp;15, 2001. The
complaint sought compensatory damages on behalf of the class. On February&nbsp;18, 2009, the court
signed an order preliminarily approving a settlement agreement under which Schering-Plough would
provide for a settlement fund in the amount of $165&nbsp;million to resolve all claims by the class,
which funds were placed in escrow at that time. The vast majority of the settlement was covered by
insurance. On December&nbsp;31, 2009, the District Court granted final approval of the settlement. The
appeal period from that final approval decision has expired.

breached their fiduciary obligations to certain participants in the Plan. The complaint seeks
damages in the amount of losses allegedly suffered by the Plan. The complaint was dismissed on
June&nbsp;29, 2004. The plaintiffs appealed. On August&nbsp;19, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit reversed the dismissal by the District Court and the matter has been remanded back to
the District Court for further proceedings. On September&nbsp;30, 2008, the District Court entered an
order granting in part, and denying in part, the named putative class representative&#146;s motion for
class certification. Schering-Plough thereafter petitioned the U.S. District Court of Appeals for

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June&nbsp;1997 and January&nbsp;1998, Schering-Plough settled patent litigation with Upsher-Smith,
Inc. (&#147;Upsher-Smith&#148;) and ESI Lederle, Inc. (&#147;Lederle&#148;), respectively, relating to generic versions
of K-DUR, Schering-Plough&#146;s long-acting potassium chloride product supplement used by cardiac
patients, for which Lederle and Upsher-Smith had filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications
(&#147;ANDA&#146;s&#148;). Following the commencement of an administrative proceeding by the United States
Federal Trade Commission (the &#147;FTC&#148;) alleging anti-competitive effects from those settlements
(which has been resolved in Schering-Plough&#146;s favor), alleged class action suits were filed in
federal and state courts on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of K-DUR against
Schering-Plough, Upsher-Smith and Lederle. These suits claim violations of federal and state
antitrust laws, as well as other state statutory and common law causes of action. These suits seek
unspecified damages. In February&nbsp;2009, a special master recommended that the U.S. District Court
for the District of New Jersey dismiss the class action lawsuits on summary judgment and in March
2010, the District Court adopted the recommendation, granted summary judgment to the defendants,
and dismissed the matter in its entirety. In April&nbsp;2010, plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously disclosed, Old Merck is a party to individual and class action product liability
lawsuits and claims in the United States involving pediatric vaccines (e.g., hepatitis B vaccine)
that contained thimerosal, a preservative used in vaccines. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, there were
approximately 200 thimerosal related lawsuits pending in which Old Merck is a defendant, although
the vast majority of those lawsuits are not currently active. Other defendants include other
vaccine manufacturers who produced pediatric vaccines containing thimerosal as well as
manufacturers of thimerosal. In these actions, the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that
they have suffered neurological injuries as a result of exposure to thimerosal from pediatric
vaccines. There are no cases currently scheduled for trial. The Company will defend against these
lawsuits; however, it is possible that unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on
the Company&#146;s financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Old Merck has been successful in having cases of this type either dismissed or stayed on the
ground that the action is prohibited under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (the &#147;Vaccine
Act&#148;). The Vaccine Act prohibits any person from filing or maintaining a civil action (in state or
federal court) seeking damages against a vaccine manufacturer for vaccine-related injuries unless a
petition is first filed in the United States Court of Federal Claims (hereinafter the &#147;Vaccine
Court&#148;). Under the Vaccine Act, before filing a civil action against a vaccine manufacturer, the
petitioner must either (a)&nbsp;pursue his or her petition to conclusion in Vaccine Court and then
timely file an election to proceed with a civil action in lieu of accepting the Vaccine Court&#146;s
adjudication of the petition or (b)&nbsp;timely exercise a right to withdraw the petition prior to
Vaccine Court adjudication in accordance with certain statutorily prescribed time periods. Old
Merck is not a party to Vaccine Court proceedings because the petitions are brought against the
United States Department of Health and Human Services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is aware that there are approximately 5,000 cases pending in the Vaccine Court
involving allegations that thimerosal-containing vaccines and/or the <I>M-M-R </I>II vaccine cause autism
spectrum disorders. Not all of the thimerosal-containing vaccines involved in the Vaccine Court
proceeding are Company vaccines. The Company is the sole source of the <I>M-M-R </I>II vaccine
domestically. The Special Masters presiding over the Vaccine Court proceedings held hearings in
three test cases involving the theory that the combination of <I>M-M-R </I>II vaccine and thimerosal in
vaccines causes autism spectrum disorders. On February&nbsp;12, 2009, the Special Masters issued
decisions in each of those cases, finding that the theory was unsupported by valid scientific
evidence and that the petitioners in the three cases were therefore not entitled to compensation.
Two of those three cases are currently on appeal. The Special Masters held similar hearings in
three different test cases involving the theory that thimerosal in vaccines alone causes autism
spectrum disorders. On March&nbsp;12, 2010, the Special Masters issued decisions in this second set of
test cases, finding that the theory was also unsupported by valid scientific evidence and that the
petitions in these cases were also not entitled to compensation. Decisions have not been issued in
this second set of test cases. The Special Masters had previously indicated that they would hold
similar hearings involving the theory that <I>M-M-R </I>II alone causes autism spectrum disorders, but
they have stated that they no longer intend to do so. The Vaccine Court has indicated that it
intends to use the evidence presented at these test case hearings to guide the adjudication of the
remaining autism spectrum disorder cases.

FDA seeking to market in the United States generic forms of Nexium<I>, Singulair</I>, <I>Emend, Cancidas </I>and
<I>Atripla, </I>respectively<I>, </I>prior to the expiration of Old Merck&#146;s (and AstraZeneca&#146;s in the case of

the FDA seeking to market in the United States a generic form of <I>Vytorin</I>, both prior to the
expiration of Schering-Plough&#146;s patent concerning those products. The generic companies&#146; ANDA&#146;s
generally include allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of the patents.
The Company has filed patent infringement suits in federal court against companies filing ANDA&#146;s
for generic  montelukast (<I>Singulair</I>), aprepitant (<I>Emend</I>) and caspofungin

Bristol-Myers Squibb (&#147;BMS&#148;) and the Company have filed a patent infringement lawsuit against a
generic company for filing an ANDA for generic <I>Atripla</I>. The Company intends to  defend
its patents, which it believes are valid, against infringement by generic companies attempting to
market products prior to the expiration dates of such patents. As with any litigation, there can
be no assurance of the outcomes, which, if adverse, could result in significantly shortened periods
of exclusivity for these products.

disclosed, the Company entered into settlement agreements in both lawsuits. On March&nbsp;24, 2010,
Judge Cavanaugh of the District Court for the District of New Jersey approved the settlement of the
federal action, which was brought against Schering-Plough and its directors. Objectors to that
settlement, all of whom objected only to the amount of legal fees being paid to the plaintiffs,
have until May&nbsp;16, 2010, to appeal that ruling. In the other lawsuit, which is in the New Jersey
Superior Court in Hunterdon County, New Jersey and is against Old Merck, its directors along with

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Based on a complaint to the French competition authority from a competitor in France and
pursuant to a court order, the French competition authority has obtained documents from a French
subsidiary of the Company relating to <I>Subutex</I>, one of the products that the subsidiary markets and
sells. Any resolution of this matter adverse to the French subsidiary could result in the
imposition of civil fines and injunctive or administrative remedies. On July&nbsp;17, 2007, the Juge
des Libert&#233;s et de la D&#233;tention ordered the annulment of the search and seizure on procedural
grounds. On July&nbsp;19, 2007, the French authority appealed the order to the French Supreme Court.
On May&nbsp;20, 2009, the French Supreme Court overturned that annulment and remanded the case to the
Paris Court of Appeal on the basis that the Juge des Libert&#233;s et de la D&#233;tention had not examined
each document to assess whether it should have been seized and whether it had been lawfully seized.
On March&nbsp;4, 2010, the Paris Court of Appeal confirmed the validity of the seizure&#146;s operations.
On March&nbsp;10, 2010, Schering-Plough S.A.S. lodged an appeal before the Supreme Court.

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There are various other legal proceedings, principally product liability and intellectual
property suits involving the Company, that are pending. While it is not feasible to predict the
outcome of such proceedings or the proceedings discussed in this Item, in the opinion of the
Company, all such proceedings are either adequately covered by insurance or, if not so covered,
should not ultimately result in any liability that would have a material adverse effect on the
financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the Company, other than proceedings for
which a separate assessment is provided in this Item.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Item&nbsp;4. Controls and Procedures</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Management of the Company, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and
procedures over financial reporting. For the three
months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010, management has concluded that there were no changes that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the internal control over
financial reporting. Based on this assessment, as of the end of the period
covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. As previously disclosed, effective April&nbsp;2010, several of the Company&#146;s U.S.
operating units implemented an enterprise wide resource planning system (SAP)&nbsp;which included
modifications to the design and operation of controls over financial reporting. The Company is
monitoring the status of the business and financial operations with respect to the implementation
of the enterprise wide resource planning system and believes that an effective control environment
is being maintained. The Company also is moving forward with its plans to integrate the business
operations of the legacy companies including evaluating if any changes to the control environment
over financial reporting are required.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">This report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the
Company may contain so-called &#147;forward-looking statements,&#148; all of which are based on management&#146;s
current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ
materially from those set forth in the statements. One can identify these forward-looking
statements by their use of words such as &#147;expects,&#148; &#147;plans,&#148; &#147;will,&#148; &#147;estimates,&#148; &#147;forecasts,&#148;
&#147;projects&#148; and other words of similar meaning. One can also identify them by the fact that they do
not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to address the
Company&#146;s growth strategy, financial results, product development, product approvals, product
potential and development programs. One must carefully consider any such statement and should
understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company&#146;s
forward-looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of
other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. No
forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. One
should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors, including risk factors, described in
the Company&#146;s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, especially on Forms 10-K, 10-Q
and 8-K. In Item&nbsp;1A. &#147;Risk Factors&#148; of the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009, as filed on March&nbsp;1, 2010, the Company discusses in more detail various
important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. The
Company notes these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. One should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such
factors. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of
all potential risks or uncertainties.
