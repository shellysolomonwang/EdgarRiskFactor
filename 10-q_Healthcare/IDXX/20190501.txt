Item 1A. Risk Factors” described in our 2018 Annual Report and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as those described from time to time in our other periodic reports filed with the SEC.Any forward-looking statements represent our estimates only as of the day this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was filed with the SEC and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements may also be included in other materials released to the public. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates or expectations change. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our 2018 Annual Report that includes additional information about us, our results of operations, our financial position, and our cash flows, and with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Business Overview  We develop, manufacture, and distribute products and provide services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock, poultry and dairy, and water testing markets. We also sell a line of portable electrolytes and blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market. Our primary products and services are:•Point-of-care veterinary diagnostic products, comprising instruments, consumables, and rapid assay test kits;•Veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services;•Practice management and diagnostic imaging systems and services used by veterinaries;•Health monitoring, biological materials testing, laboratory diagnostic instruments and services used by the biomedical research community;•Diagnostic, health-monitoring products for livestock, poultry, and dairy;•Products that test water for certain microbiological contaminants;•Point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers used in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market.Operating Segments. We operate primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”) and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and improve dairy reproductive efficiency, which we refer to as Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (“LPD”). Our Other operating segment combines and presents products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market (“OPTI Medical”) with our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. CAG develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes products and performs services for veterinarians and the biomedical analytics market, primarily related to diagnostics and information management. Water develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological parameters in water. LPD develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes diagnostic tests and related software and performs services that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve bovine reproductive efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food. OPTI Medical manufactures and distributes point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human medical diagnostics market.27Certain costs are not allocated to our operating segments and are instead reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” These costs include costs that do not align with one of our existing operating segments or are cost prohibitive to allocate, which primarily consist of our R&D function, regional or country expenses, certain foreign currency revaluation and settlement gains and losses on monetary balances in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currency and unusual items. Corporate support function costs (such as information technology, facilities, human resources, finance and legal), health benefits and incentive compensation are charged to our business segments at pre-determined budgeted amounts or rates. Differences from these pre-determined budgeted amounts or rates are also captured within Unallocated Amounts.Effects of Certain Factors and Trends on Results of Operations  Currency Impact. See “Part I. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.Other Items. See “Part I. Item 1. Business - Patents and Licenses” and “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our 2018 Annual Report for additional information regarding distributor purchasing and inventories, economic conditions, and patent expiration.Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The critical accounting policies and the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2019, are consistent with those discussed in our 2018 Annual Report in the section under the heading “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions.” Recent Accounting Pronouncements For more information regarding the impact of recent accounting standards and amendments will have on our consolidated financial statements as described in Note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth, and references in this analysis and discussion to “revenue,” “revenues” or “revenue growth” are references to “organic revenue growth.” Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period for the prior year, net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, certain business acquisitions, and divestitures. Organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, or as a superior measure to, revenues reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers.We exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control, are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable prior year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period. We also exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of certain business acquisitions and divestitures because the nature, size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period, and because they either require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction, and therefore can also obscure underlying business and 28operating trends. We exclude only acquisitions that are considered to be a business from organic revenue growth. In a business combination, if substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets, we do not consider these assets to be a business and include these acquisitions in organic revenue growth. A typical acquisition that we do not consider a business is a customer list asset acquisition, which does not have all elements necessary to operate a business, such as employees or infrastructure. We believe the efforts required to convert and retain these acquired customers are similar in nature to our existing customer base and therefore are included in organic revenue growth. We also use Adjusted EBITDA, gross debt, net debt, gross debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures that should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, financial measures presented according to U.S. GAAP. Management believes that reporting these non-GAAP financial measures provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate our business performance and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility. Comparison to Prior PeriodsOur fiscal quarter ended on March 31. Unless otherwise stated, the analysis and discussion of our financial condition and results of operations below, including references to growth and organic growth and increases and decreases, are being compared to the equivalent prior year period.29Results of OperationsThree Months Ended March 31, 2019, Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Total Company.

The increase in both U.S. and international organic revenues was driven by strong volume gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies and expanded commercial organization that are driving increased volumes from new and existing customers in our reference laboratory business and the impact of the continued expansion of our CAG Diagnostics instrument installed base. Our Water business also contributed to our international growth, primarily from higher sales volumes of our Colilert test products and related accessories. The impact of currency movements decreased revenue by 2.8%. 30The following table presents total Company results of operations:﻿ For the Three Months Ended March 31, ChangeTotal Company - Results of Operations(dollars in thousands) 2019 Percent of Revenue 2018 Percent of Revenue Amount Percentage﻿            Revenues $576,056   $537,656   $38,400 7.1%Cost of revenue 244,459   234,557   9,902 4.2%Gross profit 331,597 57.6% 303,099 56.4% 28,498 9.4%﻿            Operating Expenses:            Sales and marketing 106,584 18.5% 100,101 18.6% 6,483 6.5%General and administrative 60,361 10.5% 60,931 11.3% (570) (0.9%)Research and development 31,514 5.5% 29,023 5.4% 2,491 8.6%Total operating expenses 198,459 34.5% 190,055 35.3% 8,404 4.4%Income from operations $133,138 23.1% $113,044 21.0% $20,094 17.8%Gross Profit. Gross profit increased due to higher sales volumes and a 120 basis point increase in the gross profit percentage. The increase in the gross profit percentage was driven by several factors, including the net benefit of price increases in our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio, mix benefits from high growth in VetLab consumable revenues, volume leverage and productivity benefits in our U.S. reference laboratory services, and the favorable impact of lower product costs in our CAG and LPD businesses. The impact from foreign currency movements increased gross profit margin by approximately 10 basis points, including the impact of hedge gains in the current year, as compared to hedge losses in the prior year.Operating Expenses. The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to increased personnel-related costs from our expanded global commercial infrastructure. The decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to lower corporate function costs, including certain information technology projects that will occur later in the year. Research and development expense increased primarily due to higher project and personnel-related costs. The changes in currency exchange rates decreased total operating expenses within our segments, which was offset by foreign exchange losses on settlements of foreign currency denominated transactions recorded within Unallocated Amounts, resulting in approximately a 2% decrease to our overall operating expenses.31Companion Animal GroupThe following table presents revenue by product and service category for CAG: ໿໿  For the Three Months Ended March 31,      Net Revenue(dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 Dollar Change Reported Revenue Growth(1) Percentage Change from Currency Percentage Change from Acquisitions Organic Revenue Growth(1)﻿              CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue: $443,791 $406,048 $37,743 9.3 % (2.6%) — 11.9 %IDEXX VetLab consumables 167,211 149,513 17,698 11.8 % (3.1%) — 15.0 %Rapid assay products 54,431 52,017 2,414 4.6 % (1.4%) — 6.1 %Reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services 202,658 186,937 15,721 8.4 % (2.4%) — 10.8 %CAG diagnostics services and accessories 19,491 17,581 1,910 10.9 % (3.7%) — 14.6 %CAG Diagnostics capital - instruments 28,749 30,895 (2,146) (6.9%) (3.5%) — (3.4%)Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems 36,378 33,890 2,488 7.3 % (0.6%) 2.2% 5.8 %Net CAG revenue $508,918 $470,833 $38,085 8.1 % (2.5%) 0.2% 10.5 %(1) Reported revenue growth and organic revenue growth may not recalculate due to roundingCAG Diagnostics Recurring Revenue. The increase in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue was primarily due to increased volumes in IDEXX VetLab consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic services, and to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenue growth was primarily due to higher sales volumes across all regions for our Catalyst consumables, including SDMA consumables, and to a lesser extent, Procyte Dx® consumables and Sedivue Dx® analyzer pay-per-run sales. These increases were supported by expansion of our instrument installed base, growth in testing by new and existing customers, our expanded menu of available tests, and to a lesser extent, benefits from higher average unit sales prices, and customer stocking in the U.K ahead of the planned exit from the European Union.The increase in rapid assay revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of canine SNAP® 4Dx Plus and to a lesser extent, higher realized prices.  The increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was primarily due to the impact of higher testing volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories, most prominently in the U.S., resulting from increased testing from new and existing customers, supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies, such as IDEXX SDMA™ and fecal antigen testing. The increase was also the result of higher average unit sales prices. CAG Diagnostics services and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments.CAG Diagnostics Capital – Instruments Revenue. The decrease in instrument revenue reflects slightly lower overall instrument placements as well as the impact of product mix, including lower SediVue Dx analyzer placements compared to high prior year levels, partially offset by higher Procyte Dx analyzer placements, and higher Catalyst analyzer placements.  32Veterinary Software, Services and Diagnostic Imaging Systems Revenue. The increase in revenue was primarily due to increased veterinary software, subscription, and services, as well as higher realized prices on these service offerings, and to a lesser extent, higher diagnostic imaging services as a result of the increase in our active installed base. These increases were partially offset by lower diagnostic imaging system placements compared to high prior year levels. Our acquisition of a software company in the second half of 2018 contributed 2.2% to reported revenue growth.The following table presents the CAG segment results of operations:﻿ For the Three Months Ended March 31, ChangeResults of Operations(dollars in thousands) 2019 Percent of Revenue 2018 Percent of Revenue Amount Percentage             Revenues $508,918   $470,833   $38,085 8.1%Cost of revenues 221,430   208,900   12,530 6.0%Gross profit 287,488 56.5% 261,933 55.6% 25,555 9.8%﻿            Operating Expenses:            Sales and marketing 96,819 19.0% 89,106 18.9% 7,713 8.7%General and administrative 52,311 10.3% 51,135 10.9% 1,176 2.3%Research and development 23,336 4.6% 21,294 4.5% 2,042 9.6%Total operating expenses 172,466 33.9% 161,535 34.3% 10,931 6.8%Income from operations $115,022 22.6% $100,398 21.3% $14,624 14.6%Gross Profit. Gross profit increased primarily due to higher sales volume as well as a 90 basis point increase in the gross profit percentage. The increase in gross profit percentage was driven by the net benefit of price increases in our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio, mix benefits from high growth in VetLab consumable revenues, scale and productivity gains in U.S. reference laboratory services, and the favorable impact of lower product costs. The impact from foreign currency movements had an immaterial impact on gross profit margin. Operating Expenses. The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to increased personnel-related costs related to our expanded global commercial infrastructure. The increase in general and administrative expense was the result of higher personnel-related costs. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to higher project costs and increased personnel-related costs. The overall change in currency exchange rates decreased operating expenses by approximately 3%.33WaterThe following table presents the Water segment results of operations:﻿ For the Three Months Ended March 31, ChangeResults of Operations(dollars in thousands) 2019 Percent of Revenue 2018 Percent of Revenue Amount Percentage             Revenues $30,310   $29,143   $1,167 4.0 %Cost of revenue 8,171   8,781   (610) (6.9%)Gross profit 22,139 73.0% 20,362 69.9% 1,777 8.7 %﻿            Operating Expenses:            Sales and marketing 3,995 13.2% 4,065 13.9% (70) (1.7%)General and administrative 3,314 10.9% 3,188 10.9% 126 4.0 %Research and development 1,048 3.5% 647 2.2% 401 62.0 %Total operating expenses 8,357 27.6% 7,900 27.1% 457 5.8 %Income from operations $13,782 45.5% $12,462 42.8% $1,320 10.6 %Revenue. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the benefit of price increases and higher sales volumes of our Colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and E. coli testing, including strong volume growth rates in our Latin America and Asia Pacific regions, as well as customer stocking in the U.K ahead of the planned exit from the European Union. The impact of currency movements decreased revenue by approximately 4.0%. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased due to higher sales volumes as well as a 310 basis point increase in the gross profit percentage. The increase in the gross profit percentage was primarily due to the decreases in manufacturing costs and net benefit of price increases, partially offset by higher distribution costs. The impact from foreign currency movements increased our gross profit percentage by approximately 90 basis points, including the impact of hedge gains in the current year, as compared to hedge losses in the prior year.Operating Expenses. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses and increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the realignment of certain personnel within operating expense categories. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to personnel-related costs. The overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in operating expenses of approximately 3%.34Livestock, Poultry and Dairy The following table presents the LPD segment results of operations:﻿ For the Three Months Ended March 31, ChangeResults of Operations(dollars in thousands) 2019 Percent of Revenue 2018 Percent of Revenue Amount Percentage﻿            Revenues $31,506   $32,240   $(734) (2.3%)Cost of revenue 12,467   14,593   (2,126) (14.6%)Gross profit 19,039 60.4% 17,647 54.7% 1,392 7.9%﻿            Operating Expenses:            Sales and marketing 5,281 16.8% 6,614 20.5% (1,333) (20.2%)General and administrative 4,465 14.2% 4,910 15.2% (445) (9.1%)Research and development 3,043 9.7% 3,162 9.8% (119) (3.8%)Total operating expenses 12,789 40.6% 14,686 45.6% (1,897) (12.9%)Income from operations $6,250 19.8% $2,961 9.2% $3,289 111.1%Revenue. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements that decreased revenue by approximately 6.3%, as well as a decline in European bovine testing programs, lower diagnostic testing related to African swine fever outbreaks in China, and lower dairy sales impacted by low milk prices. These decreases were partially offset by increased herd health screening, poultry testing volumes in our Asia Pacific region, and higher pregnancy testing in our European and Asia Pacific regions.Gross Profit. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher herd health screening volumes and a 5.7% increase in the gross profit percentage. The gross profit percentage increase was primarily due to lower product manufacturing costs and favorable product mix. The impact from foreign currency movements increased gross profit margin by approximately 130 basis points, including the impact of hedge gains in the current year, as compared to hedge losses in the prior year.Operating Expenses. The decreases in operating expenses were due to lower personnel-related costs, primarily due to open positions. The overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in operating expenses of approximately 4%.35OtherThe following table presents the Other results of operations:໿﻿ For the Three Months Ended March 31, ChangeResults of Operations(dollars in thousands) 2019 Percent of Revenue 2018 Percent of Revenue Amount Percentage﻿            Revenues $5,322   $5,440   $(118) (2.2%)Cost of revenue 2,595   3,366   (771) (22.9%)Gross profit 2,727 51.2% 2,074 38.1% 653 31.5%﻿            Operating Expenses:            Sales and marketing 347 6.5% 520 9.6% (173) (33.3%)General and administrative 345 6.5% 804 14.8% (459) (57.1%)Research and development 509 9.6% 252 4.6% 257 102.0%Total operating expenses 1,201 22.6% 1,576 29.0% (375) (23.8%)Income from operations $1,526 28.7% $498 9.2% $1,028 206.4%Revenue. The decrease in revenue was due to lower volumes of our OPTI Medical analyzers and related consumables, mostly offset by higher royalties associated with intellectual property related to our former pharmaceutical product line, and to a lesser extent higher realized prices on our OPTI Medical products and services. The impact of currency movements on revenue was immaterial. Gross Profit. The increase in gross profit was due to a 13.1% increase in the gross profit percentage primarily due to favorable product mix from higher royalties, as well as price increases on OPTI Medical products and services and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher service and distribution expense. The overall change in currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on the gross profit percentage.Operating Expenses. The decrease in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to lower personnel-related costs. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the recovery of previously established bad debt reserves in Africa and the Middle East. The increase in research and development costs was primarily due to higher personnel-related and project costs.36Unallocated AmountsThe following table presents the Unallocated Amounts results of operations:﻿ For the Three Months Ended March 31, ChangeResults of Operations(dollars in thousands) 2019   2018   Amount Percentage﻿            Revenues $—   $—   $— —Cost of revenue (204)   (1,083)   879 (81.2%)Gross profit 204   1,083   (879) (81.2%)﻿            Operating Expenses:            Sales and marketing 142   (204)   346 (169.6%)General and administrative (74)   894   (968) (108.3%)Research and development 3,578   3,668   (90) (2.5%)Total operating expenses 3,646   4,358   (712) (16.3%)Loss from operations $(3,442)   $(3,275)   $(167) 5.1%Unallocated Amounts. The change in unallocated amounts was due to higher foreign exchange losses on settlements of foreign currency denominated transactions compared to gains in the prior period, as well as higher unallocated employee benefit and incentive costs. These impacts were offset by lower unallocated corporate function costs, including certain information technology projects that will occur later in the year. Non-Operating ItemsInterest Income. Interest income was $0.04 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to the liquidation of our portfolio of marketable securities during the first quarter of 2018.Interest Expense. Interest expense was $8.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $9.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in interest expense was the result of lower average debt levels, offset by higher interest rates. We also realized lower interest expense from the benefit of our cross currency swaps, as well as increased capitalized interest related to the expansion of our Westbrook, Maine headquarters and relocation of our core reference laboratory in Germany. Provision for Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 17.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to 14.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily related to lower tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by a nonrecurring item recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2018, that resulted from the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act.37Liquidity and Capital Resources  Liquidity  We fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, proceeds from long-term senior note financings, and amounts available under our Credit Facility. At March 31, 2019, we had $116.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $123.8 million on December 31, 2018. Working capital, including our Credit Facility, totaled $8.0 million at March 31, 2019, as compared to negative $116.3 million at December 31, 2018. Additionally, at March 31, 2019, we had remaining borrowing availability of $501.7 million under our $850 million Credit Facility. We believe that, if necessary, we could obtain additional borrowings at similar rates to our existing borrowings to fund our growth objectives. We further believe that current cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operations, and committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital purchase requirements, and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months. We believe that these resources, coupled with our ability, as needed, to obtain additional financing on favorable terms will also be sufficient to fund our business as currently conducted for the foreseeable future. We may enter into new financing arrangements or refinance or retire existing debt in the future depending on market conditions. Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, we could elect to raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in increased interest expense or other dilution of our earnings.We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries. Our foreign cash and marketable securities are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the U.S. The following table presents cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held domestically and by our foreign subsidiaries at March 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018:໿Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities(dollars in thousands) March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018﻿    U.S. $2,632 $2,044Foreign 113,984 121,750Total $116,616 $123,794﻿    Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in U.S. dollars by our foreign subsidiaries $3,785 $11,119﻿    Percentage of total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in U.S. dollars by our foreign subsidiaries 3.2% 9.0%Of the $116.6 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of March 31, 2019, greater than 99% was held as bank deposits.

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $0.5 million was driven primarily by the changes in our operating assets and liabilities, offset by the increase in net income. The following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities: ໿﻿ For the Three Months Ended March 31,(dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 Dollar Change﻿      Accounts receivable $(33,421) $(21,800) $(11,621)Inventories (14,521) (8,070) (6,451)Accounts payable 699 (1,939) 2,638Deferred revenue (3,098) (1,327) (1,771)Other assets and liabilities (49,601) (52,302) 2,701Total change in cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities $(99,942) $(85,438) $(14,504) Cash used due to changes in operating assets and liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in the prior year, increased approximately $14.5 million primarily due to the impact of our cash used for the increase in accounts receivable as a result of revenue growth, and cash used by increases in inventory driven by timing of inventory receipts. We have historically experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vector-borne disease testing, which has historically resulted in significant increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year.Investing Activities. Cash used by investing activities was $38.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $260.3 million for the same period in the prior year. This change in investing cash activity was primarily due to the sale of marketable securities in 2018, as a result of our repatriation of cash and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries, as well as increased capital spending as we expand our Westbrook, Maine headquarters and relocate our core reference laboratory in Germany. Financing Activities. Cash used by financing activities was $2.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to cash used by financing activities of $325.0 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in cash used by financing activities was due to a larger repayment on our revolving Credit Facility in 2018 from repatriated foreign cash, an issuance of $100 million senior notes during the first quarter of 2019, and a decrease in repurchases of our common stock in the current period as compared to the same period in the prior year. Cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock decreased $29.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in the prior year. We believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our stockholders and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing 39activities and the share price. See Note 10 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information about our share repurchases.Net borrowing and repayment activity under our Credit Facility resulted in cash used of $52.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $247.5 million of cash used in the same period of the prior year. At March 31, 2019, we had $347.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The general availability of funds under our Credit Facility was further reduced by $1.3 million for a letter of credit that was issued in connection with claims under our workers’ compensation policy. The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative, and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations. The obligations under our Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the failure to pay specified indebtedness, cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness and a change of control default.On March 14, 2019, we amended our Existing Agreement with MetLife, submitted a request for purchase and drew $100 million of our Shelf Notes at 4.19% interest per annum rate, due March 14, 2029 (the "Series C Notes"). Series C Notes proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including a partial repayment of our Credit Facility.Since December 2013, we have issued and sold through private placements senior notes having an aggregate principal amount of approximately $700 million, including the $100 million Series C Notes, pursuant to certain note purchase agreements (collectively, the “Senior Note Agreements”). The Senior Note Agreements contain affirmative, negative, and financial covenants customary for agreements of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of our subsidiaries, priority indebtedness, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations.Should we elect to prepay the senior notes, such aggregate prepayment will include the applicable make-whole amount(s), as defined within the applicable Senior Note Agreements. Additionally, in the event of a change in control of the Company or upon the disposition of certain assets of the Company the proceeds of which are not reinvested (as defined in the Senior Note Agreements), we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the senior notes. The obligations under the senior notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the applicable Senior Note Agreements, each of which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the failure to pay specified indebtedness and cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness.Effect of Currency Translation on Cash. The net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are related to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. These changes will fluctuate for each period presented as the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the value of the foreign currencies changes. A currency’s value depends on many factors, including interest rates and the country’s debt levels and strength of economy.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements or variable interest entities, except for letters of credit and third-party guarantees.40Financial Covenant. The sole financial covenant of our Credit Facility and Senior Note Agreements is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other non-cash charges (“Adjusted EBITDA”) not to exceed 3.5-to-1. At March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with such covenant. The following details our consolidated leverage ratio calculation as of March 31, 2019:໿ Twelve months endedTrailing 12 Months Adjusted EBITDA:March 31, 2019﻿ Net income attributable to stockholders (as reported)$390,261Interest expense33,856Provision for income taxes87,905Depreciation and amortization83,729Share-based compensation expense25,531Extraordinary and other non-recurring non-cash charges2,629Adjusted EBITDA$623,911﻿ ﻿ Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio:March 31, 2019﻿ Line of credit$346,998Long-term debt699,334Total debt1,046,332Acquisition-related contingent consideration payable4,507Financing leases220Deferred financing costs497Gross debt1,051,556Gross debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio1.69﻿ Less: Cash and cash equivalents(116,616)Net debt$934,940Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio1.50Adjusted EBITDA, gross debt, net debt, gross debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio are non-GAAP financial measures which should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, financial measures presented according to U.S. GAAP. Management believes that reporting these non-GAAP financial measures provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate our business performance and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility. Other Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees  Significant commitments, contingencies and guarantees at March 31, 2019, are described in Note 14 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 41Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see the section under the heading “Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk” of our 2018 Annual Report. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the market risks described in our 2018 Annual Report, except for the impact of foreign exchange rates, as discussed below. Foreign Currency Exchange Impacts. Approximately 21% of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local currencies for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to 22% for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally, and a weakening of the U.S. dollar has the opposite effect. Similarly, to the extent that the U.S. dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods, our growth rate will be negatively affected. The impact of foreign currency denominated costs and expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure. Additionally, our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues.Our foreign currency exchange impacts are comprised of three components: 1) local currency revenues and expenses; 2) the impact of hedge contracts; and 3) intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary. Based on projected revenues and expenses for the remainder of 2019, excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies, we project a 1% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would reduce revenue by approximately $6 million and operating income by approximately $3 million. Additionally, we project our foreign currency hedge contracts in place as of March 31, 2019, would result in incremental offsetting gains of approximately $1 million. The impact of the intercompany and trade balances, and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded, as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have on such balances.At our current foreign currency exchange rate assumptions, we anticipate the effect of a stronger U.S. dollar for the remainder of the year will have an unfavorable impact on our operating results by decreasing our revenues, operating profit, and diluted earnings per share for the year ending December 31, 2019, by approximately $38 million, $3 million, and $0.03 per share, respectively. This unfavorable currency impact includes a favorable impact of approximately $12 million from foreign currency hedging activity. The actual impact of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we transact may materially differ from our expectations described above. The above estimates assume that the value of the U.S. dollar will reflect the euro at $1.11, the British pound at $1.29, the Canadian dollar at $0.74, and the Australian dollar at $0.71; and the Japanese yen at ¥112, the Chinese renminbi at RMB 6.79 and the Brazilian real at R$3.88 relative to the U.S. dollar for the remainder of 2019.The following table presents the foreign currency exchange impact on our revenues, operating profit, and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, as compared to the respective prior period:໿﻿For the Three Months EndedMarch 31,(dollars in thousands)2019 2018﻿   Revenue impact$(15,119) $17,816﻿   Operating profit impact, excluding hedge activity$(6,964) $7,142﻿   Hedge losses (gains) - prior year1,835 (1,075)Hedge gains (losses) - current year1,411 (1,835)Hedging activity impact3,246 (2,910)﻿   Operating profit impact, including hedge activity$(3,718) $4,232Diluted earnings per share impact, including hedge activity$(0.03) $0.0442Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by the SEC in its Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures at March 31, 2019, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended March 31, 2019, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  PART II — OTHER INFORMATION  Item 1. Legal ProceedingsDue to the nature of our activities, we are at times subject to pending and threatened legal actions that arise out of the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, based in part upon advice of legal counsel, the disposition of any such currently pending matters is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, it is possible that our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more legal actions.Item 1A. Risk Factors  In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2018 Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2018 Annual Report. The risks described in our 2018 Annual Report are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or future results.43Item 2.
