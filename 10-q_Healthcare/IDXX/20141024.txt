Item 1A. Risk Factors        In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our 2013 Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2013 Annual Report, except for the additional risk factor set forth below. The risks described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our 2013 Annual Report are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.       Uncertainties in Executing a Recently Announced All-Direct Sales Strategy in the U.S. Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations, and this New Strategy May Not Be Successful       On July 25, 2014, we announced our plan to transition to an all-direct sales strategy for our rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables (“kits and consumables”) in the U.S. effective January 1, 2015. Successfully executing this plan will require us to concurrently achieve a number of key objectives in a relatively short period of time, including, among other things, successfully recruiting, retaining and training additional personnel in key positions (such as sales, marketing and customer support) and developing or enhancing the necessary operational, logistics and systems support for an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. Implementation of the new strategy will require us to incur additional transitional cost and expense in 2014 and will result in the drawdown of distributor inventory in 2014 and potentially in early 2015. These transitional costs and expenses and inventory drawdown are expected to negatively affect our earnings during these periods. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be wholly successful in our efforts, and if we are delayed or otherwise unable to effectively implement and support the new strategy, our results of operations may be negatively impacted. We also cannot assure you that the new strategy will result in growth of practice-level sales of our kits and consumables from historical levels.       In connection with executing this plan, we are not renewing our existing contracts with our key U.S. distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014. In October 2014, three of our previously exclusive U.S. distribution partners announced that they would begin carrying competitive products in the fourth quarter of 2014, before we have completed our transition to an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. for our kits and consumables. We have historically sold significant amounts of our kits and consumables through our U.S. distribution partners, and the change in our existing relationships with these distribution partners and the transition of previously exclusive distributors to promoting and selling competitive products may adversely affect the retention of our customers for our kits and consumables and the sales and distribution of our products, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.              37          Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
