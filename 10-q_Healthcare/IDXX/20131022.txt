In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our estimates only as of the day this Quarterly Report was first filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements may also be included in other materials released to the public. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates or expectations change.           §    Business Overview and Trends       Operating segments. Prior to January 1, 2013, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries (“IDEXX,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”) operated primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the veterinary market, which we continue to refer to as the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”); water quality products (“Water”); and diagnostic products for livestock and poultry health, which we referred to as Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics. We also operated two smaller operating segments that comprise products for milk quality and safety (“Dairy”) and products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market (“OPTI Medical”). Financial information about our Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments was combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements in an “Other” category because they did not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments.        We have combined the management of our Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics, and Dairy lines of business to more effectively realize the market synergies between the product lines and to achieve operational efficiencies. We refer to this newly created segment as Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (“LPD”). Our OPTI Medical operating segment remains combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements in an “Other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. The segment income (loss) from operations discussed within this report for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 has been retrospectively revised to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments. See Note 16 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for financial information about our segments and the section entitled “Description of Business by Segment” under the heading “Item 1. Business” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 for additional description pertaining to our product and services.        CAG develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes products and performs services for veterinarians and the bioresearch market, primarily related to diagnostics and information management. Water develops, designs, manufactures and distributes a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological parameters in water. LPD develops, designs, manufactures and distributes diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to detect a wide range of diseases, to monitor health status in livestock and poultry and to detect contaminants in milk. OPTI Medical develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human medical diagnostics market. Further, OPTI Medical manufactures the dry slide electrolyte consumables that are a subset of the consumables used with our Catalyst Dx® analyzer and our VetStat® Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer and associated cassettes for our CAG segment.       19          Effects of Certain Factors on Results of Operations        Distributor Purchasing and Inventories. The instrument consumables and rapid assay products in our CAG segment are sold in the U.S. and certain other geographies by third party distributors, who purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices, which are the end users. As a result, distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products. Distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and in a given period may not be directly related to underlying end-user demand for our products. Consequently, reported results may reflect fluctuations in inventory levels held at distributors and not necessarily reflect changes in underlying end-user demand. Therefore, we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of end-user demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue.        Where growth rates are affected by changes in end-user demand, we refer to this as the impact of practice-level sales on growth. Where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics, we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories on growth. If during the current year, distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year, then changes in distributors’ inventories have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period. Conversely, if during the current year, distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year, then changes in distributors’ inventories have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period.        Consistent with our estimate as of September 30, 2012, we believe that our U.S. CAG distributors typically hold inventory equivalent to approximately four weeks of the anticipated end-user demand for instrument consumables and rapid assay products at the end of a quarter.       Currency Impact. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, approximately 25% and 26%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local currencies compared to 25% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012. Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally, and a weakening of the U.S. dollar has the opposite effect. Similarly, to the extent that the U.S. dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods, our growth rate will be negatively affected. The impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offset this exposure.        The impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), otherwise referred to herein as a non-U.S. GAAP measure. We calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the current year period.        During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same periods of the prior year, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately $2.2 million and $6.9 million, respectively, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.        Effects of Economic Conditions. Demand for many of our products and services has been negatively affected by economic conditions since mid-2008. In our CAG segment, we believe that low economic growth and relatively high unemployment have led to negative or cautious consumer sentiment, which has affected the number of patient visits to veterinary clinics. With regard to the U.S., based on data provided by a subset of our customers that use our practice management systems, we observed patient visits were flat to slightly down beginning in 2009. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011, we observed a slight improvement in the growth of patient visits, followed by further improvement during 2012 over the previous year periods. This improvement slowed during the first nine months of 2013. We believe that this data, though limited, provides a fair and meaningful representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the U.S. Economic conditions in certain European countries remain challenging, which we believe has a negative impact on our CAG segment in particular. We believe that the overall trend in patient visits since the beginning of the economic downturn has had a slightly negative impact on the growth rate of sales of rapid assay tests, VetLab® instrument consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services. In addition, we believe the rate of growth of sales of our VetLab instruments, digital radiography and practice management systems, which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians, has also been affected by continued caution among veterinarians regarding economic conditions. Weaker economic conditions since mid-2008 have also caused our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services resulting in lower revenue growth due to limited price increases for certain products.        20           We also believe that current economic conditions have affected purchasing decisions of our Water and LPD business customers. Lower water testing volumes have resulted from a decline in discretionary testing and a decline in mandated testing as a result of lower home and commercial construction. Fiscal difficulties in certain European countries have also reduced government funding for some water and livestock testing programs.        We believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets have partially mitigated the effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates. Looking forward, we are cautiously optimistic that the improvements we began to see in the U.S. commencing in the fourth quarter of 2011 and continuing in 2012 and 2013 are reflective of a gradual improvement in the macroeconomic environment that over time will further reduce these effects.         §    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates       The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant accounting policies used in preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 are consistent with those discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. The critical accounting policies and the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 are consistent with those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 in the section under the heading “Part 2, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”          §    Results of Operations       Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2012        Revenue        The following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth. Organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to, revenues reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control, are subject to volatility, and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends.        Organic revenue growth and the percentage changes in revenue from currency and acquisitions are non-U.S. GAAP measures. See the subsection above titled “Effects of Certain Factors on Results of Operations” for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period.       21          Total Company. The following table presents revenue by operating segment:                                                                                                      Net Revenue   (dollars in thousands)        For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2013        For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2012        Dollar  Change        Percentage  Change        Percentage  Change from  Currency         Percentage  Change from  Acquisitions         OrganicRevenue Growth                                                                                                 CAG         $  283,843 				       $  262,357 				       $  21,486 				     8.2 				   %      (0.9 				   %)      0.4 				   %      8.7 				   %      Water          23,247 				         22,223 				         1,024 				     4.6 				   %      (0.7 				   %)        -          5.3 				   %      LPD          25,131 				         24,696 				         435 				     1.8 				   %      1.1 				   %      2.8 				   %      (2.1 				   %)      Other          6,076 				         6,199 				         (123 				   )  (2.0 				   %)      0.3 				   %        -          (2.3 				   %)       Total Company        $  338,297 				       $  315,475 				       $  22,822 				     7.2 				   %      (0.7 				   %)      0.5 				   %      7.4 				   %                                                                                                 Companion Animal Group.

VetLab consumables revenue growth was due to higher unit volumes and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. The increase in unit volumes resulted primarily from growth of our installed base for our Catalyst Dx® and ProCyte Dx® instruments as a result of customer acquisitions, as well as an increase in testing from existing customers who upgraded to these instruments, partially offset by lower sales of consumables used with our VetTest® chemistry instrument. Higher realized prices were due primarily to changes in certain distributor arrangements. The impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported consumables revenue growth by approximately 5%.        VetLab service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments.        The increase in rapid assay product revenue was due primarily to an increase in sales volumes, most notably higher canine practice-level sales volumes, and higher average unit sales prices resulting from price increases. The impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels contributed approximately 1% to reported revenue growth. A portion of the higher canine practice-level sales volumes was due to the impact of changes to customer loyalty programs, which resulted in a shift of sales volumes from the first quarter to the second and third quarters.         The increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted primarily from the impact of higher testing volumes and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Higher testing volumes were driven by the acquisition of new customers, increased testing volumes from existing customers and improved customer retention.           22        The increase in customer information management and digital imaging systems revenue resulted primarily from higher support revenue due to an increase in our active installed base and revenue from Pet Health Network® Pro, which launched commercially in the first quarter of 2013.        Water. The increase in Water revenue resulted from higher sales of our Colilert® products and increased sales volumes of our Filta-Max® products. Higher sales of our Colilert products were the result of higher sales volumes in North America, a geography where these products are sold at higher average unit sales prices.        Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. The decrease in LPD revenue resulted primarily from lower sales volumes of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (“BSE”) tests resulting from changes in European Union testing requirements, partly offset by higher sales volumes of certain swine tests.        Other. The decrease in Other revenue was attributable primarily to lower sales volumes associated with our pharmaceutical product line, partly offset by higher sales volumes of consumables used with our OPTI Medical instruments and royalty revenue from our pharmaceutical out-licensing arrangements.

Gross profit for CAG increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 54% from 53%. The increase in gross profit percentage resulted from higher average unit sales prices due primarily to price increases for our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and a combination of higher relative sales of VetLab consumables that yield higher margins and lower relative sales of low margin VetLab instruments.         Water. Gross profit for Water increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 67% from 65%. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower relative sales of low margin products, higher relative sales of our Colilert products in North America where these products are sold at higher average unit sales prices and lower overall manufacturing costs driven by a decrease in materials cost.       Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. Gross profit for LPD decreased due to a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 52% from 59%, partly offset by higher sales. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was due to higher overall manufacturing costs, due primarily to lower production volumes in certain product lines and an increase in materials costs.        Other. Gross profit for Other increased due to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 49% from 42%, partly offset by lower sales. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due to higher relative royalty revenue from our remaining pharmaceutical out-licensing arrangements and sales of consumables used with our OPTI Medical instruments, both of which yield higher margins, as well as a decrease in OPTI Medical manufacturing costs resulting from a reduction in materials costs.            23          Unallocated Amounts. Gross profit for Unallocated Amounts increased due to changes in certain currency exchange rates and a decrease in certain manufacturing costs. In certain geographies where we maintain inventories in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the product costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold stated at the budgeted currency exchange rate from the beginning of the fiscal year, which is used to establish our standard costs for products sold. In these geographies, the variances from standard cost for products sold related to changes in currency exchange rates are reported within the caption “Unallocated Amounts”. For the three months ended September 30, 2013, these variances were due primarily to the cost of product sold in Japan. Additionally, the manufacturing costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and certain variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period. We capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We then record these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold.

The increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from transaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of the Brazilian distributor and higher personnel related costs. The decrease in research and development expense resulted primarily from lower consulting costs and a decrease in personnel-related costs.        Other. Operating expenses for Other decreased $0.7 million to $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to lower personnel-related costs.       Unallocated Amounts. Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments decreased $0.5 million to $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to a decrease in certain personnel-related costs. We estimate certain personnel-related costs and allocate the estimated expenses to the operating segments. This allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” The decrease in certain personnel-related costs for Unallocated Amounts is due primarily to lower self-insured health care costs during the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period of the prior year.       Interest Income and Interest Expense        Interest income was $0.5 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012.        Interest expense increased $0.6 million to $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 due primarily to higher average balances outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facility. In May 2013, we refinanced our existing $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $450 million as more fully described under the heading “Item 1. Financial Statements; Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 10” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.            25          Provision for Income Taxes        Our effective income tax rate was 29.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to 31.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2012. On January 2, 2013, U.S. federal legislation was enacted that retroactively allowed a research and development (“R&D”) tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the R&D tax credit through the twelve months ending December 31, 2013. For the three months ended September 30, 2012, the U.S. legislation authorizing the R&D tax credit had expired and no associated tax benefit was recognized within this period. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same period of the prior year was due primarily to tax benefits realized in the 2013 period resulting from the R&D tax credit and the resolution of an international audit, which resulted in a reduction in our provision for uncertain tax positions.        Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2012        Revenue        The following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth. Organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to, revenues reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control, are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends.        Organic revenue growth and the percentage changes in revenue from currency and acquisitions are non-U.S. GAAP measures. See the subsection above titled “Effects of Certain Factors on Results of Operations - Currency Impact” for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period.

Lower instrument revenue was also due to the impact of customer programs, including a reagent rental program that was launched in the fourth quarter of 2012, where instrument revenue is recognized over the term of the rental agreement instead of at the time we place the instrument.       VetLab consumables revenue growth was due to both higher unit volumes and higher realized prices. The increase in unit volumes resulted primarily from growth of our installed base for our Catalyst Dx and ProCyte Dx instruments as a result of customer acquisitions, as well as an increase in testing from existing customers who upgraded to these instruments, partially offset by lower sales of consumables used with our VetTest chemistry instrument. Higher realized prices include the impact of list price increases, as well as higher prices charged as a result of changes in certain distributor arrangements. The impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported consumables revenue growth by approximately 2%.        VetLab service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments.       The increase in rapid assay product revenue was due primarily to an increase in canine practice-level sales volumes and higher average unit sales prices resulting from price increases. The impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels did not have a significant impact on revenue growth.        The increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted from the impact of both increased testing volumes and price increases. Higher testing volumes were driven by the acquisition of new customers and  increased testing volumes from existing customers.       The decrease in customer information management and digital imaging systems revenue resulted primarily from a decrease in digital radiography system placements and, to a lesser extent, Cornerstone® system placements. These unfavorable factors were partly offset by higher support revenue due to an increase in our active installed base and revenue from Pet Health Network® Pro, which launched commercially in the first quarter of 2013.       Water. The increase in Water revenue resulted primarily from higher Colilert product and related accessories sales volumes in North America, Latin America and Europe.        Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. The decrease in LPD revenue resulted primarily from lower sales volumes of BSE tests resulting from changes in European Union testing requirements and lower sales volumes of our Dairy SNAP® tests used for the detection of the contaminant Aflatoxin M1 and antibiotic residues in milk. In early 2012, Dairy SNAP® sales volumes were favorably impacted by testing as a result of an Aflatoxin M1 outbreak in China. Testing volumes in China subsided over the remainder of 2012. These unfavorable factors were partly offset by increased sales volume of certain swine tests.           27       Other. The decrease in Other revenue was attributable primarily to lower sales volumes associated with our pharmaceutical product line, partly offset by higher sales volumes of consumables used with our OPTI Medical instruments and milestone and royalty revenue from our pharmaceutical out-licensing arrangements.

Gross profit for CAG increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 54% from 53%. The increase in gross profit percentage was due primarily to price increases for both our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and VetLab consumables, efficiencies realized throughout our reference laboratory operations and a combination of lower relative sales of low margin VetLab instruments and higher relative sales of VetLab consumables that yield higher margins.         Water. Gross profit for Water increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 67% from 66%. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher relative sales of our Colilert products in geographies where these products are sold at higher average unit sales prices.        Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. Gross profit for LPD decreased due to a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 54% from 60% and lower sales. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher overall manufacturing costs, due primarily to lower production volumes in certain product lines and an increase in materials costs, and the unfavorable impact of currency. The unfavorable impact of currency was due primarily to hedging losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to hedging gains during the same period of the prior year.        Other. Gross profit for Other increased due to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 50% from 43%, partly offset by lower sales. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due to a decrease in OPTI Medical manufacturing costs resulting from a reduction in materials cost and higher relative milestone and royalty revenue from our remaining pharmaceutical out-licensing arrangements, which yield higher margins.        Unallocated Amounts. Gross profit for Unallocated Amounts increased due to changes in certain currency exchange rates. In certain geographies where we maintain inventories in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the product costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold stated at the budgeted currency exchange rate from the beginning of the fiscal year, which is used to establish our standard cost for products sold. In these geographies, the variances from standard cost for products sold related to changes in currency exchange rates are reported within the caption “Unallocated Amounts”. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, these variances were due primarily to the cost of product sold in Japan.        28              Operating Expenses and Operating Income        Total Company.

The increases in general and administrative expense associated with the acquisition of a Brazilian distributor, including transaction and integration expenses, were largely offset by lower personnel-related costs and a decrease in intangible asset amortization. Research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was generally consistent with the same period of the prior year.       Other. Operating expenses for Other decreased $1.1 million to $7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to a decrease in personnel-related costs.       Unallocated Amounts. Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased $1.1 million to $7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to losses incurred resulting from the bankruptcy of a freight payment and audit service provider (“freight service company”), partly offset by lower legal and other professional fees incurred as result of the resolution of the FTC investigation in February 2013 and proceeds received during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 in connection with the demutualization of an insurance provider. On March 25, 2013, the freight service company provided notice to us that all freight payment services would cease immediately and that certain amounts paid by us to the freight service company were not subsequently remitted to our freight carriers due to an employee fraud and a breakdown in internal controls, both at the freight service company, concluding in significant losses and the resulting bankruptcy. In response, we recorded a $3.9 million loss related to these unremitted amounts in general and administrative expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2013. We continue to monitor the freight service company’s bankruptcy proceeding, but we cannot be certain of any recovery at this time.        The increase in operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments was further offset by lower personnel-related costs related to unallocated corporate support function expenses. With respect to personnel-related costs, we estimate certain personnel-related costs and allocate the estimated expenses to the operating segments. This allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.”       Interest Income and Interest Expense        Interest income was $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $1.4 million for the same period of the prior year.        Interest expense increased $0.5 million to $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 due primarily to higher average balances outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facility. In May 2013, we refinanced our existing $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $450 million as more fully described under the heading “Item 1. Financial Statements; Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 10” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.         Provision for Income Taxes         Our effective income tax rate was 28.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to 31.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. On January 2, 2013, U.S. federal legislation was enacted that retroactively allowed a R&D tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the R&D tax credit through the twelve months ending December 31, 2013. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, the U.S. legislation authorizing the R&D tax credit had expired and no associated tax benefit was recognized within this period. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same period of the prior year was due primarily to the R&D tax credit. Because the related legislation was enacted in 2013, the full benefit of the R&D tax credit related to the prior year’s activities was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2013.        30             §    Recent Accounting Pronouncements       A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.          §    Liquidity and Capital Resources       Liquidity        We fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, and amounts available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, we had $264.8 million and $224.0 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, and working capital of $32.3 million and $163.2 million, respectively. Additionally, at September 30, 2013, we had remaining borrowing availability of $51.8 million under our $450 million unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe that, if necessary, we could obtain additional borrowings at prevailing market interest rates to fund our growth objectives. We further believe that current cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operations, and available borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital purchase requirements, and strategic growth needs for the next twelve months, and that these resources will be sufficient in the long term to fund our business as currently conducted.        We consider the majority of the operating earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. No provision has been made for the payment of U.S. federal and state, or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Changes to this position could have adverse tax consequences. A determination of related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually repatriated is not practicable.   We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries. Our foreign cash balances are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the U.S. Of our total cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2013, approximately $263.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily securing various obligations) was approximately $1.4 million. As of September 30, 2013, 30% of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was invested in money market funds restricted to U.S. government and agency securities, 45% was held as bank deposits, and 25% was invested in money market funds having investments in highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. As of September 30, 2013, approximately 57% of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was held in U.S. dollars.        Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or other dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates.        The following table presents additional key information concerning working capital:                    For the Three Months Ended               September 30, 2013        June 30, 2013        March 31, 2013        December 31, 2012        September 30, 2012                                                                         Days sales outstanding(1)          41.9 				         41.2 				         40.8 				         39.9 				         41.7 				     Inventory turns(2)          1.7 				         1.7 				         1.7 				         1.8 				         1.7 				                                                                        (1) Days sales outstanding represents the average of the accounts receivable balances at the beginning and end of each quarter divided by revenue for that quarter, the result of which is then multiplied by 91.25 days.

Cash provided by operating activities was $179.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to $153.5 million for the same period of the prior year. The total of net income and net non-cash charges, excluding the impact of reclassifying the tax benefit from share based compensation arrangements to a financing activity, was $198.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $184.4 million for the same period in 2012, resulting in incremental operating cash flows of $14.2 million driven primarily by the increase in net income. The total of changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements decreased cash by $18.9 million and $31.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, resulting in an incremental increase in cash of $12.0 million.        The following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements:                                                                                                          For the Nine Months Ended September 30,                      (dollars in thousands)      2013 				      2012 				       Dollar Change                                                            Accounts receivable         $  (12,795 				   )     $  255 				       $  (13,050 				   )       Inventories          (6,360 				   )      (18,078 				   )      11,718 				         Other assets            4,717 				           539 				           4,178 				         Accounts payable          2,184 				         (4,893 				   )      7,077 				         Accrued liabilities            (3,269 				   )       (3,751 				   )        482 				         Deferred revenue          4,050 				         5,151 				         (1,101 				   )      Tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements            (7,438 				   )       (10,182 				   )       2,744 				          Total change in cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements        $  (18,911 				   )    $  (30,959 				   )    $  12,048 				                The increase in cash used for purchasing inventories during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was less than the same period of the prior year due primarily to the timing of inventory receipts during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. Incremental cash provided by accounts payable during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was due primarily to the timing of vendor payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same period of the prior year. The incremental cash provided by other assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was due primarily to a $6.3 million royalty prepayment to a licensor during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. The increase in accounts receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was greater than the increase during the same period of the prior year due primarily to higher revenues in the last month of the quarter ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same period of the prior year and the timing of customer payments.        We historically have experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by the payment of annual bonuses in connection with employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vector-borne disease testing, which has historically resulted in significant increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year.           32          Investing Activities. Cash used by investing activities was $68.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to $41.1 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase in cash used by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same period of the prior year was due primarily to incremental purchases of property and equipment and the acquisition of a Brazilian distributor. The incremental purchases of property and equipment were primarily related to investments to expand our headquarters facility in Westbrook, Maine and, to a lesser extent, our investments in manufacturing equipment. Our acquisition of the Brazilian distributor is described in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on 10-Q.       Our total capital expenditure plan for 2013 is estimated to be approximately $90 million, which includes the expansion of our headquarters facility in Westbrook, Maine, investments in software for internal use and information technology infrastructure, capital investments in manufacturing equipment and investments in our reference laboratory equipment and facilities.       Financing Activities. Cash used by financing activities was $69.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to $75.5 million for the same period in 2012. The incremental cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to an increase in net borrowings under the Credit Facility, partly offset by an increase in cash used to repurchase common stock.        Cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock increased by $191.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same period of the prior year. From the inception of our share repurchase program in August 1999 to September 30, 2013, we have repurchased 48.2 million shares. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we purchased 3.1 million shares for an aggregate cost of $282.9 million compared to purchases of 1.0 million shares for an aggregate cost of $91.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. We believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price. See Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information about our share repurchases.        In May 2013, we refinanced our existing $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $450 million with a syndicate of multinational banks, which matures on May 8, 2018 (the new credit facility and the previous credit facility are referred to collectively as the “Credit Facility”) and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date. Though the Credit Facility does not mature until May 8, 2018, all amounts borrowed under the terms of the Credit Facility are reflected in the current liabilities section in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets because the Credit Facility contains a subjective material adverse event clause, which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the Credit Facility if we fail to notify the syndicate of such an event. Applicable interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facility generally range from 0.875 to 1.25 percentage points (“Credit Spread”) above the London interbank offered rate or the Canadian Dollar-denominated bankers’ acceptance rate, dependent on our leverage ratio, or the prevailing prime rate plus a maximum spread of up to 0.25%, dependent on our leverage ratio.       Net borrowing and repayment activity under our Credit Facility resulted in incremental cash provided of $196.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same period of the prior year. At September 30, 2013, we had $397.2 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The general availability of funds under the Credit Facility was further reduced by $1.0 million for a letter of credit issued related to our worker’s compensation policy covering claims for the years ending 2009 through 2013. The obligations under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, which includes customary events of default including, without limitation, payment defaults, defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the failure to pay specified indebtedness, and a change of control default. The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates and certain restrictive agreements. The financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization not to exceed 3-to-1. At September 30, 2013, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility.            33              Other Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees        Significant commitments, contingencies and guarantees at September 30, 2013 are consistent with those discussed in the section under the heading “Part 2, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.        Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk        For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting IDEXX, see the section under the heading “Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. As of the date of this report, there have been no material changes to the market risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.        Item 4. Controls and Procedures        Disclosure Controls and Procedures        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in its Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures at September 30, 2013, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.        Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting        There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2013 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.        PART II — OTHER INFORMATION        Item 1. Legal Proceedings       In January 2010, we received a letter from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), stating that it was conducting an investigation to determine whether IDEXX or others had engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”), through pricing or marketing policies for companion animal veterinary products and services, including but not limited to exclusive dealing or tying arrangements with distributors or end-users of those products or services (the “Investigation”).        On December 5, 2012, we entered into an Agreement Containing Consent Order to Cease and Desist (“Consent Agreement”) with the FTC staff to resolve the Investigation. The Consent Agreement, which is ten years in duration, specifies that IDEXX may have exclusive distribution agreements with two of the following three distributors: MWI Veterinary Supply, Inc. (“MWI”), Butler Schein Animal Health, and Webster Veterinary. The FTC Commissioners granted final approval of the Consent Agreement on February 11, 2013 resulting in the final resolution of the Investigation.            34       We continue to believe that our marketing and sales practices for companion animal veterinary products and services do not violate applicable antitrust laws. We have chosen to enter into the Consent Agreement because we believe this course will help us avoid long and costly litigation and that our business will not be materially adversely affected.        From time to time, we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.        Item 1A. Risk Factors        Our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below, which have been updated to reflect developments subsequent to the discussion of those factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, as well as those factors discussed elsewhere in this report.       Our Failure to Successfully Execute Certain Strategies Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Growth and Profitability        The companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants. Our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy, which include:          ·    Developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative new or improved and cost competitive in-clinic laboratory analyzers that drive sales of IDEXX VetLab® instruments, grow our installed base of instruments, and increase demand for related consumable products, services and accessories;        ·    Developing and introducing new proprietary diagnostic tests and services that provide valuable medical information to our customers and effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;        ·    Increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of these products and the management of diagnostic information derived from our products;        ·    Providing our veterinary customers with the medical and business tools, information and resources that enable them to grow their practices through increased pet visits and enhanced practice of real-time care;        ·    Achieving cost improvements in our worldwide network of laboratories by implementing global best practices including lean processing techniques, incorporating technological enhancements including laboratory automation and a global laboratory information management system, employing purchasing strategies to maximize leverage of our global scale, increasing the leverage of existing infrastructure and consolidating testing in high volume laboratory hubs;        ·    Achieving cost improvements in the manufacture and service of our in-clinic laboratory analyzers by employing the benefits of economies of scale in both negotiating supply contracts and leveraging manufacturing overhead, and by improving reliability of our instruments;          35            ·    Achieving productivity improvements in our companion animal diagnostic sales organization in North America by transitioning our specialty sales force that represent either in-house or reference laboratory diagnostics to account representatives who represent the full line of IDEXX diagnostics. We believe we have mitigated our risk of sales force turnover and productivity losses during this transition by adding headcount to our sales force while reducing the size of the geographic territories, providing extensive individualized training and empowering our sales representatives with intuitive sales technologies. We further believe this transition better aligns our sales force with the needs of the veterinary practices resulting in deeper relationships with our customers, improved sales force retention and alignment with our overall diagnostic strategy;        ·    Attracting, developing and retaining key leadership and talent necessary to support all elements of our strategy;         ·    Expanding our served market and growing our market share by strengthening our sales and marketing activities both within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the U.S.;         ·    Identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business or geographic areas for us; and        ·    Developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies.       If we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies, our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted.        Our Dependence on a Limited Number of Suppliers Could Limit Our Ability to Sell Certain Products or Reduce Our Profitability        We currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products include our Catalyst Dx® consumables; ProCyte Dx® hematology, IDEXX VetAutoread™ hematology, VetLyte® electrolyte, IDEXX VetLab® UA™ urinalysis, VetTest® chemistry, and Coag Dx™ blood coagulation analyzers and related consumables and accessories; image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems; and certain components and raw materials used in our SNAP® rapid assay devices, livestock and poultry diagnostic tests, dairy testing products and LaserCyte® and LaserCyte® Dx hematology analyzers. To mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers, we seek when possible to enter into long-term contracts that ensure an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices. However, some suppliers decline to enter into long-term contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis. There can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products, that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts, or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products. In cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders, we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply. In addition, under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers, we may be unable to supply the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.        36          Our Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture, Which Could Negatively Affect Our Ability to Supply the Market        Many of our rapid assay, livestock and poultry diagnostic, water and dairy products are biologic products, which are products that include materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products, with samples and with the environment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria. Further, products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory, which could necessitate field actions that would require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products, and could damage customer relations. Our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.       A Weak Economy Could Result in Reduced Demand for Our Products and Services or Increased Customer Credit Risk        A substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market. Demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits with their respective owners to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing, as well as the pet owner compliance with these recommendations. Economic weakness in our significant markets in recent years has caused and could continue to cause pet owners to skip or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or could affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests, comply with a treatment plan or, even more fundamentally, continue to own a pet. In addition, concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems. A decline in patient visits to the hospital, in the willingness of pet owners to treat certain health conditions or approve certain tests, in pet ownership in general, or in the inclination of veterinarians to recommend certain tests or make capital purchases could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.        Demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at the government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products. Availability of funds also affects demand by the government laboratories and cattle, swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products, and by users of our human point-of-care diagnostic instruments. Economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.        In all of our markets, a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers, which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all.        Strengthening of the Rate of Exchange for the U.S. Dollar Has a Negative Effect on Our Business        Any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against non-U.S. currencies, and in particular the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Australian dollar, adversely affects our results, as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars and exported to international markets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, approximately 25% and 26%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local currencies compared to 25% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012.  To mitigate such foreign currency exposure, we utilize non-speculative forward currency exchange contracts. A strengthening U.S. dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the U.S. to pay for purchases denominated in U.S. dollars.        37          Various Government Regulations Could Limit or Delay Our Ability to Market and Sell Our Products        In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Our infectious disease diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including most rapid assay canine and feline SNAP® tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale in the U.S. Our dairy testing products require approval by the FDA prior to sale in the U.S. Our water testing products must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the U.S. as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA. The manufacture and sale of our OPTI® line of human point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by the FDA and these products require approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially in the U.S. The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries. Any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the U.S. or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture or sell our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.       The Impact of One of Our Distributors Becoming Non-exclusive on Our Results of Operations is Uncertain        On February 11, 2013, the FTC granted final approval of the Agreement Containing Consent Order to Cease and Desist previously reached with the FTC staff to resolve the investigation into whether IDEXX had engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Details about the FTC investigation and the resulting agreement are described above in “Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings.”       On September 28, 2012, we entered into a modified agreement with MWI Veterinary Supply, Inc. (“MWI”) that became effective January 1, 2013. Under this modified agreement, MWI is permitted to carry any competitive products without restriction or potential negative consequence. This agreement satisfies the requirements of the Consent Agreement, that we may have exclusive distribution agreements with only two of the three largest U.S. distributors of companion animal veterinary products. The modification of our agreement with MWI has resulted in several of our competitors selling products through MWI, which we expect will add field sales resources of MWI to those of our competitors to sell their products. Under the modified agreement with MWI, we will provide lower compensation to MWI on sales of our products since we will no longer receive the benefits of MWI’s exclusive focus on our products. We have reinvested savings from this lower rate of compensation in other direct sales and marketing resources. We believe that the reallocation of these sales resources will help mitigate the potential effects of the loss of exclusive focus of MWI and the additional field sales resources used by our competitors. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to fully mitigate the competitive effects of the changes in the nature of our agreement with MWI. Any reduction in the relative effectiveness of our overall selling efforts could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, which we do not believe would be material.        Our Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Our Proprietary Technologies        We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us.        We cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights.        In the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.        38          Distributor Purchasing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results        We sell many of our products, including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the U.S., through distributors. Distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the end-user demand for our products. In addition, our agreements with U.S. distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days prior written notice. Because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors, the unanticipated loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency, timing or size of distributor purchases, could have a negative effect on our results of operations.        Distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies. Consolidation within distribution channels increases our customer concentration level, which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph.        Increased Competition and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results        We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense. Competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways. New competitors may enter our markets and new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services, which could be superior to our products and services. Some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering similar products and services to ours at lower sales prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive. In addition, multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through co-marketing or other arrangements, which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering. Some of our competitors and potential competitors, including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies, have substantially greater financial resources than us, and greater experience in manufacturing, marketing, research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do.        Changes in Testing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results        The market for our companion animal, livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices. The introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing. Changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect. Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence. In addition, changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing, such as our livestock and poultry, dairy and water products. Declines in testing for any of the reasons described, along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.        Effective January 1, 2009, the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE” or “mad cow disease”) in the European Union was increased from 30 months to 48 months, which reduced the population of cattle tested by approximately 30%. In February 2011, the European Union’s Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (“SCFCAH”) agreed to allow its member states to further raise the recommended testing age to 72 months, effective July 1, 2011, which further reduced the population of cattle tested. In December 2012, the SCFCAH agreed to allow European Union member states the option to eliminate BSE testing of healthy cattle at slaughter effective March 2013. The demand for our BSE testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of these regulatory changes and could be further impacted by further changes that could be made in the future. Revenue from BSE testing products was less than $10 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012.       39          Increase in Corporate Hospital Ownership and Prevalence of Buying Consortiums Could Negatively Affect Our Business        An increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. is owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners in the U.S. include Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Antech, Inc., and National Veterinary Associates, each of which is currently a customer of IDEXX. A similar trend exists in the U.K. and the Nordic countries and may in the future also develop in other countries. Furthermore, an increasing percentage of individually owned veterinary hospitals in the U.S. are participating in buying consortiums. Corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. While we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums that we believe are positive for our business, decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums, in particular Banfield Pet Hospital, to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations, which could be material. In addition, certain corporate owners, most notably VCA Antech, Inc., our primary competitor in the U.S. and Canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services, also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals. Any hospitals acquired by these companies generally use their reference laboratory services almost exclusively and shift a large portion of their testing from in-clinic testing to their reference laboratories. Furthermore, because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace, hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services, which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline.        Our Limited Experience and Small Scale in the Human Point-of-Care Market Could Inhibit Our Success in this Market        We have limited experience in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market. This market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market. Significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more extensive regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation. Our limited experience and small scale in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market.        Risks Associated with Doing Business Internationally Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results       For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, approximately 41% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S., which was unchanged from the same periods of the prior year. Various possible risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales, including disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, import/export duties and licensing requirements, natural disasters and unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets. Further, prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors. Our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results of operations for that period.        Our Operations are Vulnerable to Interruption as a Result of Natural and Man-Made Disasters or System Failures        The operation of all of our facilities may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and man-made disasters, interruptions in power supply or other system failures. While we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events.            40          We manufacture many of our significant companion animal products, including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments, many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock, poultry and dairy testing products, at a single facility in Westbrook, Maine. Certain of our companion animal products, as well as our human point-of-care products, are manufactured in Roswell, Georgia. We also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in Bern, Switzerland and Montpellier, France. In addition, we maintain major distribution facilities in North America and in the Netherlands and major reference laboratories in Memphis, Tennessee; Leipzig, Germany; Ludwigsburg, Germany; Sacramento, California; Elmhurst, Illinois; North Grafton, Massachusetts; East Brisbane, Australia; Markham, Ontario; and Wetherby, the United Kingdom. Therefore, interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations given our customers expect rapid turnaround times.        We rely on several information systems throughout our company to keep financial records, process customer orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. If we were to experience a system disruption that impacts any of our critical functions, it could result in the loss of sales and customers, financial misstatement and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business.        We maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature. However, this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur. In addition, such insurance will not compensate us for the long-term competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations.        We Could Be Subject to Class Action Litigation Due to Stock Price Volatility, which, if it Occurs, Could Result in Substantial Costs or Large Judgments Against Us        The market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. Securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.        If Our Quarterly or Annual Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our Stock Price to Decline, Resulting in Losses to You        Our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing of distributor purchases, product launches, operating expenditures, marketing programs, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and litigation and claim-related expenditures; changes in competitors’ product offerings; changes in the economy affecting consumer spending; and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall.        Future Operating Results Could Be Negatively Affected by the Resolution of Various Uncertain Tax Positions and by Potential Changes to Tax Incentives        In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination was made. Our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions. If we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives, or if they expire or are renewed at less favorable terms, our inability to realize these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings.        41          Restrictions in Our Credit Facility or Our Inability to Obtain Financing on Favorable Terms May Limit Our Activities       Our ability to satisfy our obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative, negative and financial covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the Credit Facility could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under the Credit Facility, which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt and possibly on terms not deemed favorable.        We fund our operations, capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand, funds generated from operations and amounts available under our Credit Facility. If we were unable to obtain financing on favorable terms, we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability.        Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
