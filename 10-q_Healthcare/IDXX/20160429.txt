Item 1A. Risk Factors.” included in our 2015 Annual Report for additional information regarding tax impacts.    ﻿       21          Our foreign currency exchange impacts are comprised of three components: 1) revenues and expenses denominated in a foreign currency; 2) the impact of hedge contracts; and 3) intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary. Based on projected revenues and expenses for 2016, excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies, we estimate a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would reduce operating income for the remainder of 2016 by approximately $11 million. This level is higher than in previous years due to the addition of estimated unhedged foreign currency exposures, including emerging market currencies that have higher relative revenue growth and volatility. The impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded, as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have on our operating income.       The impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), otherwise referred to herein as a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable prior year period applied to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results normalized for changes in currency in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods.    ﻿   During the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately $7.6 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and British pound. Additionally, these changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced total company operating profit by $6.2 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.05 during the three months ended March 31, 2016. This unfavorable impact was net of offsetting foreign currency hedging gains, which increased total company operating profit by $0.8 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.01 during the three months ended March 31, 2016.   ﻿   At our current currency exchange rate assumptions as compared to actual 2015 exchange rates, we anticipate that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to major foreign currencies in which we transact will decrease total company revenue by approximately $13.4 million in the year ending December 31, 2016. Additionally, these changes in foreign currency exchange rates are expected to reduce total company operating profit by $24.5 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.21. This unfavorable impact is net of offsetting foreign currency hedging gains, which are expected to increase total company operating profit by $2.4 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.02 in the year ending December 31, 2016. The above estimate incorporates actual exchange rates for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and assumes that the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at $1.12, the British pound at $1.40, the Canadian dollar at $0.75, the Australian dollar at $0.75 and the Japanese yen at ¥113 to the U.S. dollar for the remainder of 2016.       Effects of Economic Conditions. Demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment, including slow economic growth, high unemployment and credit availability. Negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending, resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics. Unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments and diagnostic imaging systems, which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians. Additionally, economic turmoil can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services. In the U.S., we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our CAG customers. Although this data is a limited sample and susceptible to short-term impacts such as weather, which may affect the number of patient visits in a given period, we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful long-term representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the U.S., providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services.   ﻿   Economic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our Water and LPD business customers. Water testing volumes may be susceptible to declines in discretionary testing for existing home and commercial sales and in mandated testing as a result of decreases in home and commercial construction. Testing volumes may also be impacted by severe weather conditions such as drought. In addition, fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and livestock testing programs.        We believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets partially mitigate the potential effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates.    ﻿       22          Effects of Patent Expiration. Although the Company has several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2015 and are expected to expire during 2016 and 2017, the expiration of these patents or licenses, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or future operations due to a range of factors including our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace; the breadth, quality and integration of our product offerings; our existing customer relationships and our customer support; our sales force; the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products; our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies and/or additional patents; and our significant know-how, scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings. See “Part I. Item 1. Business - Patents and Licenses” of our 2015 Annual Report for more information.   ﻿     §    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates       The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The critical accounting policies and the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2016 are consistent with those discussed in our 2015 Annual Report in the section under the heading “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”          §    Results of Operations       The following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth, and references in this analysis and discussion to “revenue,” “revenues” or “revenue growth” are references to “organic revenue growth.” Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period for the prior year, net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures. Organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to, revenues reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers. We exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control, are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature, size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period, require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction, and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends.   ﻿   Organic revenue growth and the percentage changes in revenue from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions are non-GAAP financial measures. See the subsection above titled “Effects of Certain Factors on Results of Operations – Currency Impact” for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period.

These favorable impacts were partly offset by lower consumables volumes from our VetTest ® chemistry instrument due to customer upgrades from our previous generation VetTest to our Catalyst analyzers. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenue also benefited from higher average unit sales prices.    ﻿   IDEXX VetLab service and accessories revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2016 were generally consistent with the same period of the prior year.   ﻿   Rapid assay revenue was generally consistent with the same period of the prior year as the unfavorable impact of lower average unit sales prices in the U.S. for certain earlier generation rapid assay products was offset by higher sales volumes of canine and feline specialty single analyte SNAP® products.       The increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was due primarily to the impact of higher testing volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories, most prominently in the U.S., resulting from increased testing from existing customers and the net acquisition of new customers. Additionally, the increase in revenue was the result of higher average unit sales prices due to price increases. Testing volumes benefitted slightly from favorable weather trends as compared to the same period of the prior year and an extra business day in the first quarter of 2016 due to a leap year.    ﻿       24       CAG Diagnostic capital instrument placements drive highly profitable recurring diagnostics revenue. The launch of Catalyst One ® analyzer internationally continues to drive strong worldwide chemistry placements. Our hematology placements continue to be driven by Procyte Dx in the U.S. and Europe. The increase in CAG Diagnostics capital instruments revenue was driven by an increase in ProCyte Dx revenues and to a lesser extent, Catalyst One revenues.    ﻿   The increase in customer information management and diagnostic imaging systems revenue was due primarily to an increase in diagnostic imaging system placements, higher service revenue resulting from an increase in our active installed base of diagnostic imaging and practice management systems, increased revenues from other customer information management services and higher revenues from an increasing IDEXX Pet Health Network® Pro subscriber base. These favorable factors were partly offset by the impact of fewer licensed-based Cornerstone placements as we evolve to a subscription-based model for new practice management customer acquisitions.    ﻿   Water. The increase in Water revenue was attributable to all regions in which we operate, most notably from strong performance in North America. Higher revenues resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of our Colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and E. coli testing, placements of our Quanti-Tray Sealer PLUS instrument, which we launched in June 2015, and higher sales volumes of our products designed to detect cryptosporidium. Testing volumes benefitted slightly from favorable weather trends as compared to the same period of the prior year and an extra business day in the first quarter of 2016 due to a leap year. Additionally, we also benefitted from price increases enacted in 2016.        Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. The increase in LPD organic revenue resulted from strong performance in emerging markets, most notably resulting from higher sales volumes of swine testing products and new products including bovine pregnancy tests in China and higher dairy volumes in Latin America, and increased livestock testing services in the Asia-Pacific region. These favorable factors were partly offset by decreased sales volumes of bovine testing products within Western Europe in large part due to the success of certain disease eradication programs.       Other. The increase in Other revenue was due primarily to higher sales of our OPTI Medical blood gas analyzers and related consumables in the Asia-Pacific region.

The decrease in gross profit percentage was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of currency, an increase in IDEXX VetLab and LPD products costs, and unfavorable CAG product mix, resulting from higher relative instrument revenue and lower relative revenue from our rapid assay test kits. The negative effect of currency resulted from lower relative hedging gains during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year, and the unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These unfavorable factors were partly offset by higher average unit sales prices for our reference laboratory diagnostic services and IDEXX VetLab consumables.   ﻿   Companion Animal Group. Gross profit for CAG increased due to higher sales, partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage from 55% to 53%. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was due to the unfavorable impact of currency, an unfavorable product mix resulting primarily from higher relative instrument revenue and lower relative revenue from our rapid assay test kits and an increase in IDEXX VetLab product costs. The unfavorable impact of currency during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year, resulted from lower relative hedging gains and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Gross profit for Water increased due to higher sales, partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage from 70% to 68%. The decrease in the gross profit percentage resulted from the unfavorable impact of currency during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year, due to lower relative hedging gains and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Gross profit for LPD decreased due a decrease in the gross profit percentage from 64% to 58% and lower sales. The decrease in the gross profit percentage resulted primarily from the unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, higher overall product costs due to the recognition during the prior year period of previously capitalized favorable manufacturing variances, and lower average unit sales prices on our dairy products. The negative effect of currency resulted from hedging losses realized during the period ending March 31, 2016, as compared to hedging gains during the same period of the prior year and the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These unfavorable factors were partly offset by the expiration of royalties on certain of our swine testing products.   ﻿   Other. Gross profit for Other increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage from 50% to 53%. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower overall OPTI Medical product costs, partly offset by lower average unit sales prices on OPTI Medical instruments and related consumables.    ﻿   Unallocated Amounts. Gross profit for Unallocated Amounts decreased due primarily to higher personnel-related costs.    ﻿   We estimate certain personnel-related costs and allocate the budgeted expenses to the operating segments. This allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” The increase in personnel-related costs was due primarily to higher self-insured healthcare costs and higher than budgeted employee incentives reported within Unallocated Amounts during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the same period of the prior year.   ﻿   Operating Expenses and Operating Income        Total Company.

Research and development expense for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was generally consistent with the same period of the prior year.       Other. Operating expenses for Other, which totaled $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, increased $1.0 million as compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to an intangible impairment within our OPTI Medical business.   ﻿   During the first quarter of 2016, management reviewed our OPTI Medical product offerings. As a result of this review, we discontinued our product development activities in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market during March 2016 and instead will focus our commercial efforts in this market on supporting our latest generation OPTI CCA-TS2 Blood Gas and Electrolyte Analyzer.   ﻿   We assessed the realizability of the related tangible and intangible assets as a result of the aforementioned change in strategy and determined the expected future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the asset group. As a result, we recorded a non-cash intangible asset impairment of $1.1 million within our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016.        Unallocated Amounts. Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased $3.0 million to $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, due primarily to higher personnel-related costs.    ﻿   We estimate certain personnel-related costs and allocate these budgeted expenses to the operating segments. This allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” Higher personnel related costs during the three months ended March 31, 2016 were the result of increased employee incentives and higher self-insured healthcare costs. Additionally, during the three months ended March 31, 2015, operating expenses reported in Unallocated Amounts benefitted from favorability due to cost control initiatives enacted subsequent to the development of our 2015 budget.        27       Interest Income and Interest Expense        Interest income was $0.8 million and $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in interest income was due primarily to a larger relative portfolio of marketable securities during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the same period of the prior year.        Interest expense was $8.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to $6.3 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to approximately $250 million in senior notes that we issued and sold through private placements during 2015, for which fixed interest rates range from 1.785% to 3.72% and higher relative interest rates on our unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the same period of the prior year. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 Annual Report for additional information regarding our senior notes and Credit Facility.        Provision for Income Taxes        Our effective income tax rate was 30.6% and 30.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in our effective rate for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the same period of the prior year was related to lower relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partly offset by the benefit of the U.S. research and development (“R&D”) tax credit. There was no available U.S. R&D tax credit during the period ending March 31, 2015 because the credit had not yet been extended. In December 2015, the U.S. R&D tax credit was permanently extended with retroactive application to January 1, 2015.    ﻿     §    Recent Accounting Pronouncements       We are evaluating the impact that several recent accounting amendments related to share-based payment transactions, leases, and revenue recognition will have on our consolidated financial statements. Other recently issued accounting pronouncements did not have and are not expected to have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations.   ﻿   Liquidity and Capital Resources        Liquidity        We fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, proceeds from long-term senior note financings and amounts available under our $850 million Credit Facility. At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $350.6 million and $342.6 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Working capital, including our Credit Facility, totaled negative $69.7 million and negative $35.1 million, respectively, at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Additionally, at March 31, 2016, we had remaining borrowing availability of $227 million under our $850 million Credit Facility. We believe that, if necessary, we could obtain additional borrowings at similar rates to our existing borrowings to fund our growth objectives. We further believe that current cash and cash equivalents, our portfolio of short-duration marketable securities, funds generated from operations and committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital purchase requirements, and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months. We believe that these resources, coupled with our ability, as needed, to obtain additional financing on favorable terms will also be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our business as currently conducted.   ﻿   We consider the majority of the operating earnings of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. No provision has been made for the payment of U.S. federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Changes to this position could have adverse tax consequences. A determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable for several reasons, including the complexity of laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we operate, the varying tax treatment of potential repatriation scenarios and the timing of any future repatriation. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries. Our foreign cash and marketable securities are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the U.S.    ﻿       28          Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at March 31, 2016, approximately $348.4 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was subject to material repatriation tax effects. We held marketable securities with original maturities of three years or less that had an average AA- credit rating as of March 31, 2016. Of the $217.6 million in marketable securities held as of March 31, 2016 approximately 70% of the fair value of our marketable securities consisted of corporate bonds, 11% consisted of asset backed securities, with the remainder consisting of agency bonds, U.S. and Canadian government bonds, municipal bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. Of the $133.0 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of March 31, 2016, 91% was held as bank deposits, 6% was invested in money market funds invested in highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities and the remainder was invested in commercial paper and agency bonds with original maturities of less than ninety days and money market funds restricted to U.S. government and agency securities. As of March 31, 2016, approximately 68% of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries was held in U.S. dollars.   ﻿   Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense and other dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and believe we will continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates.

The total of changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements decreased cash by $50.5 million and $83.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulting in an incremental increase in cash of $32.7 million.            29          The following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements:    ﻿      ﻿                                              ﻿        For the Three Months Ended March 31,      (dollars in thousands)      2016 				     2015 				       Dollar Change          ﻿                                              Accounts receivable        $  (21,504) 				       $  (51,438) 				       $  29,934 				         Inventories          1,764 				         (10,142) 				         11,906 				         Accounts payable          (1,801) 				         (4,332) 				         2,531 				         Deferred revenue          637 				         1,153 				         (516) 				         Other assets and liabilities          (27,516) 				         (10,746) 				         (16,770) 				         Tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements          (2,063) 				         (7,713) 				         5,650 				         Total change in cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements        $  (50,483) 				       $  (83,218) 				       $  32,735 				            The decrease in cash used by accounts receivable during the three months ended March 31, 2016 resulted from the absence of one-time impacts related to our change in U.S. commercial strategy beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our transition to an all-direct strategy in the U.S., including the establishment of accounts receivable directly with our U.S. end-users that previously purchased from our U.S. distribution partners, resulted in a significant use of cash during the first quarter of 2015. Cash provided by inventory during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to cash used during the same period in the prior year, was the result of operational initiatives to optimize inventory levels. Higher incremental cash used by other assets and liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the same period of the prior year was due primarily to higher relative cash paid for payroll as a result of the timing of quarter end relative to payment dates, as well as due to the timing of other prepaid and accrued expenses.       We have historically experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vector-borne disease testing, which has historically resulted in significant increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year.   ﻿   Investing Activities. Cash used by investing activities was $23.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to $160.6 million for the same period of the prior year. The decrease in cash used by investing activities was due primarily to lower relative net purchases of marketable securities during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the same period of the prior year.       Our total capital expenditure plan for 2016 is estimated to be approximately $90 million, which includes capital investments in manufacturing and reference laboratory equipment, investments in internal use software and information technology infrastructure and the renovation and expansion of our facilities and reference laboratories.   ﻿   Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to cash provided of $36.8 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was due to the absence of a long-term debt issuance in the first quarter of 2016, as compared to the aggregate issuance of approximately $150 million of senior notes during the same period of the prior year, partly offset by a decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock and higher relative net borrowings under the Credit Facility during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year.   ﻿   Cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock decreased $80.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year. From the inception of our share repurchase program in August 1999 to March 31, 2016, we have repurchased 58.9 million shares. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we purchased 0.7 million shares for an aggregate cost of $49.7 million, as compared to purchases of 1.8 million shares for an aggregate cost of $133.6 million during the same period of the prior year. Share repurchases have moderated relative to the same period of the prior year as we have achieved a debt leverage ratio consistent with our long-term target range. We believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price. See Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information about our share repurchases.   ﻿       30          Net borrowing and repayment activity under the Credit Facility resulted in incremental cash provided of $48.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year. At March 31, 2016, we had $622.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The general availability of funds under the Credit Facility was further reduced by $1.0 million for a letter of credit that was issued in connection with claims under our workers’ compensation policy. The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations. The obligations under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the failure to pay specified indebtedness, cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness and a change of control default.   ﻿   Since December 2013, we have issued and sold through private placements senior notes having an aggregate principal amount of approximately $600 million pursuant to certain note purchase agreements (collectively, the “Senior Note Agreements”). The Senior Note Agreements contain affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for agreements of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of our subsidiaries, priority indebtedness, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 Annual Report for additional information regarding our senior notes.   ﻿   Should we elect to prepay the senior notes, such aggregate prepayment will include the applicable make-whole amount(s), as defined within the applicable Senior Note Agreements. Additionally, in the event of a change in control of the Company or upon the disposition of certain assets of the Company the proceeds of which are not reinvested (as defined in the Senior Note Agreements), we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the Senior Notes. The obligations under the Senior Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the applicable Senior Note Agreement, each of which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the failure to pay specified indebtedness and cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness.   ﻿   The sole financial covenant of our Credit Facility and Senior Note Agreements is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other non-cash charges (“Adjusted EBITDA”) not to exceed 3.5-to-1. At March 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility and Senior Note Agreements.

Management believes that reporting these non-GAAP financial measures provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate our business performance and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility.    ﻿   Other Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees        Significant commitments, contingencies and guarantees at March 31, 2016 are consistent with those discussed in the section under the heading “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 Annual Report.        Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk        For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting IDEXX, see the section under the heading “Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of our 2015 Annual Report. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the market risks described in our 2015 Annual Report.    ﻿    Item 4. Controls and Procedures        Disclosure Controls and Procedures        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by the SEC in its Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures at March 31, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.        Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting        There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended March 31, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.        PART II — OTHER INFORMATION        Item 1. Legal Proceedings   ﻿   Due to the nature of our activities, we are at times subject to pending and threatened legal actions that arise out of the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, based in part upon advice of legal counsel, the disposition of any such currently pending matters is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, it is possible that our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more legal actions.   ﻿       32          Item 1A. Risk Factors        In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our 2015 Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report. The risks described in our 2015 Annual Report are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.   ﻿   Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
