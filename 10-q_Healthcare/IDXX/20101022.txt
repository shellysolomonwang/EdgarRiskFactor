Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The risks and uncertainties discussed herein do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions or dispositions. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our estimates only as of the day this Quarterly Report was first filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements may also be included in other materials released to the public. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates or expectations change.  ■ Business Overview and Trends  Operating segments. We operate primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information technology products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”) and products for livestock and poultry health, which we refer to as Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics (“LPD”). Until the second quarter of 2010, LPD was referred to as our Production Animal Segment. We also operate two smaller operating segments that comprise products for dairy quality (“Dairy”) and products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market (“OPTI Medical”). Financial information about the Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments and other licensing arrangements are combined and presented in an “Other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. See Note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for financial information about our segments and the section entitled “Description of Business by Segment” under the heading “Item 1. Business” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 for additional description of our segments.  CAG develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products and performs services for veterinarians, primarily related to diagnostics and information management. Water develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in water. LPD develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect disease in livestock and poultry. Dairy develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in dairy products. OPTI Medical develops, designs, manufactures and distributes point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human medical diagnostics market and also manufactures our VetStat® electrolyte and blood gas analyzer and electrolyte consumables used with our Catalyst Dx® analyzer, both of which are sold in the veterinary market.  Items that are not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories, a portion of share-based compensation expense, interest income and expense, and income taxes. We estimate our share-based compensation expense for the year and allocate the estimated expense to the operating segments. This allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference between the total allocated share-based compensation expense and the actual expense for the total company, resulting in an unallocated amount reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” We maintain active research and development programs, some of which may materialize into the development and introduction of new technology, products or services. Research and development costs incurred that are not specifically attributable to one of our existing business or service categories are reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.”       20           Use of Distributors. The instrument consumables and rapid assay products in our CAG segment are sold in the U.S. and certain other geographies by distributors. As a result, distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products. Distributors purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices, who are the end users. Distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and may be unrelated to underlying end-user demand for our products. As a result, fluctuations in distributors’ inventories may cause reported results in a period not to be representative of underlying end-user demand. Therefore, we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of end-user demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue.  Where growth rates are affected by changes in end-user demand, we refer to the impact of practice-level sales on growth. Where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics, we refer to the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories. If during the current year, distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year, then changes in distributors’ inventories have a negative impact on our reported sales growth in the current period. Conversely, if during the current year, distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year, then changes in distributors’ inventories have a positive impact on our reported sales growth in the current period.  At the end of a quarter, we believe that our U.S. CAG distributors typically hold inventory equivalent to approximately three to four weeks of our anticipated end-user demand for instrument consumables and rapid assay products.  Currency Impact. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, approximately 24% and 25% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local currencies. Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally, with a weakening of the U.S. dollar having the opposite effect. In addition, to the extent that the U.S. dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods, our growth rate will be negatively affected. The impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offset this exposure.  During the three months ended September 30, 2010, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2009, changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced total company revenue by approximately $3.2 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and, to a lesser extent, the British pound. The impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is a non-U.S. GAAP measure. It represents the change resulting from the difference between the average exchange rates during the current period and the same period of the prior year applied to foreign currency denominated revenues for the current period. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen. These changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted the revenues generated by each of our individual operating segments in a manner similar to the impact on the company as a whole.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2009, changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total company revenue by approximately $5.7 million, due primarily to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Japanese yen. These favorable impacts were partly offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. Although the changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a net favorable impact on total company revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, our LPD segment was negatively impacted since the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Euro and, compared to our other segments, a larger portion of LPD sales are generated in countries where the Euro is the local currency.         21          Effect of Economic Conditions. Demand for many of our products and services has been negatively affected by economic conditions that have existed over the past two years. In our CAG segment, we believe that negative consumer sentiment resulting from economic conditions has led to essentially flat patient visits to veterinary clinics, which we continued to observe for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 relative to the same periods in 2009. We also believe that essentially flat patient visits have negatively affected the growth rate of sales of rapid assay tests, instrument consumables, and laboratory diagnostic and consulting services. In addition, we believe that the rate of growth of sales of our instruments and digital radiography systems, which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians, has been negatively affected by continued caution among veterinarians regarding economic conditions. Weaker economic conditions have also caused our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services resulting in lower growth due to limited price increases for certain products.  We also believe that current economic conditions have affected purchasing decisions by certain customer groups in our Water and LPD businesses. Lower water testing volumes in the regulated and non-regulated segments of our Water business have resulted from a decline in municipal studies and new home construction, respectively. Lower LPD testing volumes have resulted from a reduction in non-regulated producer and laboratory testing, as a measure to reduce operating costs, and by a reduction in testing associated with some government mandated eradication programs as a result of lower government funding.  We believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets will partially mitigate the effects of the continuing slow economic growth and negative consumer sentiment. However, until we see improvements in broad factors that measure the economic climate both in the United States and Europe, we expect our growth rates will continue to be negatively affected.  ■ Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant accounting policies used in preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 are consistent with those discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, except as discussed in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The critical accounting policies and the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 are consistent with those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 in the section under the heading “Part 2, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”         22           ■ Results of Operations  Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2009  Revenue  Total Company.

(3)   We refer to this change as the change in organic revenue.      The following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue, which reflects the results of operations net of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. and net of incremental revenues from businesses acquired or revenues lost from businesses divested or discontinued subsequent to June 30, 2009.

It represents the percentage change in revenue resulting from the difference between the average exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2010 and the same period of the prior year applied to foreign currency denominated revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2010.         (2)   Represents the percentage change in revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2009 attributed to incremental revenues from businesses acquired or revenues lost from businesses divested or discontinued subsequent to June 30, 2009.         (3)   We refer to this change as the change in organic revenue.           23           Instruments revenue was $21.1 million and $18.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Consumables revenue was $57.0 million and $55.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Instrument service and accessories revenue was $10.2 million and $9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The remaining sources of revenue are not significant to overall instruments and consumables revenue. The $2.4 million increase in instruments revenue was due primarily to sales of our ProCyte DxTM instrument, our new hematology analyzer that we began shipping during the third quarter of 2010, and increased sales of our Catalyst Dx® instrument. The revenue generated from sales of our ProCyte DxTM instrument was partly offset by lower sales volumes of our LaserCyte® instrument as some of our sales focus has shifted from LaserCyte® to ProCyte DxTM. The $1.1 million increase in consumables revenue was due primarily to higher sales volumes of consumables used with our Catalyst Dx® instrument, partly offset by lower sales of consumables used with our VetTest® instrument as certain customers have replaced VetTest® instruments with Catalyst Dx® instruments. The $1.1 million increase in instrument service and accessories revenue was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments. The impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels decreased reported instruments and consumables revenue growth by 1%.   The decrease in rapid assay revenue was due primarily to the unfavorable impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels, which reduced revenue growth by 5%. Lower average unit sales prices of our SNAP® tests, resulting from discounts associated with customer purchase programs, and lower sales volumes of our Feline SNAP® tests also contributed to the decrease in rapid assay revenue. These factors were partly offset by the favorable impact of changes in significant marketing programs and higher sales volumes of our SNAP® tests in our Europe region.   The increase in laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted primarily from the impact of higher testing volumes, which were driven largely by the acquisition of new customers.  Practice information management systems and digital radiography revenue decreased slightly as an increase in service and support revenue was more than offset by lower average unit sales prices for our companion animal digital radiography systems and lower sales volumes of our equine digital radiography systems.  Water. The increase in Water revenue resulted primarily from higher Quanti-Tray® and Colilert® product sales volume and the impact of higher relative sales of Colilert® products in geographies where these products are sold at higher average unit sales prices.  Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics. The increase in LPD revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of certain swine tests and higher sales volumes of certain bovine tests in Germany, where we have won several government tenders for testing in connection with a country-wide eradication program for a virus impacting beef and dairy production yields. The growth rate was also driven by lower revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2009 in comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2010 due to the timing of sales orders. These increases were partly offset by lower average unit sales prices due to competitive pressures.  Other. The increase in Other revenue was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes of our Dairy SNAP® residue test for the detection of melamine and higher sales volumes of consumables used with our OPTI Medical instruments. These increases were partly offset by unfavorable sales volumes of our Dairy SNAP® Beta Lactam test used for the detection of antibiotic residue in milk.  Gross Profit  Total Company. The following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment:         For the Three Months Ended September 30,       Gross Profit (dollars in thousands)     2010       Percent of Revenue       2009       Percent of Revenue       Dollar Change       Percentage Change                                               CAG    $ 113,561       50.9  %   $ 105,234       49.1  %   $ 8,327       7.9  %    Water      12,628       63.0  %     12,251       62.2  %     377       3.1  %    LPD      11,446       65.5  %     9,257       58.1  %     2,189       23.6  %    Other      4,579       49.8  %     3,721       41.2  %     858       23.0  %    Unallocated amounts      (7  )     N/A       14       N/A       (21  )     (150.0  )%     Total Company    $ 142,207       52.7  %   $ 130,477       50.4  %   $ 11,730       9.0  %               24           Companion Animal Group. Gross profit for CAG increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 51% from 49%. The increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to reduced overall manufacturing costs associated with our IDEXX VetLab® instruments and SNAP® tests. The gross profit percentage was also favorably impacted by lower costs of service in our laboratory and consulting services business and lower depreciation on our IDEXX VetLab® instruments placed at customer sites under usage agreements, as we have reduced this type of placement activity and an increasing number of prior placements have become fully depreciated. These favorable impacts were partly offset by the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher relative sales of lower margin products. The net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and, to a lesser extent, against the British pound, as a substantial portion of CAG sales outside of the U.S. are denominated in the Euro and the British pound.  Water. Gross profit for Water increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 63% from 62%. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due to lower overall manufacturing costs, partly offset by the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and greater hedging losses.  Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics. Gross profit for LPD increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 65% from 58%. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due to lower overall manufacturing costs, due primarily to greater volume leverage, and higher relative sales of higher margin products. The gross profit percentage of 65% is relatively consistent with full year 2008 and 2009 results. The gross profit percentage of 58% for the three months ended September 30, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2010 was depressed due primarily to the impact of increased manufacturing costs and to lower revenue recognized related to a customer where revenue is recognized on the cash basis of accounting due to uncertain collectability.  Other. Gross profit for Other operating units increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 50% from 41%. The increase in the gross profit percentage was attributable to lower overall manufacturing costs in our OPTI Medical and Dairy lines of business and higher royalty revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2010 as compared to the same period of the prior year.

The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from increased legal fees incurred in connection with our response to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) subpoena discussed in more detail under the heading “Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q; an increase in bad debt expense in connection with the bankruptcy of one of our U.S. distributors, Professional Veterinary Products, Inc (“PVP”); and, to a lesser extent, increased personnel-related costs. These increases were partly offset by the favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased personnel-related costs.  Water.

The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from an increase in costs attributable to investments in information technology and, to a lesser extent, an increase in personnel-related costs, partly offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in research and development expense resulted primarily from decreased spending related to qualifying additional suppliers of certain raw materials and a reduction in personnel-related costs.  Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics. The following table presents LPD operating expenses by functional area:                    For the Three Months Ended September 30,      Operating Expenses (dollars in thousands)     2010       Percent of  Revenue       2009       Percent of  Revenue       Dollar  Change       Percentage  Change                                               Sales and marketing    $ 3,118       17.8 %   $ 2,946       18.5 %   $ 172       5.8 %    General and administrative      2,608       14.9 %     3,104       19.5 %     (496 )     (16.0 )%    Research and development      2,678       15.3 %     2,263       14.2 %     415       18.3 %    Total operating expenses    $ 8,404       48.1 %   $ 8,313       52.1 %   $ 91       1.1 %                   The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased personnel-related costs and, to a lesser extent, marketing and branding expense incurred as part of the renaming of our LPD segment in the second quarter of 2010. The decrease in general and administrative expense resulted from a decrease in personnel-related costs and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These favorable items were partly offset by an increase in costs attributable to investments in information technology. The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from an increase in personnel-related costs.       26           Other. Operating expenses for Other operating units decreased $0.8 million to $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010 due primarily to a milestone payment earned related to the sale of product rights previously included in our pharmaceutical division. This payment was earned due to the achievement of certain sales milestones by the third party that purchased the product rights. Because we have no obligation to deliver product or services, or otherwise provide support to the third party under this agreement, and because collectability is reasonably assured, this milestone payment, and any other related milestone payments we earn in the future, are included in results of operations when earned, but are not classified as revenue because the transaction was accounted for as the sale of a product line. See Note 16 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding this milestone payment. This decrease was partly offset by increased sales and marketing costs in China due to the development of our Dairy business in that country.  Unallocated Amounts. Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments decreased $0.8 million to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010 due primarily to lower corporate research and development personnel-related costs.  Interest Income and Interest Expense  Interest income was $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and less than $0.1 million for the same period in the prior year. The slight increase was due primarily to higher interest rates on invested cash balances.  Interest expense was $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010, compared to $0.4 million for the same period in 2009. In March 2009, we entered into two forward fixed interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount of $80 million to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations on amounts borrowed under the terms of our unsecured short-term revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”). Under these agreements, we effectively fixed our interest rate exposure on $80 million of our outstanding borrowings for the period commencing March 31, 2010 through March 30, 2012 by converting our variable interest rate payments to fixed interest rate payments at 2% plus applicable interest rates on funds borrowed under the Credit Facility, which range from 0.375 to 0.875 percentage points (the “Credit Spread”). The increase in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period of the prior year was due to higher effective interest rates on outstanding debt balances due to the commencement of these interest rate swap agreements, partly offset by lower average balances outstanding on our Credit Facility. As the fixed rate under the interest rate swap agreements is higher than the weighted average interest rate of debt outstanding during 2009, we expect that interest expense will continue to be higher during the remainder of 2010 as compared to 2009.  Provision for Income Taxes  Our effective income tax rates were 29.5% and 28.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in our effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period of the prior year was due primarily to the expiration of federal research and development tax incentives that were available during the three months ended September 30, 2009, partly offset by tax benefits related to U.S. manufacturing activities that were fully phased in effective January 1, 2010. During the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, we recognized tax benefits of similar amounts resulting from the expiration of certain statutes of limitation. The recognition of these benefits did not impact the comparability of our effective income tax rate between the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, but did result in the reduction of our effective income tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.       27          Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009  Revenue  Total Company.

(3)   We refer to this change as the change in organic revenue.             28          Instruments revenue was $57.5 million and $51.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Consumables revenue was $170.7 million and $161.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Instrument service and accessories revenue was $29.4 million and $26.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The remaining sources of revenue are not significant to overall instruments and consumables revenue. The $5.6 million increase in instruments revenue was due primarily to higher sales volumes of our Catalyst Dx® instrument, sales of our ProCyte DxTM instrument, our new hematology analyzer that we began shipping during the third quarter of 2010, and increased sales of our IDEXX VetLab Station®. The increase in revenue attributable to sales of our ProCyte DxTM instrument was partly offset by lower average unit sales prices and lower sales volumes of our LaserCyte® instrument as some of our sales focus has shifted from LaserCyte® to ProCyte DxTM. The $9.5 million increase in consumables revenue was due primarily to higher sales volumes of consumables used with our Catalyst Dx® instrument, partly offset by lower sales of consumables used with our VetTest® instrument as certain customers have replaced VetTest® instruments with Catalyst Dx® instruments. The $3.4 million increase in instrument service and accessories revenue was primarily a result of the growth of our active installed base of instruments. The impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels increased reported instruments and consumables revenue growth by 1%.  The decrease in rapid assay revenue was due primarily to lower average unit sales prices of our SNAP® tests, resulting from discounts associated with customer purchase programs. Lower sales volumes of our SNAP® tests, attributable to a decline in U.S. practice-level sales, partly offset by higher sales volume outside of the U.S., also contributed to the decrease in rapid assay revenue. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by changes in distributors’ inventory levels, which resulted in an increase in reported rapid assay revenue growth of 1%.  The increase in laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted primarily from the impact of higher testing volumes, which were driven largely by the acquisition of new customers.  The increase in practice information management systems and digital radiography revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of companion animal radiography systems as this market is transitioning from older film-based systems to digital as the standard of care. An increase in service and support revenue also contributed to revenue growth.   Water. The increase in Water revenue resulted primarily from higher Colilert® product sales volume. This favorable impact was partly offset by higher relative sales of Colilert® products in geographies where these products are sold at lower average unit sales prices.  Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics. The increase in LPD revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of certain bovine tests in Germany where we have won several government tenders for testing in connection with a country-wide eradication program for a virus impacting beef and dairy production yields, partly offset by lower average unit sales prices due to competitive pressures. Higher sales volumes of certain swine tests also contributed to revenue growth.  Other. The increase in Other revenue was attributable primarily to higher sales volumes of our Dairy SNAP® residue test for the detection of melamine and higher sales volume of consumables used with our OPTI Medical instruments. These increases were partly offset by lower sales of our Dairy SNAP® Beta Lactam test used for the detection of antibiotic residue in milk and lower Dairy instrument sales volume.  Gross Profit  Total Company.

Gross profit for CAG increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 51% from 50%. The increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to lower overall manufacturing and service costs associated with our IDEXX VetLab® instruments and, to a lesser extent, lower depreciation on instruments placed at customer sites under usage agreements, as we have reduced this type of placement activity and an increasing number of prior placements have become fully depreciated. The gross profit percentage was also favorably impacted by lower costs of service in our laboratory and consulting services business. These favorable impacts were partly offset by the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher relative sales of lower margin products. The net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was due primarily to lower hedging gains, partly offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar.  Water. The slight increase in gross profit for Water was due to higher sales, largely offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 63% from 66%. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was due to the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher overall manufacturing costs. The net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was due to lower hedging gains, partly offset by the impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by higher relative sales of higher margin products.  Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics. Gross profit for LPD increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 67% from 66%. The increase in the gross profit percentage resulted from higher relative sales of higher margin products and lower overall manufacturing costs, partly offset by the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower overall average unit sales prices. The net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was due to lower hedging gains and the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro.  Other. Gross profit for Other operating units increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 45% from 42%. The increase in the gross profit percentage was attributable to higher royalty revenues, lower overall manufacturing costs in our Dairy line of business, and lower relative sales of lower margin Dairy instruments. These increases were partly offset by the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due primarily to lower hedging gains.

The following table presents Water expenses by functional area:                  For the Nine Months Ended September 30,       Operating Expenses (dollars in thousands)     2010       Percent of Revenue       2009       Percent of Revenue       Dollar Change       Percentage Change                                               Sales and marketing    $ 5,711       10.0  %   $ 5,306       9.7  %   $ 405       7.6  %    General and administrative      4,791       8.4  %     4,266       7.8  %     525       12.3  %    Research and development      1,831       3.2  %     2,053       3.8  %     (222  )     (10.8  )%    Total operating expenses    $ 12,333       21.5  %   $ 11,625       21.2  %   $ 708       6.1  %                 The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased personnel-related costs, partly offset by lower spending on market research. The increase in general and administrative expense resulted from an increase in costs attributable to information technology investments and the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in research and development expense resulted primarily from a reduction in personnel-related costs and, to a lesser extent, from decreased spending related to qualifying additional suppliers of certain raw materials.  Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics. The following table presents LPD operating expenses by functional area:              For the Nine Months Ended September 30,       Operating Expenses (dollars in thousands)     2010       Percent of Revenue       2009       Percent of Revenue       Dollar Change       Percentage Change                                               Sales and marketing    $ 9,951       17.6  %   $ 8,994       16.7  %   $ 957       10.6  %    General and administrative      9,078       16.0  %     9,217       17.1  %     (139  )     (1.5  )%    Research and development      7,032       12.4  %     6,451       12.0  %     581       9.0  %    Total operating expenses    $ 26,061       46.1  %   $ 24,662       45.8  %   $ 1,399       5.7  %             The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from an increase in personnel-related costs. The decrease in general and administrative expense resulted from a decrease in personnel-related costs, partly offset by an increase in costs attributable to information technology investments. The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from an increase in personnel-related costs, partly offset by lower spending due to the timing of certain projects.  Other. Operating expenses for Other operating units decreased $0.5 million to $11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 due primarily to a milestone payment earned as described in the results of operations discussion for the three months ended September 30, 2010, and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in deferred compensation expense associated with an employee plan assumed in our acquisition of OPTI Medical, due to changes in the market value of the underlying investments in the plan. These decreases were partly offset by increased personnel-related costs in our OPTI Medical and Dairy lines of business.       31           Unallocated Amounts. Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments decreased $2.4 million to $8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 due primarily to lower corporate research and development personnel-related costs and the write-off in 2009 of software to manage the various aspects of product development and product life cycles.  Interest Income and Interest Expense  Interest income was $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 as a decrease in interest rates was offset by higher invested cash balances.  Interest expense was $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and $1.5 million for the same period in 2009. The increase in interest expense was due to higher effective interest rates, partly offset by lower average balances outstanding on our Credit Facility. With the commencement of our interest rate swap agreements on March 31, 2010, we effectively fixed our interest rate at 2% plus the Credit Spread on $80 million of funds borrowed under the Credit Facility through March 31, 2012. As the fixed rate under the interest rate swap agreements is higher than the weighted average interest rate of debt outstanding during 2009, we expect that interest expense will continue to be higher during the remainder of 2010 as compared to 2009.  Provision for Income Taxes  Our effective income tax rates were 30.8% and 30.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period of the prior year was due primarily to the expiration of federal research and development tax incentives that were available during the nine months ended September 30, 2009, partly offset by tax benefits related to U.S. manufacturing activities that were fully phased in effective January 1, 2010.  ■ Recent Accounting Pronouncements  A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 3(p) to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  ■ Liquidity and Capital Resources  Liquidity  We fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, and amounts available under the Credit Facility. At September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, we had $133.5 million and $106.7 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, and working capital of $159.0 million and $120.0 million, respectively. Additionally, at September 30, 2010, we had remaining borrowing availability of $73.1 million under our $200 million Credit Facility. We believe that, if necessary, we could obtain additional borrowings at prevailing market interest rates to fund our growth objectives. We further believe that current cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operations, and available borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital purchase requirements, and strategic growth needs for the next twelve months, and that these resources will be sufficient in the long-term to fund our business as currently being conducted.  We consider the operating earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. Changes to this position could have adverse tax consequences. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries. Our foreign cash balances are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the U.S. As the majority of our cash is invested outside of the U.S., we expect to continue to utilize amounts available under our Credit Facility to fund our operations in the U.S. As a result, we expect our cash balance to continue to grow for the foreseeable future as sources of foreign cash flows are expected to be greater than uses outside of the U.S.         32           The following table presents additional key information concerning working capital:              For the Three Months Ended         September 30, 2010     June 30,  2010     March 31, 2010     December 31, 2009     September 30, 2009                                         Days sales outstanding(1)      41.9       41.8       41.7       38.9       41.2      Inventory turns(2)      1.7       1.9       2.0       1.9       1.8             (1) Days sales outstanding represents the average of the accounts receivable balances at the beginning and end of each quarter divided by revenue for that quarter, the result of which is then multiplied by 91.25 days. (2) Inventory turns represents inventory-related cost of product sales for the 12 months preceding each quarter-end divided by the inventory balance at the end of the quarter.  Sources and Uses of Cash  The following table presents cash provided (used):            For the Nine Months Ended September 30,       (dollars in thousands)     2010       2009       Dollar Change                             Net cash provided by operating activities    $ 129,983     $ 115,503     $ 14,480      Net cash used by investing activities      (28,804  )     (39,609  )     10,805      Net cash used by financing activities      (75,279  )     (50,540  )     (24,739  )    Net effect of changes in exchange rates on cash      884       2,506       (1,622  )    Net increase in cash and cash equivalents    $ 26,784     $ 27,860     $ (1,076 )       Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $130.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to $115.5 million for the same period in 2009. The total of net income and net non-cash charges, excluding the impact of reclassifying the tax benefit from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units to a financing activity, was $153.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to $144.6 million for the same period in 2009, resulting in incremental operating cash flows of $8.8 million. The total of changes in operating assets and liabilities, and the tax benefit from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units decreased cash by $23.4 million and $29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, resulting in an incremental increase in cash of $5.7 million.  The following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities, and the tax benefit from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units:            For the Nine Months Ended September 30,       (dollars in thousands)     2010       2009       Dollar Change                             Accounts receivable    $ (6,916 )   $ (1,132 )   $ (5,784 )    Inventories      (22,460  )     (8,145  )     (14,315  )    Other assets      (5,836  )     (3,126  )     (2,710  )    Accounts payable      6,107       (6,868  )     12,975      Accrued liabilities      16,447       (5,241  )     21,688      Deferred revenue      2,570       (698  )     3,268      Tax benefit from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units      (13,293  )     (3,851  )     (9,442  )     Total change in cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units    $ (23,381 )   $ (29,061 )   $ 5,680         During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, as compared to the same period of the prior year, the increase in accrued liabilities resulted primarily from increased income tax accruals. The timing of inventory receipts, most significantly of slides used with our chemistry analyzers, contributed to a decrease in cash flow, which was partly offset by associated increases in cash flow from the timing of payments for inventory. Sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 were higher compared to the same period of the prior year, driving increases in accounts receivable.   We historically have experienced proportionally lower or net negative cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher or net positive cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period. Several factors contribute to the seasonal fluctuations in cash flows generated by operating activities, including the following:       33                    ·   Accounts receivable are historically higher in the first quarter of the year due to seasonality of certain products.               ·   We have management and non-management employee incentive programs that provide for the payment of annual bonuses in the first quarter following the year in which the bonuses were earned.               ·   We have agreements with certain suppliers that require us to make minimum annual inventory purchases, in some cases in order to retain exclusive distribution rights, and we have other agreements with suppliers that provide for lower pricing based on annual purchase volumes. We may place a higher volume of purchase orders for inventory during the fourth quarter in order to meet our minimum commitments or realize volume pricing discounts and we receive that inventory in the fourth or first quarters and pay in the first quarter. The specific facts and circumstances that we consider in determining the timing and level of inventory purchases throughout the year related to these agreements may yield inconsistent cash flows from operations, most typically in the first and fourth quarters. The timing of inventory receipts also impacts our inventory turnover metrics. To the extent we receive large inventory shipments at the end of a quarter our inventory turnover will be negatively affected.      Investing Activities. Cash used by investing activities was $28.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to cash used of $39.6 million for the same period of 2009. The decrease in cash used by investing activities was due primarily to a decrease in cash used for fixed asset purchases due to lower spending on the renovation of our headquarters facilities and information technology projects, and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in cash used for acquisitions. These decreases in cash used were partly offset by lower proceeds received in connection with the disposition of assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2010. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we received net proceeds of $3.4 million from the sale of our pharmaceutical product lines and from the sale of property and equipment.  We paid $28.6 million to purchase fixed assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Our total capital expenditure plan for 2010 is approximately $45 million, which includes approximately $9 million for the renovation and expansion of our headquarters facility.  Financing Activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, we received $22.1 million and $13.1 million, respectively, on the exercise of stock options and participation in the employee stock purchase plan, due to an increase in the number of options exercised and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the weighted average exercise price. Exercise activity increased during the first nine months of 2010 as compared to the same period of the prior year partly due to the adoption by our chief executive officer of a securities trading plan designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a function of the increase in exercise activity, the tax benefit from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units increased to $13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to $3.9 million for the same period of the prior year.  At September 30, 2010, we had $125.9 million outstanding under the Credit Facility, of which $2.9 million was borrowed by our Canadian subsidiary and denominated in Canadian dollars. The general availability of funds under the Credit Facility is reduced by $1.0 million for a letter of credit issued related to our workers’ compensation policy covering claims for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010. The Credit Facility contains financial and other affirmative and negative covenants, as well as customary events of default, which provide for the acceleration of amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, or restrict our ability to borrow thereunder, in the event of noncompliance. One of the financial covenants requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, defined as the consolidated leverage ratio under the terms of the Credit Facility, not to exceed 3-to-1. At September 30, 2010, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility.  Our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 44 million shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. From the inception of the program in August 1999 to September 30, 2010, we have repurchased 39.8 million shares. Cash used to repurchase shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 was $117.2 million and $58.0 million, respectively. We believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable investment, and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price.       34           Other Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees  Significant commitments, contingencies and guarantees at September 30, 2010 are consistent with those discussed in the section under the heading “Part 2, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting IDEXX, see the section under the heading “Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. As of the date of this report, there have been no material changes to the market risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.  Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by the SEC in its Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures at September 30, 2010, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to achieve their stated purpose.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2010 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  PART II — OTHER INFORMATION  Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.  The following discussion includes three revised risk factors (“Various Government Regulations and Enforcement Activities Could Limit or Delay Our Ability to Market and Sell Our Products,” “Changes in Testing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results,” and “Our Operations are Vulnerable to Interruption as a Result of Natural Disasters or System Failures”) that reflect developments subsequent to the discussion of those risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and we have eliminated one risk factor (“Disruptions in Financial and Currency Markets Could Have a Negative Effect on Our Business”), which was included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.       35           Our Failure to Successfully Execute Certain Strategies Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Growth and Profitability  The companion animal health care industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increased competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants. Our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy, which include:          ·   Developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative new in-clinic laboratory analyzers that drive sales of IDEXX VetLab® instruments, grow our installed base of instruments, and create a recurring revenue stream from consumable products, services and accessories;               ·   Developing and introducing new proprietary diagnostic tests and services that provide valuable medical information to our customers and effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;               ·   Increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of these products and managing the diagnostic information derived from our products;               ·   Achieving the benefits of economies of scale in our worldwide network of laboratories;               ·   Achieving cost reductions in the manufacture and service of our in-clinic laboratory analyzers;               ·   Expanding our served market and growing our market share by strengthening our sales and marketing activities both within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the U.S.;               ·   Developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies; and               ·   Identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business or geographic areas for us.      If we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of these strategies, our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted.  Our Dependence on a Limited Number of Suppliers Could Limit Our Ability to Sell Certain Products or Reduce Our Profitability  We currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products include our ProCyte Dx™ hematology, IDEXX VetAutoread™ hematology, VetLyte® electrolyte, IDEXX VetLab® UA™ urinalysis, VetTest® chemistry, and Coag Dx™ blood coagulation analyzers and related consumables and accessories; image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems; Catalyst Dx® and VetTest® consumables; and certain components and raw materials used in our SNAP® rapid assay devices, water testing products, dairy testing products and LaserCyte® hematology analyzers. To mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we seek where possible to enter into long-term contracts that ensure an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices. However, some suppliers decline to enter into long-term contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis. There can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products, that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts, or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products. In cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders, we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply. In addition, under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of sole and single source products in the future, we may be unable to supply the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.         36            Our Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture, Which Could Negatively Affect Our Ability to Supply the Market Many of our rapid assay and livestock and poultry diagnostic products are biologics, which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex. Unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy (such as most pharmaceuticals), biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials. Difficulty in characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria. Our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  A Weak Economy Negatively Affects Demand for Our Products and Services  A substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market. Demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of pet visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to diagnostic testing. Economic weakness in our significant markets has caused and could continue to cause pet owners to skip or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or could affect their willingness to treat certain pet health conditions, approve certain diagnostic tests, or continue to own a pet. In addition, concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments. A decline in pet visits to the hospital, and the willingness of pet owners to treat certain health conditions or approve certain tests, in pet ownership, or in the inclination of veterinarians to recommend certain tests or make capital purchases could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services. This, in turn, may cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers, which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided.  Demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at the government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products. Availability of funds also affects demand by the government laboratories and cattle, swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products. Economic weakness in our significant markets has caused and could continue to cause our consumers to reduce their investment in such testing.  Strengthening of the Rate of Exchange for the U.S. Dollar Has a Negative Effect on Our Business  Any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against the Euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar adversely affects our results, as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured in the U.S. and exported to international markets. Approximately 24% and 25% of IDEXX sales were derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local currencies for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, respectively.  Various Government Regulations and Enforcement Activities Could Limit or Delay Our Ability to Market and Sell Our Products  In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including our canine, feline, poultry and livestock tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale in the U.S. Our water testing products must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the U.S. as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA. Our dairy testing products require approval by the FDA. The manufacture and sale of our OPTI® line of human point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by the FDA and these products require approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially in the U.S. The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries. Any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the U.S. or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture or sell our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.         37          In January 2010, we received a letter from the FTC, stating that it was conducting an investigation to determine whether IDEXX or others have engaged in, or are engaging in, unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”), through pricing or marketing policies for companion animal veterinary products and services, including but not limited to exclusive dealing or tying arrangements with distributors or end-users of those products or services. The letter requests that we preserve all materials potentially relevant to this investigation. The letter states that the FTC has not concluded that IDEXX or anyone else has violated Section 5 of the FTC Act.  We received a subpoena from the FTC on April 15, 2010 requesting that we provide the FTC with documents and information relevant to this investigation and we intend to cooperate fully with the FTC in its investigation. We cannot predict how long any investigation might be ongoing.  We believe that our marketing and sales practices for companion animal veterinary products and services do not violate Section 5 of the FTC Act or any other antitrust law. However, it is possible that the FTC could reach a different conclusion at the end of its investigation and elect to commence an enforcement action in an administrative law court within the FTC. If the FTC were to commence an enforcement action we would expect to defend ourselves vigorously. Were the FTC to prevail in the action and through all subsequent appeals, we believe that any remedies likely to be sought by the FTC under Section 5 would not have a material adverse effect on our business.  Our Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Our Proprietary Technologies  We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us.  We cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights. In June 2009, one of the U.S. patents covering our SNAP® FIV/FeLV Combo and SNAP® Feline Triple tests expired. We had licensed this broad patent exclusively from the University of California. Expiration of this patent could result in increased competition in the U.S. market for feline immunodeficiency virus tests and if this competition arises, we expect that revenues and profit margins associated with sales of our SNAP® FIV/FeLV Combo and SNAP® Feline Triple tests will likely decline.  In the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Distributor Purchasing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results  We sell many of our products, including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the U.S., through distributors. Distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the end-user demand for our products. In addition, our agreements with distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days notice. Because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors, the unanticipated loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency, timing or size of distributor purchases, could have a negative effect on our results of operations.  Distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies. Consolidation within distribution channels increases our customer concentration level, which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph. See the section under the heading “Part 1. Item 1 Business – Marketing and Distribution” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.         38          Increased Competition and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results  We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition will become even more intense. The introduction by competitors of new and competitive products and services could result in a decline in sales and/or profitability of our products and services. In addition, competitors may develop products or services that are superior to our products and services, which could cause us to lose existing customers and market share. Some of our competitors and potential competitors, including large diagnostic companies, have substantially greater financial resources than us, and greater experience in manufacturing, marketing, research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do.  Changes in Testing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results  The market for our companion animal and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors. The introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing. Changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect. Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence. In addition, changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing, such as our livestock and poultry, dairy and water products. Declines in testing for any of the reasons described could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Effective January 1, 2009, the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE”) in the European Union was increased from 30 months to 48 months, which has been estimated to reduce the population of cattle tested by approximately 30%. The European Union is considering further increasing the age requirement from 48 months to 60 months, which could be effective as early as January 1, 2011. As a result, we believe that we are likely to continue to lose a portion of our sales of post-mortem tests for BSE.  Consolidation of Veterinary Hospitals Could Negatively Affect Our Business  An increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. is owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners in the U.S. include VCA Antech, Inc., National Veterinary Associates and Banfield, The Pet Hospital, each of which is currently a customer of IDEXX. A similar trend exists in the U.K. and may in the future also develop in other countries. Corporate owners of veterinary hospitals could attempt to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results. Decisions by larger corporate owners to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results. In addition, certain corporate owners, most notably VCA Antech, our primary competitor in the U.S. and Canadian markets for veterinary laboratory diagnostic services, also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals. Any hospitals acquired by these companies generally use their laboratory services almost exclusively and shift a large portion of their testing from in-clinic testing to their reference laboratories. Furthermore, because these companies compete with us in the laboratory services marketplace, hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services, which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline.  Our Inexperience in the Human Point-of-Care Market Could Inhibit Our Success in this Market  Upon acquiring the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc in January 2007, we entered the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market for the first time with the sale of the OPTI® line of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. The human point-of-care medical diagnostics market differs in many respects from the veterinary medical market. Significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more extensive regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, a more segmented customer base, and more rapid technological innovation. Our inexperience in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary medical market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary medical market.         39            Risks Associated with Doing Business Internationally Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results  For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, 25% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales. Possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, inability of our customers to obtain U.S. dollars to pay our invoices, disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, import/export duties and licensing requirements, and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets. Prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period. In addition, many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign currencies are manufactured, sourced, or both, in the U.S. and our costs are incurred in U.S. dollars. We utilize non-speculative forward currency exchange contracts and natural hedges to mitigate foreign currency exposure. However, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our operating profits. Additionally, a strengthening U.S. dollar could negatively impact the ability of customers outside the U.S. to pay for purchases denominated in U.S. dollars.  Our Operations are Vulnerable to Interruption as a Result of Natural Disasters or System Failures  The operation of all of our facilities is vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and man-made disasters, interruptions in power supply, or other system failures. While we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events.  We manufacture many of our significant companion animal products, including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments, many of our Water testing products and certain of our LPD testing products at a single facility in Westbrook, Maine. We also manufacture certain of our LPD testing products in Bern, Switzerland and Montpellier, France. In addition, we maintain major distribution facilities in North America and in the Netherlands, and a major reference laboratory in Memphis, Tennessee. Therefore, interruption of operations at any of these facilities would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  We maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature. However, this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur. In addition, such insurance will not compensate us for the long-term competitive effects of being off the market for the period of any interruption in operations.  The Loss of Our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Could Adversely Affect Our Business  We rely on the management and leadership of Jonathan W. Ayers, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. We do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for Mr. Ayers. The loss of Mr. Ayers could have a material adverse impact on our business.  We Could Be Subject to Class Action Litigation Due to Stock Price Volatility, which, if it Occurs, Could Result in Substantial Costs or Large Judgments Against Us  The market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.         40          If Our Quarterly or Annual Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our Stock Price to Decline, Resulting in Losses to You  Our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing of distributor purchases, product launches, operating expenditures, litigation and claim-related expenditures; changes in competitors’ product offerings; changes in the economy affecting consumer spending; and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall.  Future Operating Results Could Be Negatively Affected by the Resolution of Various Uncertain Tax Positions and by Potential Changes to Tax Incentives  In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination was made. Our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions. If we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives, our inability to use these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings.  Item 2.
