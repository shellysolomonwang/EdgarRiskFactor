Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our 2015 Annual Report for additional information regarding tax impacts.    ﻿   Our foreign currency exchange impacts are comprised of three components: 1) revenues and expenses denominated in a foreign currency; 2) the impact of hedge contracts; and 3) intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary. As of September 30, 2016, based on projected revenues and expenses, excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies, we estimate a 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would reduce operating income for the remainder of 2016 by approximately $3 million. The impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded, as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have on our operating income.       The impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), otherwise referred to herein as a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable prior year period applied to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results normalized for changes in currency in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods.    ﻿   During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately $0.9 million and $11.3 million respectively, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Canadian dollar. Foreign currency hedging gains increased the total company operating income by $0.6 million and diluted earnings per share by less than $0.01 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and increased total company operating income by $1.5 million and diluted earnings per share $0.01 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the same periods of the prior year, foreign currency hedging gains increased total company operating income by $5.0 million and $14.5 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.04 and $0.11, respectively. Net of these lower relative foreign currency hedging gains, changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced total company operating income by $4.5 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.04 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, and reduced total company operating income by $17.8 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.15 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    ﻿       24          At our current currency exchange rate assumptions as compared to actual 2015 exchange rates, we estimate that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to major foreign currencies in which we transact will decrease total company revenue by $14.6 million for the full year ending December 31, 2016. Foreign currency hedging gains are expected to increase total company operating income by $3.5 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.03 in the year ending December 31, 2016, as compared to a total company operating income increase of $20.9 million and a $0.16 increase in diluted earnings per share in the year ended December 31, 2015. Net of these lower relative foreign currency hedging gains, changes in foreign currency exchange rates are expected to reduce total company operating income by $24.4 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.20. The above estimate incorporates actual exchange rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and assumes that the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at $1.08, the British pound at $1.20, the Canadian dollar at $0.75, the Australian dollar at $0.76 and the Japanese yen at ¥106 to the U.S. dollar for the remainder of 2016.       Effects of Economic Conditions. Demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment, including slow economic growth, high unemployment and credit availability. Negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending, resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics. Unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments and diagnostic imaging systems, which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians. Additionally, economic turmoil can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services. In the U.S., we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our CAG customers. Although this data is a limited sample and susceptible to short-term impacts such as weather, which may affect the number of patient visits in a given period, we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful long-term representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the U.S., providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services.   ﻿   Economic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our Water and LPD business customers. Water testing volumes may be susceptible to declines in discretionary testing for existing home and commercial sales and in mandated testing as a result of decreases in home and commercial construction. Testing volumes may also be impacted by severe weather conditions such as drought. In addition, fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and livestock testing programs.        We believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets partially mitigate the potential effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates.    ﻿   Effects of Patent Expiration. Although we have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2015 and are expected to expire during 2016 and 2017, the expiration of these patents or licenses, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or future operations due to a range of factors including our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace; the breadth, quality and integration of our product offerings; our existing customer relationships and our customer support; our sales force; the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products; our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies and/or additional patents; and our significant know-how, scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings. See “Part I. Item 1. Business - Patents and Licenses” of our 2015 Annual Report for more information.   ﻿   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates        The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The critical accounting policies and the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are consistent with those discussed in our 2015 Annual Report in the section under the heading “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”            25          Results of Operations        The following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth, and references in this analysis and discussion to “revenue,” “revenues” or “revenue growth” are references to “organic revenue growth.” Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods for the prior year, net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures. Organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, or as a superior measure to, revenues reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers. We exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control, are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature, size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period, require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction, and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends.   ﻿   Organic revenue growth and the percentage changes in revenue from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions are non-GAAP financial measures. See the subsection above titled “Effects of Certain Factors and Trends on Results of Operations – Currency Impact” for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period.       ﻿   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015        Revenue        Total Company.

These favorable impacts were partly offset by lower consumables volumes from our VetTest ® chemistry instrument due to customer upgrades from our previous generation VetTest to our Catalyst analyzers. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenue also benefited from higher average unit sales prices.    ﻿   IDEXX VetLab service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments.    ﻿   The increase in rapid assay revenue resulted from growth in our SNAP 4Dx® and single analyte SNAP® products. SNAP 4Dx revenue benefited from higher unit sales price, while volume growth moderated reflecting the timing of our marketing programs. Additionally, volume growth in our single analyte SNAP products was partially offset by price declines in our first generation products.        The increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was primarily due to the impact of higher testing volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories, most prominently in the U.S., resulting from increased testing from existing customers, supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies, such as IDEXX SDMA™. Additionally, the increase in revenue was the result of higher average unit sales prices due to price increases.    ﻿   CAG Diagnostics capital instrument placements, including our Sedivue™ Dx urinalysis instrument, which we began shipping in April 2016, drives our highly profitable recurring diagnostics revenue. Our Catalyst One ® analyzer continues to yield strong worldwide chemistry placements, while our Procyte Dx analyzer had strong hematology placements in Europe. The increase in CAG Diagnostics capital instruments revenue resulted from our newly launched SediVue Dx analyzer, which contributed 31 percent to reported and organic instrument revenue growth. This growth was partly offset by lower instrument placements compared to the elevated prior year levels driven by the international launch of Catalyst One, a shift in placements from our Catalyst Dx® analyzer to our lower priced Catalyst One analyzer and the prior year benefit of recognizing previously deferred revenues associated with pre-orders of our Catalyst One analyzer in the U.S. in 2014.   ﻿   The increase in veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue was primarily due to increasing veterinary subscription service revenue and higher support revenue resulting from an increase in our installed base. These favorable factors were partially offset by fewer licensed-based Cornerstone ® placements as we evolve to a subscription-based model for new practice management customer acquisitions.       27       Water. The increase in Water revenue was attributable to all regions in which we operate, most notably from strong performance in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Higher revenues resulted primarily from increased sales volumes of our Colilert ® test products and related accessories used in coliform and E. coli testing.       Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. The decrease in LPD revenue resulted from a decrease in herd health screening in the Asia-Pacific region as well as a decrease in bovine testing, most notably due to the success of certain disease eradication programs in Western Europe, partially offset by growth in China and Brazil.       Other. The decrease in Other revenue was primarily due to lower sales volumes of our OPTI Medical blood gas analyzers and related consumables, partially offset by increased royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property related to our former pharmaceutical product line.    ﻿   Gross Profit        Total Company.

Excluding currency impacts of approximately 90 basis points, gross margins increased moderately, supported by gains in our CAG business.    ﻿   Companion Animal Group. Gross profit for CAG increased primarily due to higher sales volume and a 50 basis point increase in the gross profit percentage for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The gross profit percentage was supported by price increases on our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio and profitability improvements across our worldwide network of laboratories and from higher relative revenue from expanded service offerings. These favorable impacts were partially offset by a reduction of approximately 90 basis points from currency movements, primarily from lower relative hedging gains, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year.    ﻿   Water. Gross profit for Water increased due to higher sales, offset by a 230 basis point reduction in the gross profit percentage. The gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by approximately 200 basis points of currency impact during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year, resulting from lower hedging gains and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.    ﻿   Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. Gross profit for LPD decreased primarily from a 520 basis point reduction in the gross profit percentage during the three-month period, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This reduction was primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, relatively higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable business mix impacts primarily related to lower levels of herd health screening. The overall change in exchange rates resulted in a decrease in the gross profit percentage of approximately 300 basis points, due to lower relative hedging gains during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year.        Other. Gross profit for Other decreased due to lower sales and higher overall OPTI Medical product costs, partly offset by higher OPTI Medical prices and a favorable product mix from higher relative sales of OPTI Medical consumables.   ﻿   Unallocated Amounts. Gross profit for Unallocated Amounts decreased due primarily to higher personnel-related costs.  We estimate certain personnel-related costs and allocate the budgeted expenses to the operating segments. This allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” The increase in personnel-related costs was due primarily to higher than budgeted employee incentives and higher self-insured healthcare costs reported within Unallocated Amounts during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year.   ﻿       28       Operating Expenses and Operating Income        Total Company.

Operating expenses for Other, which totaled $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased $0.8 million, as compared to the same period of the prior year, due primarily to lower amortization expense on intangible assets related to an impairment within our OPTI Medical business during the six months ended June 30, 2016.   ﻿   Unallocated Amounts. Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments decreased $3.6 million to $5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a $8.2 million impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2015, related to internally-developed software not yet placed into service as a result of a strategic shift to refocus our development efforts within our veterinary software and service business. Partially offsetting this reduction were higher personnel-related costs as compared to budget, reflecting increased employee incentives and higher self-insured healthcare costs. This compares to prior period cost control initiatives that resulted in lower than budgeted costs. We estimate certain personnel-related costs and allocate these budgeted expenses to the operating segments. This allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” Additionally, foreign exchange losses on monetary assets increased, due to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the third quarter of 2016.   ﻿   Interest Income and Interest Expense        Interest income was $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $0.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in interest income was due primarily to a larger relative portfolio of marketable securities during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year.        Interest expense was relatively unchanged at $7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year. The mix between our average relative borrowings and interest rates on our unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) and long-term debt, as compared to the same period in the prior year, resulted in no change in interest expense.        Provision for Income Taxes    ﻿   Our effective income tax rate was 30.8 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 31.8 percent for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in our effective rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year, was primarily related to the U.S. R&D tax credit. There was no available R&D tax credit during the period ending September 30, 2015 because the credit had not yet been extended. In December 2015, the R&D tax credit was permanently extended with retroactive application to January 1, 2015. As a result, we fully recognized the related 2015 tax benefit entirely in the fourth quarter of 2015. This favorable factor was offset by a shift in earnings mix in 2016, with relatively higher earnings subject to domestic tax rates as opposed to lower international tax rates, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods due to the impacts of foreign exchange rates and jurisdictional mix changes. Furthermore, beginning on January 1, 2017, our effective tax rate will be impacted by the adoption of new accounting guidance related to the accounting for share-based payments, which we expect will reduce our effective tax rate as a result of recording the related tax benefits through the income statement. These impacts may vary significantly based on the timing of actual share-based payment settlement and the corresponding price per share at the time of settlement.   ﻿   ﻿       30          Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015        Revenue        Total Company.

These favorable impacts were partly offset by lower consumables volumes from our VetTest chemistry instrument due to customer upgrades from our previous generation VetTest to our Catalyst analyzers. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenue also benefited from higher average unit sales prices.    ﻿   IDEXX VetLab service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments.    ﻿   The increase in rapid assay revenue resulted from higher average unit price and sales volumes of SNAP 4Dx and higher sales volumes of single analyte SNAP products. These favorable factors were partly offset by the unfavorable impact of lower average unit sales prices in the U.S. for certain earlier generation rapid assay products.       The increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was due primarily to the impact of higher testing volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories, most prominently in the U.S., resulting from increased testing from existing customers and the net acquisition of new customers, supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies, such as IDEXX SDMA. Also, revenue increased, to a lesser extent, from higher average unit sales prices due to price increases. Testing volumes benefited slightly from favorable weather trends experienced during the first quarter of 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year, and an extra business day in the first quarter of 2016 due to a leap year.    ﻿   The increase in CAG Diagnostics capital instruments revenue resulted from our newly launched SediVue Dx analyzer, which contributed 21 percent to reported and organic instrument revenue growth, and higher ProCyte Dx revenues, partly offset by lower Catalyst revenues resulting from a shift in placements from our Catalyst Dx analyzer to our lower priced Catalyst One analyzer and the prior year benefit of recognizing previously deferred revenues associated with pre-orders of our Catalyst One analyzer in the U.S. in 2014.    ﻿   The increase in veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue was due primarily to increasing diagnostic imaging systems revenue, higher veterinary subscription service revenue, higher support revenue resulting from an increase in our active installed base of diagnostic imaging and practice management systems and higher revenues resulting from an increase in our Pet Health Network Pro® subscriber base. Revenues from diagnostic imaging systems were higher due to the timing of revenue recognized from fewer deferred revenue placements under up-front customer loyalty programs, as compared to the same period in the prior year, and the recognition of previously deferred revenues. These favorable factors were partially offset by fewer licensed-based Cornerstone placements as we evolve to a subscription-based model for new practice management customer acquisitions, as well as lower average unit sale prices on diagnostic imaging system placements.   ﻿   Water. The increase in Water revenue was attributable to all regions in which we operate, most notably from strong performance in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Higher revenues resulted primarily from increased sales volumes and price increases of our Colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and E. coli testing, placements of our Quanti-Tray Sealer PLUS instrument, which we launched in June 2015, several large project orders during the first half of 2016 and to a lesser extent, from higher sales volumes of our products designed to detect cryptosporidium, related to an outbreak in the United Kingdom in the first half of 2016. Testing volumes also benefited slightly from favorable weather trends experienced during the first quarter of 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year.       Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. The increase in LPD organic revenue resulted from strong performance in emerging markets, most notably resulting from higher sales volumes of swine, poultry and bovine pregnancy testing products in various regions and increased sales volumes of our dairy testing products in Brazil. We also benefited from increased herd health screening products and services in Brazil and the Asia-Pacific region. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of bovine testing products within Western Europe in large part due to the success of certain disease eradication programs in the region.    ﻿   Other. The increase in Other revenue was due primarily to royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property related to our former pharmaceutical product line, partially offset by lower sales volumes of our OPTI Medical blood gas analyzers and related consumables.            32          Gross Profit        Total Company.

Excluding currency impacts of approximately 110 basis points, gross margins increased moderately, supported by favorability in our CAG business.         Companion Animal Group. Gross profit for CAG increased due to higher sales and price increases, partially offset by a 20 basis point reduction in the gross profit percentage during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The unfavorable impact of currency during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year, impacted gross profit percentage by approximately 90 basis points, resulting primarily from lower hedging gains. Excluding currency impacts, gross margins increased moderately, supported by price increases for our reference laboratory diagnostic services and IDEXX VetLab consumables and profitability improvements from higher relative revenue of our expanded subscription service offerings, and within our worldwide network of reference laboratories. These favorable factors were partially offset by an increase in IDEXX VetLab product costs and unfavorable product mix from higher relative instrument revenues and lower relative rapid assay revenues.    ﻿   Water. Gross profit for Water increased due to higher sales, offset by a 210 basis point reduction in the gross profit percentage. The gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by approximately 220 basis points of currency impact during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year, resulting from lower hedging gains and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding currency impacts, the gross profit percentage increased slightly due to price increases on our Colilert testing products and related accessories.   ﻿   Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. Gross profit for LPD decreased due to a reduction in the gross profit percentage of 520 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in the gross profit percentage resulted primarily from approximately 390 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to lower relative hedging gains during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year, as well as higher overall product costs. These unfavorable factors were partly offset by the expiration of royalties on certain of our swine testing products and a favorable product mix resulting from higher relative herd health screening revenues.   ﻿   Other. Gross profit for Other increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage of 130 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in the gross profit percentage resulted primarily from higher relative royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property related to our former pharmaceutical product line, partly offset by an increase in overall OPTI Medical product costs.   ﻿   Unallocated Amounts. Gross profit for Unallocated Amounts decreased due primarily to higher personnel-related costs. We estimate certain personnel-related costs and allocate the budgeted expenses to the operating segments. This allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” The increase in personnel-related costs was due primarily to higher self-insured healthcare costs and higher than budgeted employee incentives reported within Unallocated Amounts during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year.   ﻿       33          Operating Expenses and Operating Income    ﻿   Total Company.

The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related costs. The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher external product development and material costs.       Other. Operating expenses for Other, which totaled $8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased $0.8 million, as compared to the same period of the prior year, due primarily to intangible impairments within our OPTI Medical business, partly offset by lower amortization expense on the aforementioned intangible assets and a reduction in personnel-related costs.   ﻿   During the first half of 2016, management reviewed the OPTI Medical product offerings. As a result of this review, we discontinued our product development activities in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market during March 2016 and focused our commercial efforts in this market on supporting our latest generation OPTI CCA-TS2 Blood Gas and Electrolyte Analyzer. Management identified unfavorable trends in our OPTI Medical line of business resulting from this change in strategy. We revised our forecasts downward, causing us to assess the realizability of the related tangible and intangible assets and determined the expected future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the OPTI Medical asset group. Non-cash intangible asset impairments of $2.2 million were recorded within our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   ﻿   Unallocated Amounts. Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased $5.4 million to $9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due primarily to higher personnel-related costs as compared to budget, reflecting increased employee incentives and higher self-insured healthcare costs. This compares to prior period cost control initiatives that resulted in lower than budgeted costs. We estimate certain personnel-related costs and allocate these budgeted expenses to the operating segments. This allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” To a lesser extent, certain foreign exchange losses on monetary assets increased due to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies and certain state tax incentives, which decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Partially offsetting these increases was an $8.2 million impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2015, related to internally-developed software not yet placed into service as a result of a strategic shift to refocus our development efforts within our veterinary software and services business.    ﻿   Interest Income and Interest Expense        Interest income was $2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in interest income was due primarily to a larger relative portfolio of marketable securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year.        Interest expense was $24.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $21.3 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase in interest expense resulted from higher relative interest incurred in 2016 as result of approximately $250 million in senior notes that we issued and sold through private placements during the first half of 2015, for which fixed interest rates range from 1.785 percent to 3.72 percent. Additionally, the increase in interest expense was due to higher relative interest rates on our Credit Facility. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 Annual Report for additional information regarding our senior notes and Credit Facility.   ﻿       35          Provision for Income Taxes        Our effective income tax rate was 30.7 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 30.8 percent for the same period in the prior year. In the rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a tax benefit associated with the U.S. R&D tax credit. There was no available R&D tax credit during the period ending September 30, 2015, because the credit had not yet been extended. In December 2015, the R&D tax credit was permanently extended with retroactive application to January 1, 2015. As a result, we fully recognized the related 2015 tax benefit entirely in the fourth quarter of 2015. This favorable factor was offset by a shift in earnings mix in 2016, with relatively higher earnings subject to domestic tax rates as opposed to lower international tax rates, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.    ﻿   Recent Accounting Pronouncements        We are evaluating the impact that several recent accounting amendments related to share-based payment transactions, leases, and revenue recognition will have on our consolidated financial statements. Other recently issued accounting pronouncements did not have and are not expected to have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item1 of this Form 10-Q.   ﻿   Liquidity and Capital Resources        Liquidity        We fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, proceeds from long-term senior note financings and amounts available under our $850 million Credit Facility. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $391.5 million and $342.6 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Working capital, including our Credit Facility, totaled $67.9 million and negative $35.1 million, respectively, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Additionally, at September 30, 2016, we had remaining borrowing availability of $361 million under our $850 million Credit Facility. We believe that, if necessary, we could obtain additional borrowings at similar rates to our existing borrowings to fund our growth objectives. We further believe that current cash and cash equivalents, our portfolio of short-duration marketable securities, funds generated from operations and committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital purchase requirements, and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months. We believe that these resources, coupled with our ability, as needed, to obtain additional financing on favorable terms will also be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our business as currently conducted.   ﻿   We consider the majority of the operating earnings of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. No provision has been made for the payment of U.S. federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Changes to this position could have adverse tax consequences. A determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable for several reasons, including the complexity of laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we operate, the varying tax treatment of potential repatriation scenarios and the timing of any future repatriation. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries. Our foreign cash and marketable securities are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the U.S.    ﻿   Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 30, 2016, approximately $389.5 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was subject to material repatriation tax effects. We held marketable securities with original maturities of three years or less that had an average AA- credit rating as of September 30, 2016. Of the $241.4 million in marketable securities held as of September 30, 2016, approximately 59 percent of the fair value of our marketable securities consisted of corporate bonds, 13 percent consisted of certificates of deposit, 12 percent consisted of asset backed securities, with the remainder consisting of commercial paper, U.S. government bonds and municipal bonds. Of the $150.1 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of September 30, 2016, 94 percent was held as bank deposits, with the remainder invested in money market funds invested in highly liquid investment-grade and U.S. government and agency fixed-income securities, commercial paper and agency bonds with original maturities of less than ninety days. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 68 percent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries was held in U.S. dollars.   ﻿   Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense and other dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and believe we will continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates.            36       The following table presents additional key information concerning working capital:    ﻿      ﻿                                                                  ﻿        For the Three Months Ended      ﻿        September 30,        June 30,            March 31,            December 31,            September 30,      ﻿          2016 				         2016 				         2016 				         2015 				         2015 				     ﻿                                                                  Days sales outstanding (1)          42.4 				         41.5 				         43.7 				         43.3 				         43.8 				     Inventory turns (2)          1.8 				         1.7 				         1.6 				         1.5 				         1.5 				    (1) Days sales outstanding represents the average of the accounts receivable balances at the beginning and end of each quarter divided by revenue for that quarter, the result of which is then multiplied by 91.25 days.

The total of net income and net non-cash charges, excluding the impact of reclassifying the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements to a financing activity, was $253.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $219.8 million for the same period in 2015, resulting in incremental operating cash flows of $34.1 million driven primarily by higher net income, higher provision for deferred income taxes and increased depreciation and amortization expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These increases were partially offset by an impairment charge of software-in-development in the third quarter of 2015. The total of changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements decreased cash by $19.4 million and $77.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulting in an incremental increase in cash of $57.9 million.    ﻿   The following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements:    ﻿      ﻿                                              ﻿        For the Nine Months Ended September 30,      (dollars in thousands)      2016 				     2015 				       Dollar Change          ﻿                                              Accounts receivable        $  (16,647) 				       $  (51,024) 				       $  34,377 				         Inventories          (2,503) 				         (27,238) 				         24,735 				         Accounts payable          (2,496) 				         (2,841) 				         345 				         Deferred revenue          3,798 				         (2,688) 				         6,486 				         Other assets and liabilities          8,648 				         16,538 				         (7,890) 				         Tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements          (10,225) 				         (10,044) 				         (181) 				         Total change in cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements        $  (19,425) 				       $  (77,297) 				       $  57,872 				            The decrease in cash used by accounts receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from the absence of one-time impacts related to our change in U.S. commercial strategy beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our transition to an all-direct strategy in the U.S., including the establishment of accounts receivable directly with our U.S. end-users that previously purchased from our U.S. distribution partners, resulted in a significant use of cash during the first half of 2015. Cash provided by inventory during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to cash used during the same period in the prior year, was the result of operational initiatives to optimize inventory levels following a period of inventory growth to support new products and increasing demand. Cash used by other assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was the result of higher taxable income as compared to the same period in the prior year. Income tax payments were lower during the first nine months of 2015 resulting from one-time impacts of implementing our U.S. all-direct strategy and the benefit from the Tax Increase Prevention Act enactment late in the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in cash provided by other assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   ﻿       37       We have historically experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vector-borne disease testing, which has historically resulted in significant increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year.   ﻿   Investing Activities. Cash used by investing activities was $76.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $282.4 million for the same period of the prior year. The decrease in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to lower relative net purchases of marketable securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year.       Our total capital expenditure plan for 2016 is estimated to be approximately $80 million, which includes capital investments in manufacturing and reference laboratory equipment, investments in internal use software and information technology infrastructure and the renovation and expansion of our facilities and reference laboratories.   ﻿   Financing Activities. Cash used by financing activities was $141.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to cash used by financing activities of $36.4 million for the same period in 2015. Cash used for financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was due to the absence of a long-term debt issuance in the first half of 2016, as compared to the aggregate issuance of approximately $250 million of senior notes during the same period of the prior year, partly offset by a decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock with higher net repayments under the Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year.   ﻿   Cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock decreased $217.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year. Share repurchases have moderated relative to the same period of the prior year as we have achieved a debt leverage ratio consistent with our long-term target range. From the inception of our share repurchase program in August 1999 to September 30, 2016, we have repurchased 59.3 million shares. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we purchased 1.1 million shares for a cash outflow of $88.2 million, as compared to purchases of 4.3 million shares for a cash outflow of $313.1 million during the same period of the prior year. We believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price. See Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information about our share repurchases.   ﻿   Net borrowing and repayment activity under the Credit Facility resulted in incremental cash used of $78.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year. At September 30, 2016, we had $488.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The general availability of funds under the Credit Facility was further reduced by $1.0 million for a letter of credit that was issued in connection with claims under our workers’ compensation policy. The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations. The obligations under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the failure to pay specified indebtedness, cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness and a change of control default.   ﻿   Since December 2013, we have issued and sold through private placements senior notes having an aggregate principal amount of approximately $600 million pursuant to certain note purchase agreements (collectively, the “Senior Note Agreements”). The Senior Note Agreements contain affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for agreements of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of our subsidiaries, priority indebtedness, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 Annual Report for additional information regarding our senior notes.   ﻿       38          Should we elect to prepay the senior notes, such aggregate prepayment will include the applicable make-whole amount(s), as defined within the applicable Senior Note Agreements. Additionally, in the event of a change in control of the Company or upon the disposition of certain assets of the Company the proceeds of which are not reinvested (as defined in the Senior Note Agreements), we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the Senior Notes. The obligations under the Senior Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the applicable Senior Note Agreement, each of which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the failure to pay specified indebtedness and cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness.   ﻿   The sole financial covenant of our Credit Facility and Senior Note Agreements is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other non-cash charges (“Adjusted EBITDA”) not to exceed 3.5-to-1. At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility and Senior Note Agreements. The following details our consolidated leverage ratio calculation as of September 30, 2016:   ﻿      ﻿                      ﻿        September 30,          Trailing 12 Months Adjusted EBITDA:          2016 				         ﻿                      Net income attributable to stockholders        $  214,025 				         Interest expense          32,220 				         Provision for income taxes          90,431 				         Depreciation and amortization          75,706 				         Share-based compensation expense          20,145 				         Extraordinary and other non-recurring non-cash charges          2,228 				         Adjusted EBITDA        $  434,755 				         ﻿                      ﻿        September 30,          Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio:          2016 				         ﻿                      Line of credit        $  488,000 				         Long-term debt          599,137 				         Total debt          1,087,137 				         Acquisition-related contingent consideration payable          2,021 				         Capitalized leases          711 				         U.S. GAAP change - deferred financing costs          570 				         Gross debt          1,090,439 				         Gross debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio          2.51 				         ﻿                      Cash and cash equivalents          (150,072) 				         Marketable securities          (241,402) 				         Net debt        $  698,965 				         Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio          1.61 				        ﻿   Adjusted EBITDA, gross debt, net debt, gross debt to Adjusted EBITDA and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio are non-GAAP financial measures which should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, financial measures presented according to U.S. GAAP. Management believes that reporting these non-GAAP financial measures provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate our business performance and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility.    ﻿   Other Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees        Significant commitments, contingencies and guarantees at September 30, 2016, are consistent with those discussed in the section under the heading “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 Annual Report.        Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk        For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting IDEXX, see the section under the heading “Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of our 2015 Annual Report. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the market risks described in our 2015 Annual Report.    ﻿       39          Item 4. Controls and Procedures        Disclosure Controls and Procedures        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by the SEC in its Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures at September 30, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.        Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting        There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.        PART II — OTHER INFORMATION        Item 1. Legal Proceedings   ﻿   Due to the nature of our activities, we are at times subject to pending and threatened legal actions that arise out of the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, based in part upon advice of legal counsel, the disposition of any such currently pending matters is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, it is possible that our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more legal actions.   ﻿   Item 1A. Risk Factors        In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our 2015 Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report. The risks described in our 2015 Annual Report are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.   ﻿       40          Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
