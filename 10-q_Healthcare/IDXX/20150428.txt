Item 1A. Risk Factors        In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our 2014 Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The following risk factors (“Strengthening of the Rate of Exchange for the U.S. Dollar Has a Negative Effect on Our Business” and “Increased Competition and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results”) reflect material changes relative to similar discussion within our 2014 Annual Report. Additionally, we have added one risk factor (“Risks Associated with Fluctuations in the Market Values of our Investment Portfolio”) in response to our purchase of marketable securities during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Except as described in this Item 1A., there have been no other material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2014 Annual Report. The risks described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our 2014 Annual Report are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.       Strengthening of the Rate of Exchange for the U.S. Dollar Has a Negative Effect on Our Business        Any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against non-U.S. currencies, and in particular the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and Brazilian real, adversely affects our results, as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars and exported to international markets. A strengthening U.S. dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the U.S. to pay for purchases denominated in U.S. dollars. The accumulated impacts from any continued, longer-term growth in the value of the U.S. dollar against non-U.S. currencies may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.       Approximately 25% and 27% of our consolidated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, was derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local currencies, and during the three months ended March 31, 2015, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2014, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our revenues by approximately $21.3 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against all major non-U.S. currencies in which we conduct business. Additionally, our operating profit and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2015 were reduced by $5.4 million and $0.08 per share, respectively, which are net of offsetting gains of $4.5 million and $0.07 per share, respectively, from our foreign currency hedging activities.            32          Our foreign currency hedging activities (see Note 17 —Derivative Instruments and Hedging in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which are designed to minimize and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, may not sufficiently offset the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates on our financial results over the limited time the hedges are in place. As we primarily use foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months and enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions on a quarterly basis for the current and following year, the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activities to offset longer-term appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar against non-U.S. currencies may be limited. Factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales and other forecasts, volatility of currency markets, and the cost and availability of hedging instruments. Since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.        At our current foreign exchange rate assumptions, we anticipate that this continued strengthening will have a material adverse effect on our operating results by decreasing our revenues, operating profit and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ending December 31, 2015 by approximately $89 million, $18.4 million and $0.27 per share, respectively, net of anticipated offsetting gains from our foreign currency hedging activities of $21.9 million and $0.33 per share to operating profit and diluted earnings per share, respectively.        Increased Competition and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results        We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense. Competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways. New competitors may enter our markets through the development of new technology, the acquisition of rights to use existing technologies or the use of existing technologies when patents protecting such existing technologies expire. New or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services, which could be superior to our products and services. Some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services similar to ours at lower sales prices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive. In addition, our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through co-marketing or other arrangements, which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering. With our transition to an all-direct sales strategy for our kits and consumables in the U.S. effective January 1, 2015, we did not renew our distribution agreements with our former key U.S. distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014, including exclusive distribution agreements with some of the largest U.S. distributors of companion animal veterinary products. We historically sold significant amounts of our kits and consumables through our former U.S. distribution partners, and two of our previously exclusive U.S. distribution partners joined a third former U.S. distribution partner by beginning to carry competitive instruments, consumables and rapid assay products in the fourth quarter of 2014. The promotion and sale of our competitors’ products by our former U.S. distribution partners may adversely affect the retention of our customers for our kits and consumables and the sales and distribution of our products, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Some of our competitors and potential competitors, including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies, also have substantially greater financial resources than us, and greater experience in manufacturing, marketing, research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do.       Risks Associated with Fluctuations in the Market Values of our Investment Portfolio       We invest our surplus cash in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities, including corporate bonds, commercial paper, and a short-term money market fund which invests in securities issued or sponsored by the U.S. government. The value and liquidity of these marketable securities may fluctuate substantially, and could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades of the bonds and other securities included in our portfolio, instability in the global financial markets, declines in the value of collateral underlying the securities included in our portfolio, geopolitical events or other factors. Any adverse changes in the financial markets and resulting declines in the value of our portfolio could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.           33          Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
