Item 1A. Risk Factors        In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our 2013 Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2013 Annual Report, except for the additional risk factor set forth below. The risks described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our 2013 Annual Report are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.       36              Uncertainties in Executing a Newly Announced All-Direct Product Distribution Model in the U.S. Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations, and this New Model May Not Be Successful       On July 25, 2014, we announced our plan to transition to an all-direct product distribution model for our rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables (“kits and consumables”) in the U.S. effective January 1, 2015. Successfully executing this plan will require us to concurrently achieve a number of key objectives in a relatively short period of time, including, among other things, successfully recruiting, retaining and training additional personnel in key positions (such as sales, marketing and customer support) and developing or enhancing the necessary operational, logistics and systems support for an all-direct product distribution model in the U.S. To achieve all of these key objectives and implement the new model will require us to incur additional transitional cost and expense in the remainder of 2014 and early 2015, which will negatively affect our earnings in 2014 and early 2015. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be wholly successful in our efforts, and if we are delayed or otherwise unable to effectively implement and support the new model, our results of operations may be negatively impacted. We also cannot assure you that the new model will result in growth of practice level sales of our kits and consumables from historical levels.       In connection with executing this plan, we are not renewing our existing contracts with our key U.S. distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014. We have historically sold significant amounts of our kits and consumables to our U.S. distribution partners, and this change in our existing relationships may adversely affect the sales and distribution of our products, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
