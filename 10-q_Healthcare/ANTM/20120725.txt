ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The acquisition of a retail contact lenses distributor exposes us to certain risks inherent in the consumer retail market that may adversely affect our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.  Our acquisition of 1-800 CONTACTS, Inc., a direct marketer of contact lenses and eyeglasses through telephone and Internet sites, exposes us to certain new risks inherent in the consumer eye care retail market. We rely on manufacturers of contact lenses, eyeglass frames, prescription eyeglass lenses, and other associated products to supply sufficient quantities for our needs, and to employ best manufacturing practices to avoid product liability claims. Selling prescription medical devices creates numerous regulatory risks due to applicable rules promulgated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission. These regulations include prescription verification rules, labeling and usage instructions and document retention requirements. Business licensing and registration requirements vary from state to state. These requirements are usually interpreted and enforced by state attorneys general. Violations of any of the federal or state regulations and requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties or injunctions. All of these risks could result in regulatory action which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.    -48-    Table of Contents   ITEM 2.
