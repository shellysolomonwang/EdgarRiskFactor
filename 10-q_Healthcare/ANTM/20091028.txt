ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The risks associated with the proposed divestiture of our pharmacy benefit management operations may adversely affect our business and profitability.  On April 13, 2009, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our NextRx subsidiaries to Express Scripts, Inc., or Express Scripts, for $4.675 billion. In connection with the agreement, at closing, we will enter into a 10-year contract for Express Scripts to provide PBM services to our members following the close of the transaction. Risks associated with the proposed divestiture of our NextRx subsidiaries include the following:        •    we may be unable to close the transaction in a timely manner, or at all, because of delays in carving-out the PBM business, failure to obtain regulatory approvals or satisfying other closing requirements, which could result in substantial additional costs or could unfavorably affect the ultimate value of the sale;        •    we may be unable to realize the expected accounting and tax benefits of the transaction, which could unfavorably affect the ultimate value of the sale;        •    the divestiture and provision of transition services may disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and create challenges in maintaining our current customer service levels, business standards, controls and procedures, including complying with federal and state laws and regulations related to the operation of Internet and mail-service pharmacies;        •    we may experience a reduction in the number of customers and related PBM prescription volume;        •    pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies, or other vendors or suppliers may seek to modify or terminate their business relationships with us;        •    a portion of the sale price may be paid in the form of Express Scripts common stock, which will expose us to fluctuations in Express Scripts’s stock price that could unfavorably affect the ultimate value of the sale;        •    Express Scripts’ systems may not interface properly with our systems, which could result in disruptions in operations;        •    as part of the long-term service contract, our members will become highly reliant on Express Scripts’ successful administration of our PBM business; if Express Scripts is unsuccessful, it could materially affect our relationship with our members; and        •    we may be unable to retain the existing employees of our PBM business or attract additional qualified employees to meet current and future needs.    -71-    Table of Contents   ITEM 2.
