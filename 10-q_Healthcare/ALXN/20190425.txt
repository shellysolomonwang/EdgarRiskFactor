Item 1A.Risk Factors.(amounts in millions, except percentages)You should carefully consider the following risk factors before you decide to invest in Alexion securities and our business, because the risks described below may have a material impact on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Risks Related to Our Products and Product CandidatesWe depend on the success of, and revenue from, SOLIRIS and if patients do not switch from Soliris to ULTOMIRIS or ULTOMIRIS does not gain market acceptance, our future operating results may be adversely impacted.Since 2007, our revenue has depended primarily on the sales of Soliris. Unless we are able to develop or acquire new products and technologies, successfully commercialize ULTOMIRIS as described below, and/or materially increase sales of Strensiq and Kanuma (two of our other currently approved products), we will remain dependent on sales of SOLIRIS as a source of our revenue.The commercial success of SOLIRIS and our ability to generate revenue depends on several factors, including: the safety and efficacy of SOLIRIS; coverage or reimbursement by government or third-party payers for SOLIRIS; pricing for SOLIRIS; the analysis by doctors and patients of the cost of SOLIRIS relative to the perceived benefits; manufacturing and uninterrupted supply; the introduction of and success of competing products by competitors (including novel products and biosimilars to SOLIRIS); the size of patient populations and the number of patients diagnosed who may be treated with SOLIRIS; the impact of legal, administrative, regulatory or legislative developments; and our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize SOLIRIS for new indications.While SOLIRIS has been studied for indications beyond PNH, aHUS and gMG (which are the current approved indications of SOLIRIS), there is no guarantee that we can obtain regulatory approval or achieve any commercial sales of SOLIRIS for other indications. Despite positive topline results from the Phase 3 PREVENT study of SOLIRIS in patients with anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) auto antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval to sell SOLIRIS as a treatment for NMOSD due to the failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements. Additionally, even if  we obtain regulatory approval, physicians and patients may not accept SOLIRIS as a treatment for NMOSD or payers may not be willing to pay for or reimburse the costs of SOLIRIS as a therapy for NMOSD.If we are not able to maintain revenues from sales of SOLIRIS, or our SOLIRIS revenues decrease, our operating results would be negatively impacted and our ability to fund research and development programs for the discovery and commercialization or acquisition of new products would be harmed, which would limit our ability to diversify our revenue base and our stock price could be adversely affected.In December 2018, ULTOMIRIS was approved by the FDA for use in the U.S. for adult patients with PNH (and applications for approval of ULTOMIRIS for patients with PNH are under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan and for patients with aHUS in the U.S.).One of our principal business objectives is to facilitate the conversion of PNH patients from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS. While clinical trials demonstrated that ULTOMIRIS is non-inferior to SOLIRIS at an 8 week dosing interval (compared to a 2 week dosing interval for SOLIRIS), existing PNH patients taking SOLIRIS and their physicians may decline to switch to ULTOMIRIS for many reasons including: reluctance to try a new therapy, lack of clinical evidence that ULTOMIRIS is superior to SOLIRIS, no (or limited) reimbursement by government or third-party payers (including as a result of SOLIRIS being available as an alternative therapy), or our inability to manufacture quantities necessary to meet demands.If we achieve our goal of promptly facilitating the conversion of current PNH patients from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS, we anticipate that revenue from SOLIRIS, which accounted for approximately $3,563.0, or 86.3%, of our revenues in 2018, will decline as we move patients to ULTOMIRIS. We have established a price for ULTOMIRIS in the U.S. that, on an annual basis, represents an approximate 10% discount to the cost of current labeled maintenance therapy for SOLIRIS for adult PNH patients of average weight. However, this represents an approximate 10% premium to the cost of SOLIRIS in a patient’s first year of switching due to the loading doses required. We also expect to price ULTOMIRIS for patients with aHUS in the U.S. at a discount to the cost of SOLIRIS for patients with aHUS in the U.S. (if and when we receive regulatory approval of ULTOMIRIS for the treatment of aHUS in the U.S.) and such discount is anticipated to be approximately 30% on an annual basis for an average adult patient maintenance therapy.59We may not obtain marketing approval for ULTOMIRIS as a treatment for PNH in any jurisdictions beyond the U.S. or for any indications beyond PNH.There is no guarantee that the EMA or the MHLW (or any other regulatory authority) will promptly approve the use of ULTOMIRIS in PNH patients or that they will approve the use of ULTOMIRIS in PNH patients at all. We believe that the EU and Japan may be important potential markets for ULTOMIRIS and if we are not able to sell ULTOMIRIS in these geographies, our business may be adversely impacted.Subject to successful completion of clinical trials, we intend to pursue marketing approval for ULTOMIRIS in the U.S., the EU, Japan and other jurisdictions for indications in addition to PNH and, potentially, other delivery mechanisms. The FDA, the EMA or the MHLW could reject our applications for indications beyond PNH (and the EMA and the MHLW could reject our application for ULTOMIRIS for PNH) or for a subcutaneous delivery mechanism for many reasons, including due to a finding of inadequate safety, tolerability, potency or efficacy profiles. Additionally, these and other regulatory agencies may request that we provide additional safety or efficacy data, which may require significant additional time and expense to generate prior to a decision on approval.If ULTOMIRIS is not approved for use in PNH patients in the EU or Japan (or other jurisdictions) or for any other indications or for subcutaneous administration in the U.S., the EU, Japan or elsewhere or if any such approval is delayed, our future business and results of operations may be harmed. In the event of any of the foregoing, while we would continue to sell SOLIRIS in the jurisdictions and for the indications authorized by the appropriate authorities, certain of the patents and regulatory exclusivities related to SOLIRIS expire earlier than patents and regulatory exclusivities we hold on ULTOMIRIS, which may allow competitors to enter those markets at an earlier date utilizing SOLIRIS or biosimilar technology.Our future commercial success depends on gaining regulatory approval for new products and obtaining approvals for existing products for new indications.We have invested, and continue to invest, significant amounts in acquiring new products and technologies and advancing our existing product candidates and technologies. Our long-term success and revenue growth will depend upon the successful identification, acquisition (including licenses from third parties), development and commercialization of new products and technologies, and approval of additional indications for our existing products and products under development. Product development (including products acquired in connection with acquisitions) is very expensive, takes significant time to obtain regulatory approval and involves a high degree of risk. Only a small  number of research and development programs result in the commercialization of a product. The process for obtaining regulatory approval to market a biologic is expensive, often takes many years, and can vary substantially based on the type, complexity, the novelty of the product candidates involved and the indications to be treated. Further, success in early clinical trials, which may lead to further investment in a product candidate by us, may not result in success in later stage trials. In addition, our recent acquisitions have focused on new technologies with which we have very limited experience, including antibody therapeutics targeting the neonatal Fc receptor, which may make the development, approval and commercialization of such potential products challenging.Our ability to maintain or grow revenues may be adversely affected if we are delayed or unable to successfully develop the products in our pipeline, if we are unable to gain approval for SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS for additional indications and in new jurisdictions, obtain marketing approval for STRENSIQ and KANUMA in additional territories, obtain approval for additional delivery systems for our therapies (such as subcutaneous administration) or acquire or license products and technologies from third parties.If we do not obtain regulatory approval of new products or additional indications for existing products or additional delivery systems, or are significantly delayed or limited in doing so, our revenue may be adversely affected, we may experience surplus inventory, we may be required to write down certain assets, our business may be materially harmed and we may need to significantly curtail operations.We develop therapies for rare diseases with limited patient populations that have not been definitively determined, and our success will depend on our ability to identify patients in the disease areas we target.The therapies that we have developed and that are in our product pipeline and in preclinical development target diseases that have a limited number of patients and for which, in many cases, there are either no or limited diagnostics tools. For example, KANUMA and STRENSIQ are currently approved to treat ultra-rare diseases with small patient populations that have not been definitively determined. Our development pipeline programs that may be the basis for future revenue growth also focus on rare (and ultra-rare) diseases for which there are a very limited number of patients. The lack of diagnostic tools, coupled with the fact that there is frequently limited awareness among certain health care providers concerning the rare diseases we treat, often means that a proper diagnosis can, and frequently does, take years to identify (or an appropriate diagnosis may never be made for certain patients). As a result, we may not be able to grow our revenues (even as we introduce new products or as existing products are 60approved for additional indications). There can be no guarantee that any of our programs will be effective at identifying patients, and even if we can identify patients that our therapies can help, the number of patients that our therapies treat may turn out to be lower than we expect, may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products (such as KANUMA and STRENSIQ), or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify, all of which may adversely affect our results of operations and our business. In addition, even in instances where we do add patients, the number may be less than the number of patients that discontinue use of the applicable product in a given period resulting in a net loss of patients and potentially decreased revenue.We may not be able to gain or maintain market acceptance of our products among the medical community, patients or payers, which could prevent us from maintaining profitability or growth.Our products may not gain or maintain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers and others. Although we have received regulatory approval for certain of our products in certain territories, such approvals do not guarantee future revenue. We cannot predict whether physicians, other healthcare providers, government agencies or private insurers will determine or continue to accept that our products are safe and therapeutically effective and that the benefits are meaningful relative to the cost. Nor can we predict whether patients, physicians or payers will continue use of SOLIRIS or elect to convert to ULTOMIRIS in the U.S. (or other jurisdictions if and when approved for use by the appropriate regulatory authorities) or alternative treatments that may become available. Physicians’ willingness to prescribe, and patients’ willingness to accept, our products, depends on many factors, including:•prevalence and severity of adverse side effects in both clinical trials and commercial use;•the timing of the market introduction of competitive drugs and biosimilars;•demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other drugs;•perceived cost-effectiveness and/or evaluations in HTAs;•pricing and availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, including governmental entities;• convenience and ease of administration;•effectiveness of our marketing strategy;•publicity concerning our products and our other product candidates (and those of competitive products); and•availability of alternative treatments. The likelihood of physicians to prescribe SOLIRIS for patients with aHUS (and ULTOMIRIS, if approved for use by aHUS patients) may also depend on how quickly SOLIRIS can be delivered to the hospital or clinic and our distribution methods may not be sufficient to satisfy this need. In addition, we are aware that some healthcare providers have determined not to continue SOLIRIS treatment for some patients with aHUS. While SOLIRIS as a treatment for aHUS is recommended by some regulatory authorities to be used for the duration of a patient’s lifetime, we are aware that some healthcare providers prescribe SOLIRIS for aHUS for a shorter time period and, in some cases, may prescribe SOLIRIS for aHUS in emergency or acute situations only. Decisions such as this by aHUS patients and healthcare providers to use our products for a period that is less than the remaining lifetime of the patient or in only acute circumstances can cause our SOLIRIS revenues, and revenues for our other products, to fluctuate and past sales of our products may not be indicative of future sales for such products.If our products fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance among the medical community or patients in a particular country, we may not be able to market and sell our products successfully in such country, which may limit our ability to generate revenue and could harm our overall business.If our products harm patients, or are perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to our products, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.The testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of biologics for use in humans may cause harm to patients, which exposes us to product liability risks and regulatory penalties.Our products and our product candidates treat patients with rare diseases and, as a result, we generally are able to test our products in only a small number of patients. As more patients use our products, including more children and adolescents, new risks and side effects may be discovered, the rate of known risks or side effects may increase, and risks previously viewed as less significant could be determined to be significant. Previously unknown risks and adverse effects may also be discovered in connection with unapproved uses of our products, which may include administration of our products under acute emergency conditions, such as the Enterohemorrhagic E. coli health crisis in Europe, primarily Germany, which began in May 2011. Under pharmacovigilance guidelines, we are required to timely report any adverse events any patient using our products experiences and any clinical evaluations of outcomes in the post-marketing setting are required to be reported to appropriate regulatory agencies in accordance with relevant regulations, as a result any potential adverse 61events will be promptly brought to the attention of regulators that may likely require prompt remedial action (and any failure to report these adverse events or report such events in a timely manner may result in penalties being imposed by regulators). In the event any new risks or adverse effects discovered as new patients are treated for approved indications, or as our products are studied in or used by patients for other indications, regulatory authorities may delay or revoke their approvals, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials and safety studies, make changes in labeling, reformulate our products or make changes and obtain new approvals for our and our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities. If we experience any of the foregoing actions, it may harm our reputation and, particularly given that we rely on a very limited number of products for our revenue, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. Further, any investigation into the circumstances surrounding an adverse event may be costly and time consuming (even if it is ultimately determined that the adverse event is not the result of the use of our product) or the investigation may not be sufficiently conclusive to prevent a regulatory authority from taking one of the foregoing actions against us.In addition, many patients who use our products are already very ill and may suffer adverse events, including death, during treatment for reasons that may or may not be related to our products. Also, there are risks associated with our products; for example, use of C5 Inhibitors, such as SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS, is associated with an increased risk for certain types of infection, including meningococcal infection. In certain cases, a physician may not have the opportunity to timely vaccinate a patient in the event of an acute emergency episode, such as in a patient presenting with aHUS, which could result in the patient using SOLIRIS or ULTOMIRIS experiencing a life-threatening meningococcal infection (and even in certain cases in which a vaccination can be delivered to the patient, it may not, eliminate all risk of meningococcal infection). Patients using our products and product candidates have died or suffered potentially life-threatening conditions either during or after ending their treatments, and these include patients who have died while participating in a clinical trial (for example, four patients died during the ULTOMIRIS Phase III clinical trial for aHUS, although none of these were considered related to the treatment with ULTOMIRIS). We may be sued by patients who are harmed during the course of using our products, whether as a prescribed therapy, during a clinical trial, during an investigator initiated study, or otherwise. Any such product liability lawsuit or injury claim, which could include class actions, could harm our reputation among patients, physicians, payers and others and require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, and even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our  business, financial condition or results of operations due to the expense of defending any such claim. While we do have product liability insurance, it may not cover all potential types of liabilities or may not cover certain liabilities completely. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms, or at all.We anticipate that we may face increased competition from companies that will enter into the markets we currently serve and as our product pipeline expands into markets that are currently served by other companies.We expect that the business environment in which we operate will become increasingly competitive. Currently, certain of our products are the only approved therapy for the indication they treat. For example, SOLIRIS (in the U.S., EU and Japan) and ULTOMIRIS (in the U.S.) are the only approved treatments of PNH. In the future, we expect that SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS may compete with new, novel drugs and pharmaceuticals currently in development. For example, several companies are developing and engaged in clinical trials for therapies to treat PNH, aHUS, and gMG. If SOLIRIS is approved for treatment of NMOSD, we expect there may be competition in that market as well, as other companies are also operating clinical trials in this disease state. Additionally, other pharmaceutical companies have publicly stated that they are developing and intend to commercialize a SOLIRIS biosimilar. For example, in 2019, a SOLIRIS biosimilar was approved in Russia for the treatment of PNH and aHUS and other SOLIRIS biosimilars may be approved in Russia and other jurisdictions in the future. If a second SOLIRIS biosimilar is approved in Russia, we could effectively be prevented from selling SOLIRIS in Russia. Other biosimilars may be commercially available in other jurisdictions in the future, including the U.S., Europe and Japan. STRENSIQ and KANUMA may also experience competition in the future. We are also aware of companies that have initiated or are planning to initiate studies for diseases that we are also targeting with our product pipeline. Our revenues could be negatively affected if patients or potential patients enroll in our clinical trials or clinical trials of other companies with respect to diseases that we also target with approved therapies.Other pharmaceutical companies have publicly announced intentions to establish or develop rare disease programs and may introduce products that compete with ours (or products that are in our pipeline). These and other companies, many of which have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us, may commercialize products that are cheaper, more effective, safer, have less frequent dosing schedules, or easier to administer than our products. Our current and future competitors may develop products that are more broadly accepted or may receive patent protection that dominates, blocks or adversely affects our product development or business. These 62competitive products, including any biosimilars approved under alternative regulatory pathways, may significantly reduce both the price that we receive for such marketed products and the volume of products that we sell, which may negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Given that a significant portion of our 2018 revenue was attributable to SOLIRIS, one or more competitive novel products or biosimilar could have a significant impact on our entire business. In addition, we experience competition in drug development from universities and other research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies compete with us to attract universities and academic research institutions as drug development partners, including for licensing their proprietary technology. If our competitors successfully enter into such arrangements with academic institutions, we may be precluded from pursuing those unique opportunities and may not be able to find equivalent opportunities elsewhere.If a company announces successful clinical trial results for a product that may be competitive with one of our products or product candidates, receives marketing approval of a competitive product, or gets to the market before we do with a competitive product, our business may be harmed or our stock price may decline.Risks Related to Pricing and ReimbursementSales of our products depend on reimbursement by government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, each of which are subject to pressures to contain costs. If we are unable to obtain, or maintain at anticipated levels, reimbursement for and access to our products, or coverage is reduced, our pricing may be adversely affected or our product sales, results of operations or financial condition could be harmed.Our products are significantly more expensive than traditional drug treatments and almost all patients require governmental payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S. or country specific governmental organizations in foreign countries, and/or private third-party payers to pay all or a portion of the cost of our products. There is also a significant trend in the health care industry by public and private payers to contain or reduce their costs. As a result, payers have in the past (i) decreased the portion of costs they will cover, (ii) ceased providing adequate payment for our products or (iii) not covered our products at all, each of which payers may continue to do in the future (or other payers who have not taken such actions in the past may do so in the future). Any of the foregoing may have an adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations.Our ability to set the price for our products varies significantly from country to country, including in those countries where pricing, coverage, reimbursement or funding of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control. We may be unable to timely or successfully negotiate coverage, pricing and  reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us (or at all), or such coverage, pricing and reimbursement may differ in separate regions in the same country. In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed, which could delay market entry (or, if pricing is not approved, we may be unable to sell at all in a country where we have received regulatory approval for a product). In addition, authorities in some countries impose additional obligations, such as HTAs, which assess how well a pharmaceutical works in relation to its cost. Additionally, U.S. payers are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates. If our products do not meet or surpass these metrics, including any HTAs and other metrics imposed on our products, these payers may not reimburse for use of our products or may reduce the rate of reimbursement for our products and as a result we expect revenue from such product may decrease. We may also, in some cases, elect to reduce prices or reimbursement with third parties which we believe provides value in the long term.Further, certain countries establish pricing and reimbursement amounts by reference to the price of the same or similar products in other countries. Therefore, if coverage or the level of reimbursement is limited in one or more countries, we may be unable to obtain or maintain anticipated pricing or reimbursement in other countries or in new markets. In Canada, for example, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) issued a decision in an administrative pricing matter that we had excessively priced SOLIRIS in a manner inconsistent with the Canadian pricing rules and guidelines and ordered that the price be decreased to no higher than the lowest price in seven comparator countries (we filed an application for judicial review of the PMPRB’s decision in the Federal Court of Canada, and a hearing on the matter was held in November 2018, but we are unable to determine the outcome of this review at this time since the court has not yet issued its opinion). In addition, the current U.S. presidential administration recently unveiled a number of proposals, among these was a recommendation to move from the current U.S. pricing and reimbursement regime to one that would establish pharmaceutical pricing by reference to a target price derived from the international price index (such a change may be expected to result in significant savings for the government for purchases of certain pharmaceuticals). If the U.S., which accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in 2018, were to move to a pricing system based on the international price index (or similar model) that were to apply to our products, we expect that our revenues for sales in the U.S. (or any other country adopting such a price index) may decrease, and such decrease may be material in amount.Due to the cost of our therapies, any potential increase in the number of patients receiving our 63products (for example, we expect there may be increases in sales of SOLIRIS for patients with NMOSD, if approved by regulatory authorities for that indication), may cause third-party payers to modify, limit or eliminate coverage or reimbursement for our products because they may require an allocation of a greater percentage of the potential financial resources of any public or private payer for our products.Further, health insurance programs may utilize coverage incentives and obstacles to discourage beneficiaries from using higher priced products such as ours, including:•establishing formularies under which only selected drugs are covered;•utilizing variable co-payments that make drugs that are not preferred by the payer more expensive for patients; and •utilizing management controls, such as requirements for prior authorization or failure first on another type of treatment.Any of these actions may subject our products to payer-driven restrictions.In countries where patients have access to insurance, their insurance co-payment amounts or other benefit limits may represent a barrier to obtaining or continuing use of our products or adoption of new treatment options, such as ULTOMIRIS. The imposition or continuation of the use of these types of limits or barriers by insurers or the imposition of similar limitations or barriers in the future may have an adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations. In some cases, we have financially supported non-profit organizations that assist patients in accessing treatment for PNH and aHUS, including SOLIRIS, among other therapies. Such organizations assist patients whose insurance coverage imposes prohibitive co-payment amounts or other expensive financial obligations. Such organizations’ ability to provide assistance to patients is dependent on funding from external sources, and we cannot guarantee that such funding will be provided at adequate levels, if at all. We have also provided our products without charge to patients who have no insurance (or limited insurance) coverage for drugs through related charitable purposes. We are not able to predict the financial impact of the support we may provide for these and other charitable purposes; however, substantial support could have a material adverse effect on our profitability in the future. As third-party payers attempt to contain health care costs they are demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they may cover and the amounts that they will pay for drugs. As a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment to patients for our products or they may demand discounts or rebates from us, which may be material. Our commercial success depends on obtaining and maintaining pricing for our products, which is directly tied to reimbursement for our products at anticipated levels for our products. It is difficult to project the impact of evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payers to cover our products, but we expect pharmaceutical pricing to continue to be subject to intense payer, political and societal pressures on a global basis. If we are unable to obtain or maintain coverage for our products, or coverage is reduced or eliminated in one or more countries or if the U.S. (or other countries) were to move to an international price index for our products, our pricing, product sales, results of operations or financial condition could be harmed.Risks Related to Business OperationsWe rely on a limited number of facilities to produce our products and manufacturing issues at our facilities or the facilities of our third party service providers could cause product shortages, stop or delay commercialization of our products, disrupt or delay our clinical trials or regulatory approvals, and adversely affect our business.The majority of our products and product candidates are biologics, which cannot be manufactured synthetically and must be produced from biologic sources. As a result, the production of biologic therapeutics that meet all product specification and regulatory requirements is particularly complex. Even slight deviations at any point in the production process may lead to production failures or recalls. For example, in 2013 and 2014 we undertook a voluntary recall of SOLIRIS due to the presence of visible particles in a limited number of vials. In addition, because the production process involves the use of materials that are derived from biological sources, the process can be affected by contaminants that could impact those biological micro-organisms. Therefore, the manufacture of our products and our product candidates is highly regulated, complex and difficult, and, as noted above, even minor technical problems or deviations could result in significant defects or failures and regulatory action against us. These manufacturing challenges are coupled with the fact that we have limited experience manufacturing commercial quantities of ULTOMIRIS, STRENSIQ and KANUMA (so we may have limited previous experience resolving any issues in connection with the manufacture of these products and it may take significant time to remediate or we may be unable to solve any manufacturing problems) and we rely on a limited number of facilities to manufacture our products for our development, clinical and commercialization needs, some of which we own and some of which are owned by third parties.If we and/or our third party suppliers fail to meet the highly technical requirements of manufacturing our biologic products and our strict quality and control 64specifications, we (or they) may be unable to manufacture or supply our products. We depend on our third party manufacturers to perform effectively on a timely basis and to comply with regulatory requirements and meet our product specifications. If they are unable to do so, our contractual rights to address any failures and right to recover damages are limited. Our failure or the failure of our third-party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our products and product candidates could result in lost revenue, diminish our profitability, delay the development of our product candidates, delay regulatory approval, result in the rejection of our product candidates or result in supply shortages for our patients, which may lead to lawsuits, loss of revenue or could accelerate introduction of competing products to the market.As noted above, the manufacture of our products and product candidates is at high risk of product loss due to contamination, equipment malfunctions, human error or raw material shortages, which may result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or manufacturing facilities, or the facilities of our third party manufacturers, we or our third party manufacturers may need to close our or their manufacturing facilities for an extended period of time to investigate and remediate the contaminant.If we underestimate demand for ULTOMIRIS, SOLIRIS or any of our products, or experience product interruptions at Alexion’s internal manufacturing facilities or a facility of a third party provider, including as a result of risks and uncertainties described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we may not be able to increase our revenues and alternative therapies may gain greater market acceptance.We also face external factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause production interruptions at our facilities or at the facilities of our third party providers, including natural disasters, labor disputes, acts of terrorism or war.The risks to our business of any manufacturing stops or interruptions (whether the result of internal or external factors) are amplified because we rely on a limited number of facilities to produce our products and product candidates. For example, each of our products is manufactured at only one to two facilities. Sales of SOLIRIS, which accounted for 86.3% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, in the U.S., the EU, Japan and certain other territories were manufactured exclusively by Lonza at its facilities in Singapore and Spain. Manufacturing SOLIRIS for commercial sale in certain other territories may only be performed at a single facility in some cases until such time as we have received the required regulatory approval for an additional facility, if ever. We expect that we will continue to rely on a very limited number of  manufacturing facilities in the future for all of our products, including ULTOMIRIS.We and our third party providers are required to maintain compliance with cGMP and other stringent operation and manufacturing requirements and are subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. Governmental authorities will generally not permit products manufactured at a facility that is not registered by the applicable government agency to enter into the country and such products may be returned for failure to comply with such regulation, which may decrease or delay sales and result in the loss of inventory. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection or comply with on-going operating regulations could significantly impair our ability to supply our products and product candidates. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of monetary penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions and damage our reputation.Our efforts to bring more of our manufacturing operations under our control present additional challenges. We have completed the build-out of a fill-finish facility in Ireland to support global drug product manufacture or vial fill finish of SOLIRIS and certain of our other clinical and commercial products. We also completed construction of a facility in Dublin, Ireland in the fourth quarter of 2015, which is comprised of laboratories, packaging and warehousing operations and we intend to make significant further investment in this facility for the manufacture of our products. We are also constructing new biologics manufacturing facilities at both sites. Despite the significant investment we have made in these facilities and operations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely complete the construction of the biologics facilities or the appropriate validation processes or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for these and other facilities, or that we will be able to perform the intended manufacturing and supply chain services at these facilities for commercial or clinical use. Prior to such time, we may continue to rely on third parties for these services.If we experience any manufacturing issues, we may be unable to timely identify alternative manufacturers, and if we are able to timely identify alternative manufacturers, such alternative manufactures may not be able to satisfy our requirements. No guarantee can be made that regulators will approve additional third party providers in a timely manner or at all, or that any third party providers will be able to perform services for sufficient product volumes for any country or territory. Further, due to the nature of the current market for third-party commercial manufacturing, many arrangements 65require substantial penalty payments by the customer for failure to use the manufacturing capacity for which it contracted. The payment of a substantial penalty could harm our financial condition and may restrict our ability to transition to internal manufacturing or manufacturing by other third parties. In addition, the terms and conditions to engage an additional third party manufacturer may not be as favorable to us as our current arrangements and may likely reduce the profit on the sales of any products to which they relate.In addition, KANUMA is a transgenic product and the facilities on which we rely to produce raw material for KANUMA are the only animal facilities in the world that produce the necessary egg whites from transgenic chickens. Natural disasters, disease, such as exotic Newcastle disease or avian influenza, or other catastrophic events could have a significant impact on the supply of unpurified KANUMA, or destroy our animal operations altogether. If our animal operations are disrupted, it may be extremely difficult to set up another animal facility to supply the unpurified KANUMA.Any adverse developments affecting our manufacturing operations or the operations of our third-party providers could result in a product shortage of clinical or commercial requirements, withdrawal of our product candidates or any approved products, shipment delays, lot failures or recalls. We may also have to write-off inventory and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Each of these could have an adverse material impact on our business individually or in the aggregate. Such manufacturing issues could increase our cost of goods, cause us to lose revenue, reduce our profitability or damage our reputation.We rely on a limited number of providers for our raw materials and supply chain services, which could result in our being unable to continue to successfully commercialize our products and our product candidates (if approved) and to advance our clinical pipeline.Certain of the raw materials required in the manufacture and the formulation of our products are derived from biological sources. Such raw materials are difficult to procure and may be subject to contamination or recall. Access to and supply of sufficient quantities of raw materials which meet the technical specifications for the production process is challenging, and often limited to single-source suppliers. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals. The failure of these single-source suppliers to supply adequate quantities of raw materials for the production process in a timely manner may impact our ability to produce sufficient quantities of our products for clinical or commercial requirements. A material shortage, contamination, recall, or restriction on the use of certain  biologically derived substances or any raw material used in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt manufacturing and materially limit our ability to generate revenues.We also depend on a very limited number of third party providers for supply chain services with respect to our clinical and commercial product requirements, including product filling, finishing, packaging and labeling.These third party raw material providers and supply chain service providers operate as independent entities and we do not exercise control over any such third party provider’s operations or their compliance with our internal or external specifications or the rules and regulations of regulatory agencies, including the FDA, competent authorities of the EU Member States, or any other applicable regulations or standards. Any contractual remedies we may have under agreements with these parties may not protect us from the harm suffered by our business or our patients if they fail to provide material or perform services that meet our specifications. Due to the highly specialized nature of the services performed by these third parties, particularly the supply of our raw materials, we do not believe that we could quickly find replacement suppliers or service providers and, even if we were able to identify additional third parties, the terms of any such arrangement may not be favorable to us. In either of these cases, our revenue, results of operations, business and reputation may be harmed and we may not be able to provide the therapies that our patients require.The success of our business may also depend on the security of our products while in the supply chain for delivery to patients, which, as noted above, is dependent on third-party providers. For example, if our products are not fully and adequately secured from unauthorized access by third parties, any of our products may be tampered with or contaminated. If our products were exposed to any tampering or contamination, or if they are not transported in accordance with the required specifications, our patients may be harmed through use of our products, and such harm may be severe. In addition, if the supply chain is not secure (or our distributors do not exercise control over our products while in their possession), we are also at risk for our products to be diverted to patients other than those who are the intended recipient or to patients who do not have a prescription to receive our therapies (or it may be used for treatment by physicians who have not completed the necessary REMs protocols in order to treat patients) or it may be sold by distributors, channels or other entities that are not authorized by Alexion to sell our products. In addition, an unauthorized distributor may not properly store or ship our products, thereby exposing patients to potential harm from use of the product that was not handled in accordance with our standards. If any of the 66foregoing were to happen, we could be subject to costly litigation, significant monetary penalties, harm to our reputation and investigation by regulatory authorities (and potentially subject to regulatory action, including recall, product withdrawals, suspensions and monetary penalties).The sale and use of counterfeit versions of our products could result in significant harm to patients, reduced sales of our products and harm to our reputation.We are aware that counterfeit versions of our products have been sold by entities that are not affiliated with Alexion using product packaging suggesting that the product was manufactured by Alexion. If unauthorized third parties illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, those products may not meet our very stringent product specifications (or the manufacturing, handling and distribution requirements for our products) and any patient that takes any counterfeit product may suffer serious adverse health consequences, including death. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit drugs sold under our brand name and could result in lost sales for us and decreased revenues.If we are unable to establish and maintain effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products.We currently market and sell our products in the U.S., the EU, Japan and several other territories through a direct sales force. Most of our products are relatively new to the market (ULTOMIRIS for the treatment of PNH was approved by the FDA in December 2018, for example), and we have recently hired several senior members of our sales and commercial team. In addition, in order to gain greater efficiencies in our operations, we have begun to implement a plan pursuant to which certain portions of our international commercial operations will transition to a new operating model in which sales and marketing efforts in the designated countries will rely to a greater extent on third-parties to promote and sell our products, and our direct sales presence will decrease in these regions.Due to the fact that many of our products are new to the market, we do not have significant experience in marketing and selling these products to patients, healthcare providers and payers (for example, we are new to certain therapy areas, such as neurology (gMG), and our sales force has had very limited exposure in educating and targeting sales to patients and physicians in neurology practices). This challenge is coupled with the fact that many of our sales and marketing team are new to Alexion and we are transitioning to third parties to market and sell our product in certain countries. If we are unable to successfully market and sell our new products and to successfully sell our products in new therapy areas, as well as successfully implement the  transition to third parties to distribute and market our products in certain countries, our business and sales may be harmed. One of our objectives is to expand our business and sales in the future. If we are unable to establish and/or expand our capabilities to sell, market and distribute our products in those jurisdictions where we will continue to rely on our direct sales force and, at the same time, effectively transition from a direct sales force model (or maintain such distributor capabilities in countries where we have already commenced commercial sales), we may not be able to successfully sell our products. In that event, we may not be able to maintain or increase revenues and achieve our goal of expanding our business. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to establish and maintain our own capabilities or enter into and maintain any marketing or distribution agreements with third-party providers on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to manage the transition to marketers and distributors in the relevant jurisdictions that will not cause any interruption or disruption in our business and sales of our products.Even if we hire the qualified sales and marketing personnel necessary to support our objectives, or enter into marketing and distribution agreements with third parties on acceptable terms, we may not hire such employees or enter into such agreements in an efficient manner or on a timely basis. We may not be able to forecast accurately the size and experience of the sales and marketing force and the scale of distribution capabilities necessary to successfully market and sell our products. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing and distribution capabilities are competitive, expensive and time-consuming. In addition, as we launch new products, such as ULTOMIRIS for the treatment of PNH, and we move into new therapeutic areas (such as neurology), and, if and when, the products we acquire in connection with acquisitions and development agreements with third parties move closer to regulatory approval, we may have a larger product portfolio and address more therapeutic areas and the foregoing risks may continue to apply and may even increase. Our expenses associated with building up and maintaining the sales force and distribution capabilities around the world, and in transitioning from direct sales to third party marketers and distributors, may be disproportionate compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales or any savings or efficiencies we gain through use of such third-parties. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in commercializing any of our products for the above referenced or other reasons.Completion of proof of concept trials, preclinical studies or clinical trials does not guarantee advancement to the next phase of development or regulatory approval or successful commercialization.67Completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials does not guarantee that we will initiate additional studies or trials for our product candidates, if further studies or trials are initiated, what the scope and phase of the trial will be or that they will be completed, or if these further studies or trials are completed, that the design or results may provide a sufficient basis to apply for or receive regulatory approvals or to commercialize products. Results of clinical trials could be inconclusive, requiring additional or repeat trials. Data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials are subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. If the design or results achieved in our clinical trials are insufficient to proceed to further trials or to sustain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we could be materially adversely affected. Failure of a clinical trial to achieve its pre-specified primary endpoint generally increases the likelihood that additional studies or trials may be required if we determine to continue development of the product candidate, reduces the likelihood of timely development of and regulatory approval to market the product candidate, and may decrease the chances for successfully achieving the primary endpoint(s) in scientifically similar indications.We are currently planning and conducting several clinical trials of products and product candidates that we anticipate may be important to our goal of expanding our business and diversifying our product portfolio. These trials may not yield the anticipated results for a number of reasons. For example, the fact that we have obtained marketing authorization in the U.S. for ULTOMIRIS as a treatment for PNH does not mean that ULTOMIRIS will be approved as a treatment for aHUS, gMG and NMOSD or that any clinical trials may achieve its designated endpoints and prove to be safe and effective for use in patients with these indications. In addition, we are also conducting clinical trials in therapeutic areas with which we have limited experience (for example, in 2018 we acquired ALXN1840 (WTX101), a therapy for Wilson’s disease acquired from Wilson Therapeutics and are currently in Phase III clinical trials) and with technology platforms with which we also have limited experience (for example, in 2018 we acquired Syntimmune that develops humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the interaction of FcRn with Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG immune complexes). Each of these clinical trials is subject to the risks highlighted in the preceding paragraph and the investments we have made in these technologies may not generate the expected returns if the clinical trials do not produce results that will meet the requirements of regulators and the needs of patients and their healthcare providers.In addition, we intend to further increase the number of products in our preclinical and early-stage clinical pipeline and the number of indications that our products address. For example, in 2019 we plan to  initiate a proof of concept clinical trial for ULTOMIRIS as a treatment for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and an exploratory clinical study in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS). There is no guarantee that any proof of concept trial or exploratory clinical trial will provide sufficient evidence to advance our research beyond the proof of concept stage or exploratory clinical trial stage, and we may expend significant resources in an effort to establish proof of concept that ULTOMIRIS is a potential therapy for ALS or PPMS or that any other product in development will meet the standard for proof of concept for other indications. In the event that a product does satisfactorily establish proof of concept, and it does advance into preclinical or clinical trials, such product may face the risks and challenges identified in the preceding paragraph.Our clinical studies may be costly and lengthy, and there are many reasons why drug testing could be delayed or terminated.For human trials, patients must be recruited and each product candidate must be tested at various doses and formulations for each clinical indication. In addition, to ensure safety and effectiveness, the effects of drugs often must be studied over a long period of time, especially for the chronic diseases that we are studying. Many of our programs focus on diseases with small patient populations making patient enrollment difficult. Insufficient patient enrollment in our clinical trials could delay or cause us to abandon a product development program. We may decide to abandon development of a product candidate or a study at any time due to unfavorable results or other reasons, including if there are concerns about patient safety. We may have to spend considerable resources repeating clinical trials or conducting additional trials, either of which may increase costs and delay revenue from those product candidates, if any. We may open clinical sites and enroll patients in countries where or for indications in which we have little experience.We rely on a small number of clinical research organizations to carry out our clinical trial related activities, and one contract research organization (CRO) is responsible for many of our studies. We rely on such parties to accurately report their results. Our reliance on CROs may impact our ability to control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials. In addition, we may be responsible for any errors in clinical trials by a CRO as a result of the performance of services in connection with a clinical trial on our behalf. And regulatory agencies, in connection with a potential product or approval or as part of on-going monitoring, will review a CROs compliance with regulatory requirements relating to clinical trials and we may be subject to findings and regulatory action (including denial or delay of product approval) if a CRO fails to comply with regulations.68 Additional factors that can cause delay, impairment or termination of our clinical trials or our product development efforts include:•delay or failure in obtaining institutional review board (IRB) approval or the approval of other reviewing entities to conduct a clinical trial at each site;•delay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;•withdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;•clinical sites and investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;•delay or failure in having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;•long treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness;•lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate;•disruption of operations at the clinical trial sites;•adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients;•failure of patients taking the placebo to continue to participate in our clinical trials;•insufficient clinical trial data to support safety and effectiveness of the product candidates;•lack of effectiveness or safety of the product candidate being tested;•inability to meet required specifications or to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product candidate for development or commercialization activities in a timely and cost-efficient manner; •decisions by regulatory authorities, the IRB, ethics committee, or us, or recommendation by a data safety monitoring board, to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;•failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the product candidate or the approvals for the facilities in which such product candidate is manufactured; and •decisions by competent authorities, IRBs or ethics committees to demand variations in protocols or conduct of clinical trials.We may not accurately forecast demand for our products, including our new products, or the conversion of PNH patients to ULTOMIRIS, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.Our quarterly revenues, expenses and net income (loss) may fluctuate, even significantly, due to certain risks, including those described in these “Risk Factors” as well as the timing of charges and expenses that we may take and acquisitions (such as the Wilson Therapeutics and Syntimmune acquisitions). In the future, we may not generate sufficient revenues or control expenses to achieve our financial goals, including continued profitability. We may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. You should not consider our financial performance, including our revenue growth, in recent periods as indicative of our future performance. Since we have a limited sales and operating history with certain of our products (such as ULTOMIRIS as a treatment for PNH in the US) and for new indications of existing products (such as SOLIRIS as a treatment for gMG), we may not be able to accurately forecast demand for our products. STRENSIQ and KANUMA, also relatively new products, each received marketing approval in 2015, and both products treat rare diseases for which there was no existing therapy in a new therapeutic area. We have recently filed for regulatory approval for SOLIRIS as a treatment for NMOSD. Since approval of ULTOMIRIS as a treatment for PNH in the U.S. in December 2018, we have undertaken efforts to facilitate the conversion of PNH patients in the U.S. from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS. Product demand and, in the case of conversion to ULTOMIRIS, product preference and conversion, is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. For these reasons, we may not be able to accurately forecast demand for our products.We cannot guarantee that we will achieve our financial goals, including our ability to maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.Our investors and investment analysts may have widely varying expectations that may be materially higher or lower than actual revenues and profits and if our revenues and profits are different from these expectations, our stock price may experience significant volatility. Our revenues and profits are also subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations and our results of operations could be adversely affected due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Although we use derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful.In addition, we have in the past provided, and expect to continue to provide, financial guidance for 69future periods and if our actual operating results fail to meet or exceed the guidance that we have previously provided to our investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly.As we attempt to expand our pipeline, obtain regulatory approval for new products, facilitate the conversion of PNH patients from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS in the U.S., seek regulatory approval for existing products in new jurisdictions and approval of new indications for existing products (such as SOLIRIS as a treatment for NMOSD and ULTOMIRIS as a treatment for aHUS), we may have substantial expenses as we continue our research and development efforts, continue to conduct clinical trials and continue to develop and expand manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities worldwide, some of which could be delayed, scaled-back or eliminated to achieve our financial objectives. These expenses may increase and such increases may exceed analyst and investor expectations.If we fail to achieve the expected financial and operating benefits of our corporate restructurings, our business and financial results may be harmed.We have undertaken corporate restructuring activities to re-align our global organization with our re-focused strategy, reduce costs, and realize operational efficiencies. We estimate that our most recent restructuring, which includes our transition in certain jurisdictions from a direct sales model to increased use of third parties, will result in a charge of up to $25.0 in 2019. These recent restructuring activities, including work force reductions, closing certain operational sites and our increased use of third parties in certain countries to market and distribute products (and rely less on a direct sales force), subject us to many risks, including loss of business continuity, unanticipated costs, and higher than usual employee turnover. In addition, we will not exercise the same degree of control over any third parties that we do over our direct sales force and the ability to direct the third party or provide incentives for such third party to sell our products may not be as strong as in the case of a direct sales force. This transition and greater reliance on third party marketers and distributors may also increase the risk of litigation with third parties. The expected cost savings and operational efficiencies from the restructuring activities are based on assumptions and expectations that we believe were reasonable in our judgment at the time made but may not be achieved due to unforeseen difficulties and challenges that are beyond our control. If these assumptions and expectations are incorrect or if we experience delays or unforeseen events in realizing the benefits of the restructuring activities, our business operations and financial results may be harmed.As we implement any restructurings, we must execute on our re-focused strategy, including growing and maximizing our rare disease business and pursuing  disciplined business development to expand our pipeline. If we are unable to effectively execute with fewer human resources and/or attract, retain or motivate key employees, our business may be adversely affected.If we fail to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully develop, manufacture or commercialize our products or products candidates.The success of our business is dependent in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain our senior management, and other highly qualified personnel in our scientific, clinical, manufacturing and commercial organizations. There is intense competition in the biopharmaceutical industry for these types of personnel. In March 2017, our Board appointed a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and we have experienced other recent significant management changes. In addition, since 2017, we have moved our global headquarters and undertaken company-wide restructurings with the goal of re-aligning our global organization with our re-focused strategy and to make our international operations more efficient and effective. The relocation of our headquarters and restructurings have the potential to adversely impact our ability to recruit and/or retain key employees as well as to disrupt our business operations, financial conditions, programs, plans and strategies.Our business is specialized and global and we must attract and retain highly qualified individuals across many geographies. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain the highly qualified personnel necessary to develop, manufacture and commercialize our products and product candidates. If we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts, or if our recruitment efforts take longer than anticipated, our business may be harmed.If we fail to satisfy our debt service obligations or obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we may be unable to commercialize our products or continue or complete our product development.In June 2018, we amended and restated our credit facility to, among other things, increase the amount available under the revolving credit facility from $500.0 to $1,000.0 and extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility to June 7, 2023. As a result, we have significant debt service obligations. In addition to the obligations to make interest and principal payments under the facility throughout the term of the loans, any changes in interest rates related to this debt could significantly increase our annual interest expense and any hedging of this interest may not be effective to control expenses. In addition, we have substantial contingent liabilities, including milestone and royalty obligations under acquisitions and strategic transactions, and we have been, and in the future may again be, engaged in 70disputes with certain counterparties regarding potential milestone and royalty obligations. Our increased indebtedness, including increased interest expense, together with our significant contingent liabilities, could, among other things: •make us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns and competitive pressures; •make it difficult for us to make payments on our credit facilities and require us to use cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, which may reduce the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts, research and development and mergers and acquisitions; •limit our ability to incur additional debt or access the capital markets; and •limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and negative covenants, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, and engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, subject to limited exceptions. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate may increase and the administrative agent may be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. If the interest rate imposed under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement were to increase as a result of a default, our expenses may increase and we may need to allocate additional funds to this interest expense (which may limit the use of these funds for other purposes, including growing our business or responding to changes in our business and industry). If some or all of the amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement were to be accelerated by the lenders, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to pay the amounts due, we may not be able to refinance such debt on terms acceptable to us (or at all) and we may be required to sell certain assets on terms that are unfavorable to us.Our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and meet our debt service obligations and our royalty and milestone obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us or at all.We may need to raise additional capital to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations for working capital, capital expenditure and  debt service requirements, and other business activities. Funding needs may shift and the amount of capital we may need depends on many factors, including, the cost of any acquisition or any new collaborative, licensing or other commercial relationships that we may establish, the time and cost necessary to build our manufacturing facilities or enhance our manufacturing operations, amounts we may need to pay in connection with the resolution of any government investigation or litigation matter (including any securities class action matter or any product liability claim), the cost of obtaining and maintaining the necessary regulatory approvals for our manufacturing facilities, and the progress, timing and scope of our preclinical studies, clinical trials and product development and commercialization efforts. The capital and credit markets have experienced and may continue to experience extreme volatility and disruption. We may not receive additional funding when we need it or funding may only be available on unfavorable terms. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our working capital, capital requirements and debt repayment obligations (or royalty and milestone obligations), we may have to delay, scale-back or eliminate certain research, development, manufacturing, acquisition or commercial activities or sell certain assets and technologies.Our business involves environmental risks and potential exposure to environmental liabilities. As a biopharmaceutical company, our business involves the use of certain hazardous materials in our research, development, manufacturing and other activities. We and our third party providers are subject to various federal, state and local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning the handling and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes, such as medical and biological wastes, and emissions and discharges into the environment, such as air, soils and water sources. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment and a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating its property or locations, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials comply with the laws and regulations established by state, federal and foreign regulations, the risk of loss of, or accidental contamination or injury from, these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for remediation obligations, damages and fines that could exceed our insurance coverage and financial resources. Such obligations and liabilities, which to date have not been material, could have a material impact on our business and financial condition. Additionally, the 71cost of compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations may increase in the future, and we may be required to dedicate more resources, including substantial financial resources, to comply with such laws and regulations or purchase supplemental insurance coverage, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.In order to meet one of our key business objectives of advancing and rebuilding our product pipeline, we plan to expand our business and product offerings through acquisitions of businesses and technologies. Our efforts to identify opportunities or complete transactions that satisfy our strategic criteria may not be successful, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any completed acquisition or other strategic transaction.As noted above, in 2018 a substantial portion of our total revenue was derived from SOLIRIS. We expect that there may be increased competition to SOLIRIS from, among other products and therapies, biosimilars, and we are still in the very early stages of the launch of ULTOMIRIS in the U.S. for PNH and cannot guarantee that our efforts to facilitate the conversion of patients from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS or to have new PNH patients prescribed ULTOMIRIS will be successful (or that we will obtain clearance for ULTOMIRIS for PNH in the EU, Japan and other jurisdictions). As a result, we have identified rebuilding our product pipeline as a key strategic objective and, in order to achieve this objective, we expect to purchase businesses and acquire, co-develop or license technologies and products from third parties in the future. For example, in 2018, among other transactions, we completed acquisitions of Wilson Therapeutics and Syntimmune, Inc. We anticipate that we will regularly evaluate potential merger, acquisition, partnering and in-license opportunities in an effort to expand our pipeline or product offerings, and enhance our research platforms. Acquisitions of new businesses or products and in-licensing of new technologies and products may involve numerous risks, including:•substantial cash expenditures;•potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities and incurrence of debt;•assumption of material liabilities in connection with the target or purchased technology, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify at the time of acquisition;•difficulties in assimilating the operations of the acquired companies;•failure of any acquired businesses or products or in-licensed products or technologies to achieve the scientific, medical, commercial or other results we anticipate;•diverting our management’s attention away from other business opportunities and concerns; •the potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies; and•risks of entering disease areas and indications in which we have limited or no direct experience.A substantial portion of our strategic efforts are focused on opportunities for rare disorders, but the availability of such opportunities is limited. We may not be able to identify opportunities that satisfy our strategic criteria or are acceptable to us or our stockholders. Several companies have publicly announced intentions to establish or develop rare disease programs and we may compete with these companies for the same opportunities. For these and other reasons, we may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates or approved products on terms that we or our stockholders find acceptable, or at all. In such event, we may not be able to rebuild our pipeline and any future revenue may remain largely dependent on our existing products which, as noted above, may be subject to increasing competition from biosimilars and other competitive or novel therapies.Even if we are able to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and other strategic transactions, we may not be able to integrate or take full advantage of them. An acquisition or other strategic transaction may not result in short-term or long-term benefits to us. We may also incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business or an acquired or in-licensed product, particularly if the acquired technology is preclinical trials or early-stage clinical trials.To effectively manage our current and future potential growth, we must continue to effectively enhance and develop our global employee base and our operational and financial processes. Supporting our growth strategy may require significant capital expenditures and management resources, including investments in research, development, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other areas of our operations. The development or expansion of our business, any acquired business or any acquired or in-licensed products may require a substantial capital investment by us and we may likely incur substantial expenses in advancing acquired products to commercialization. We may not have the necessary funds for these capital expenditures and expenses or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. We may also seek to raise funds by incurring additional indebtedness and selling shares of our capital stock, which could dilute current stockholders’ ownership interest in our company, or securities convertible into our capital stock, which could dilute current stockholders’ ownership interest in us upon conversion.We may incur impairment charges in the future for certain of our assets, including goodwill in connection with acquisitions, and such amounts may be material.72If the purchase price of a business acquisition exceeds the value of the assets (and liabilities) acquired, the acquirer must recognize goodwill in such amount. We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets, and such charges may be material and have an adverse impact on our financial results in the period such charges are incurred.As of March 31, 2019, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, net totaled $8,598.2. As required by GAAP, we periodically assess these assets to determine if there are indicators of impairment. We have recorded charges that include inventory write-downs for failed quality specifications or recalls, impairments with respect to investments and acquisitions, fixed assets and long-lived assets, outcomes of litigation and other legal or administrative proceedings, regulatory matters and tax matters, and payments in connection with acquisitions and other business development activities, such as milestone payments. The impairment of tangible and intangible assets may be triggered by developments both within and outside our control. Deteriorating economic conditions, technological changes, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, intensified competition, divestitures, market capitalization declines and other factors may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations in the periods in which an impairment is recognized. As part of our standard quarterly procedures, we reviewed the KANUMA asset as of March 31, 2019 and determined that there were no indicators of impairment. We will continue to review the related valuation and accounting of this asset in future quarters as new information becomes available to us. Cash flow models used in our assessments are based on our limited commercial experience with KANUMA and require the use of significant estimates, which include, but are not limited to, long-range pricing expectations and patient-related assumptions, including patient identification, conversion and retention rates. As we continue to sell this product, new data may cause us to adjust the assumptions in our cash flow models. Changes to assumptions used in our net cash flow projections may result in material impairment charges in subsequent periods. The net book value of the KANUMA intangible asset as of March 31, 2019 is $3,187.6.Our business could be adversely affected by litigation, government investigations and enforcement actions.We operate in many jurisdictions in a highly regulated industry and we could be subject to litigation, government investigation and enforcement actions on a variety of matters in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions,  including, without limitation, intellectual property, regulatory, product liability, environmental, whistleblower, Qui Tam, false claims, privacy, anti-kickback, anti-bribery, securities, commercial, employment and other claims and legal proceedings which may arise from conducting our business. See Note 18, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information on our material legal proceedings. For example, in May 2015, we received a subpoena in connection with an investigation by the Enforcement Division of the SEC requesting information related to our grant-making activities and compliance with the FCPA in various countries. In addition, in October 2015, we received a request from the DOJ for the voluntary production of documents and other information pertaining to Alexion’s compliance with FCPA. The SEC and DOJ also seek information related to Alexion’s recalls of specific lots of Soliris and related securities disclosures. Alexion is cooperating with these investigations. The investigations have focused on operations in various countries, including Brazil, Colombia, Japan, Russia and Turkey, and Alexion's compliance with the FCPA and other applicable laws. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations, by the SEC or DOJ in the above referenced matter for example, could result in the imposition of fines, civil and criminal penalties, equitable remedies, including disgorgement, injunctive relief, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs, healthcare debarment, product recalls, reputational damage and modifications of our business practices and/or other sanctions against us, and remediation of any such findings could have an adverse effect on our business operations. In addition, we may be required to expend significant resources to defend the securities class action filed in December 2016 and, if we were found to have violated the securities laws, we could be required to pay significant damages to the plaintiffs. Legal proceedings, government investigations, including the SEC and DOJ investigations, and enforcement actions have been and we expect may continue to be expensive and time consuming. Any future litigation or investigation may also likely be expensive and time consuming.The efficiency of our corporate structure depends on the application of the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities or our effective tax rate could increase, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.As a company with international operations, we are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable at the time made, the final 73taxes we owe may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements (and such differences may be material). If the IRS, or other taxing authority, disagrees with the positions we take, we could have additional tax liability, and this could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations, changes in interpretations of tax laws, including pending tax law changes, changes in our manufacturing activities and changes in our future levels of research and development spending.We have designed, and from time to time we modify, our corporate structure, the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property, and our intercompany transactions between our affiliates in a way that is intended to enhance our operational and financial efficiency and increase our overall profitability. The application of the tax laws and regulations of various countries in which we operate and to our global operations is subject to interpretation. We also must operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure to realize such efficiencies. The tax authorities of the countries in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or for transfer pricing or other operations. If tax authorities determine that the manner in which we operate results in our business not achieving the intended tax consequences, our effective tax rate could increase (and such increase may be material) and harm our financial position and results of operations. In addition, certain governments are considering and may adopt tax reform measures that significantly increase our worldwide tax liabilities. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and other government bodies have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations, including, in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” where payments are made from affiliates in jurisdictions with high tax rates to affiliates in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. It is possible that these reform measures could increase our effective tax rate (and such increase may be material) and harm our financial position and results of operations over the next several years.Our sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks relating to the conduct of our international business.We have increased our international presence, including in emerging markets. Our operations in foreign countries subject us to a variety of risks, including:•difficulties or the inability to obtain necessary foreign regulatory or reimbursement approvals of our products in a timely manner or at all;•political or economic determinations that adversely impact pricing or reimbursement policies; •economic problems or political instability;•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•difficulties or inability to obtain financing in markets;•unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;•customs and tax officials in foreign jurisdictions may disagree with the value we set when we or others import our products (including products that are donated for charitable purposes) and we may be required to pay additional duties or fines and such amounts may be substantial;•difficulties in establishing and enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;•compliance with complex import and export control laws;•trade restrictions and restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities;•compliance with tax, employment and labor laws;•costs and difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified managers and employees to manage and operate the business in local jurisdictions;•costs and difficulties in managing and monitoring international operations; and•longer payment cycles.Additionally, our business and marketing methods are subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, which may differ significantly from country to country and may conflict with U.S. laws and regulations. The FCPA and anti-bribery laws and regulations in the locations in which we operate our business are extensive and far-reaching, and we must maintain accurate records and control over the activities of our distributors and third party service providers in countries where we operate. We have policies and procedures, and we are currently implementing an enhanced company-wide compliance program and effort, designed to help ensure that we and our representatives, including our employees and our vendors and distributors, comply with such laws, however we cannot guarantee that these policies and procedures will protect us against liability under the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws for actions taken by us or our representatives. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations, including the FCPA and the UK Anti-Bribery Act, could result in the imposition of fines, civil and criminal penalties, equitable remedies, including disgorgement, injunctive relief, and/or other sanctions against us, and remediation of such findings could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. In addition, as our international operations expand, we are likely to become subject to 74new anti-corruption/anti-bribery laws or existing laws may govern our activities in new jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, as we move from a direct sales force to third-party distributors and marketers in certain countries and regions, we may also have liability under the FCPA and anti-bribery laws and regulations for their actions. Although we can impose contractual restrictions on what they are authorized to do on our behalf, we will exercise only limited control over the actions of these third parties but may still face the same liabilities for their actions. Our failure, and the failure of others who we engage to act on our behalf, to comply, with the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, or will operate in the future, could materially harm our business.Currency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates could adversely affect our revenue, increase our costs and negatively affect our profitability.We conduct a substantial portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and such fluctuations affect our operating results. The exposures result from portions of our revenues, as well as the related receivables, and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian dollar and Turkish Lira. As the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currencies decrease. When the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative value of such sales increase. We manage a portion of our foreign currency transaction risk within specified guidelines through the use of derivatives. All of our derivative instruments are utilized for risk management purposes, and we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures resulting from portions of our forecasted revenues, including intercompany revenues that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The purpose of the revenue hedges is to reduce the volatility of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results and to increase the visibility of the foreign exchange impact on forecasted revenues. Further, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts, with durations of approximately 8 months, designed to limit the balance sheet exposure of monetary assets and liabilities. We enter into these hedges to reduce the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on our operating results. Gains and losses on these hedge transactions are designed to offset gains and losses on underlying balance sheet exposures. While we attempt to hedge certain currency risks, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which we do business have, in the past, caused foreign currency transaction gains and losses and have also impacted the amounts of revenues and expenses calculated in U.S. dollars and will do so in the  future. Likewise, past currency fluctuations have at times resulted in foreign currency transaction gains, and there can be no assurance that these gains can be reproduced. Any significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to the Regulatory EnvironmentWe operate in a highly regulated industry and if we or our third party providers fail to comply with U.S. and foreign regulations, we or our third party providers could lose our approvals to market our products or our product candidates, and our business may be seriously harmed.We and our current and future third party vendors, contract manufacturers, CROs, distributors and suppliers and logistic providers are subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by governmental authorities around the world, including the FDA, EMA, the competent authorities of the EU Member States and the MHLW. These regulations, many of which are complex, relate to almost all aspects of our business, including GCP, GLP, cGMP and pharmacovigilance rules (for additional information on the regulations relating to our business, see “Business - Government Regulation” in Item 1 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018). If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured (such as product contamination), or in the case of KANUMA, problems with animal operations, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us. We have received a Warning Letter from the FDA relating to compliance with FDA’s cGMP requirements at one of our facilities, which was remediated. If we had failed to address the FDA’s concerns or if we (or one of our third party contract manufacturers) were to receive another Warning Letter in the future relating to cGMP or other applicable regulations, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could take regulatory action, including fines, civil penalties, recalls, seizure of product, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of clinical trials, withdrawal of FDA approval and/or criminal prosecution.If we or our third-party providers, including our product fill-finish providers, packagers and labelers, fail to comply fully with applicable regulations, then we may be required to initiate a recall or withdrawal of our products. In addition to our manufacturing operations and those of contract manufacturers’ manufacturing operations being subject to inspection and potential regulatory action for failure to comply with (among other regulations) cGMP, our animal operations may also be subject to FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) inspection to evaluate whether our animal husbandry, containment, personnel, and record keeping 75practices are sufficient to ensure safety and security of our transgenic chickens and animal products (e.g., eggs, waste, etc.). Any failure to ensure safety and security of our transgenic chickens and/or animal products could result in regulatory action by the FDA or another regulatory body, including USDA APHIS.Failure to comply with the laws and requirements, including statutes and regulations, administered by the FDA, the EC, the competent authorities of the EU Member States, the MHLW or other agencies, could result in:•a product recall;•a product withdrawal;•significant administrative and judicial sanctions, including, warning letters or untitled letters;•significant fines and other civil penalties;•suspension, variation or withdrawal of a previously granted approval for our products;•interruption of production;•operating restrictions, such as a shutdown of production facilities or production lines, or new manufacturing requirements;•suspension or termination of ongoing clinical trials;•delays in approving or refusal to approve our products including pending BLAs or BLA supplements for our products or a facility that manufactures our products;•seizing or detaining product;•requiring us or our partners to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance; •injunctions; and/or•criminal prosecution.In addition, we are subject to antitrust regulations with respect to our acquisitions, as well as our interactions with other participants in the markets we serve. In addition, these antitrust laws are vigorously enforced in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions in which we operate. In connection with any business development transaction, acquisition, development agreement or collaboration that is reviewed by regulatory authorities, there can be no assurance that these antitrust approvals will be obtained. In addition, the governmental entities from which these approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of such business development transaction or require changes to the terms of the applicable transaction. In addition, the regulatory review process may cause a  delay in the closing of a transaction beyond the time that we anticipate and communicate. Any conditions or unexpected delays in approval could have the effect of jeopardizing or delaying completion of the applicable transaction or reducing the anticipated benefits of the transaction (or, as noted above, may prohibit closing of the transaction).Our product candidates require extensive clinical testing and regulatory approval and failure to satisfy regulatory requirements that meet the appropriate safety and efficacy thresholds may prevent us from being able to market our products and limit our ability to grow our business and diversify our revenue.We believe our future success may depend on our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates and, to this end, we have recently acquired companies and technologies in an effort to expand our product pipeline. Our product candidates are in various stages of development and must satisfy the rigid safety and efficacy requirements of the FDA and other foreign regulatory agencies before they can be approved for sale to patients. To satisfy these standards, we must ensure, among other things, that we have appropriately established our protocol designs, obtained the necessary IRB approval, provide adequate patient enrollment rates, timely and appropriately report any adverse events and serious adverse events to the appropriate authorities and ensure compliance with cGCP. If we or our third-party clinical trial providers or third-party CROs do not successfully carry out these clinical activities, our clinical trials or the potential regulatory approval of a product candidate may be delayed or be unsuccessful.If we discover safety or safety reporting issues with any of our approved products, or if we fail to comply with continuing U.S. and applicable foreign regulations, our revenue may decrease, an approved product could lose its marketing approval or sales could be suspended and our business could be materially harmed.Following marketing approval of a pharmaceutical product, the safety profile of such product continues to be closely monitored by the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities. Regulations continue to apply after product approval, and cover, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality control, finishing, filling, labeling, advertising, promotion, risk mitigation, adverse event reporting requirements and export of biologics. For example, the REMS program for SOLIRIS, most recently updated by the FDA in 2015, requires prescribing information regarding the level of fever needed to seek medical attention and reporting adverse events. Future changes to the SOLIRIS REMS (or similar requirements for other products) could be costly and burdensome to implement. We are required to report any serious and unexpected adverse experiences and certain quality 76problems with our products to the FDA, the EMA, the MHLW and other health agencies. Adverse safety events involving our products may have a negative impact on our business. Discovery of safety issues with our products could result in product liability claims and could cause additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling or safety monitoring, withdrawal of products from the market and the imposition of fines or criminal penalties. In addition, governmental authorities are making greater amounts of safety information directly available to the public through periodic safety update reports, patient registries and other reporting requirements. The reporting of adverse safety events may also damage physician, patient and/or investor confidence in our products and our reputation. Any adverse events in connection with the use of our products could result in liabilities, loss of revenues, material write-offs of inventory, material impairments of intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets, material restructuring charges and other adverse impacts on our results of operations.Regulatory agencies periodically inspect our pharmacovigilance processes. If these regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties whom we do not control that perform services on our behalf, including clinical trial investigators, have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including monetary fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties.As a condition of approval for marketing our products, governmental authorities may require us to conduct additional studies. In connection with the approval of SOLIRIS in the U.S., EU and Japan, for the treatment of PNH, we agreed to establish a PNH Registry, monitor immunogenicity, monitor compliance with vaccination requirements, and determine the effects of anticoagulant withdrawal among PNH patients receiving eculizumab, and, specifically in Japan, we agreed to conduct a trial in a limited number of Japanese PNH patients to evaluate the safety of a meningococcal vaccine. In connection with the approval of SOLIRIS in the U.S. for the treatment of aHUS, we agreed to establish an aHUS Registry and complete additional human clinical studies in adult and pediatric patients. Furthermore, in connection with the approval of STRENSIQ in the U.S., we agreed to conduct a prospective observational study in treated patients to assess the long-term safety of STRENSIQ therapy and to develop complementary assays. Similarly, in connection with the approval of KANUMA in the U.S., we agreed to conduct a long-term observational study of treated patients, either as a standalone study or as a component of the existing LAL Registry. In the EU, in connection with the grant of authorization for STRENSIQ, we agreed to conduct a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 2a study of STRENSIQ in patients with HPP  and to extend the studies ENB-008-10 and ENB-009-10 to provide efficacy data in patients 13 to 18 years of age, which we have commenced.In the U.S., the FDA can also propose to withdraw approval for a product if it determines that such additional studies are inadequate or if new clinical data or information shows that a product is not safe for use in an approved indication.In addition, similar or more stringent post-approval requirements and obligations may be imposed by the FDA and/or other regulatory agencies with respect to our future products (such as ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS for the treatment of NMOSD, if approved for use by the FDA and such agencies). Compliance with these post-approval requirements could result in increased cost and expense and decrease our operating margins and, if we are unable to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to regulatory action by the applicable regulatory agency and the penalties may include fines and product withdrawals or restrictions in the use of a product.If we fail to comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, including those related to healthcare fraud and abuse, we may be subject to investigations and civil or criminal penalties and our business could be adversely affected.We are subject to healthcare “fraud and abuse” laws, such as the False Claims Act, the anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, laws prohibiting off-label product promotion and other related federal and state laws and regulations.The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind to induce, or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. Liability may be established without a person or entity having actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it. A conviction for violation of the Anti-kickback Statute requires mandatory exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The majority of states also have statutes similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and false claims laws that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.The FCA prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. Pharmaceutical companies have been 77investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the Federal government under the FCA for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe products; engaging in promotion of pharmaceuticals for uses that the FDA has not approved, or “off-label” uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program.We seek to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute and FCA laws, including operating within any available safe harbors, but we cannot assure that our compliance program, policies and procedures will always protect us from acts committed by its employees or third-party distributors or service providers.Other related federal and state laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, among others, the federal False Statements Statute, the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, HIPAA, the federal Open Payments program, state anti-kickback and false claims acts, and state and local disclosure requirements and marketing restrictions. Additional information about the scope of these requirements and potential penalties is provided under “Government Regulation - Fraud and Abuse” included above in Item 1 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.In recent years, legislation has been adopted at the federal, state and local level requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, health care provider payments and other activities. For example, as part of the PPACA, the federal government enacted the Open Payments (commonly known as the Sunshine Act) provisions. Open Payments requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to CMS payments or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. We also now have similar reporting obligations throughout the EU. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements may result in significant civil monetary penalties.Violations of U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws (and comparable laws in foreign jurisdictions) may result in criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, including fines, damages, civil monetary penalties (which may be material in amount) and exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Any action initiated against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could materially adversely  affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.Finally, the FDA, the EU and EU Member States and the MHLW impose restrictions on the promotion and marketing of drug products and prohibit pharmaceutical manufacturers from promoting products for indications other than those cleared or approved by regulatory authorities or for use in manner that is not consistent with the product label approved by regulatory agencies, or off-label promotion. In certain instances, physicians are, however, in their medical judgment permitted to use products for unapproved purposes and we are aware of such uses of SOLIRIS. For information regarding a recent MHLW inquiry focused on our communication efforts regarding the proper use of SOLIRIS in Japan for aHUS, see Note 18, “Commitments and Contingencies” to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Although we believe our marketing materials and training programs for physicians do not constitute improper promotion, the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), other federal or state government agencies, the EU, EU Member States or the MHLW may disagree. If any governmental authority determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities constitute improper promotion of any of our products, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, product withdrawal or recall, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds.The sales and marketing practices of the pharmaceutical industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from authorities such as the DOJ, and we expect that this trend may continue and may increase. If the government or the courts determine that we breached any of these sales and marketing laws, we may be subject to penalties identified above. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, also could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, harm our reputation and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.Our business and operations may be materially adversely affected by government investigations.We are subject to the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and/or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or 78retaining business and we operate in countries that are recognized as having a greater potential for governmental and commercial corruption. While we have, and continue to, enhance our compliance and training programs, we cannot assure that our compliance program, policies and procedures will always protect us from acts committed by employees or third-parties acting on our behalf.In May 2015, we received a subpoena in connection with an investigation by the Enforcement Division of the SEC requesting information related to our grant-making activities and compliance with the FCPA in various countries. In addition, in October 2015, we received a request from the DOJ for the voluntary production of documents and other information pertaining to our compliance with the FCPA. The SEC and DOJ also sought information related to our recalls of specific lots of SOLIRIS and related securities disclosures. In December 2016, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts requesting documents relating generally to our support of certain 501(c)(3) organizations (as described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). We settled this investigation with the DOJ and the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in April 2019 which resulted in a payment to the government of $13.1 million. In May 2017, Brazilian authorities seized records and data from our Sao Paulo, Brazil offices as part of an investigation being conducted into our Brazilian operations. In October 2018, the MHLW conducted an inspection of our Japanese operations and in March 2019, the MHLW indicated that its investigation is complete. We are cooperating with the open investigations. At this time, we are unable to predict the duration, scope or outcome of the open investigations. In addition, even though we have settled the investigation relating generally to our support of certain 501(c)(3) organizations that was initiated by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts in December 2016 and the October 2018 investigation by the MHLW has been closed by the MHLW, we may be subject to similar investigations in the future by the same or other regulatory agencies and government authorities and the penalties imposed on us may be materially greater in amount or we may be subject to material limitations on our operations, activities and our business. Any determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with existing U.S. or foreign laws or regulations, could result in the imposition of a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions against us and certain of our directors, officers and/or employees, including injunctive relief, disgorgement, substantial fines or penalties, imprisonment, and other legal or equitable sanctions, including exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other governmental healthcare programs. Any attempts to resolve some or all of these  matters may not be successful. If we were to engage in settlement discussions with respect to any current or future investigation or litigation (and we may accrue amounts due to the nature of such discussions), but the matter is not settled, the ultimate resolution may result in monetary or other penalties materially stricter or greater than the terms or amounts that we proposed in discussions (or the amount that we accrued for such matter during negotiations). Additionally, remediation of any such findings resulting from these and any future investigations could have an adverse effect on our business operations, and we could experience interruptions of business, harm to our reputation, debarment from government contracts, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, and necessary licenses and permits could be terminated. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. Cooperating with and responding to requests for information in connection with these ongoing investigations, as well as responding to any future U.S., state or foreign governmental investigation or whistleblower lawsuit, has resulted and could continue to result in substantial expenses, and could divert management’s attention from other business concerns and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and growth prospects.Changes in healthcare laws and implementing regulations, as well as changes in healthcare policy, may affect coverage and reimbursement of our products in ways that we cannot currently predict and these changes could adversely affect our business and financial condition. In the U.S., there have been a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives focused on containing the cost of healthcare. The PPACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the U.S., and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The PPACA contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations, in some cases in ways we cannot currently predict. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, rules regarding prescription drug benefits under health insurance exchanges, expansion of the 340B program, expansion of state Medicaid programs, fraud and abuse enforcement and rules governing the approval of biosimilar products (and allowing biosimilars access to the market in accordance with the FDA’s Biosimilars Action Plan). These changes may impact existing government healthcare programs and may result in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. In 2016, CMS implemented changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the PPACA. 79Moreover, in the future, Congress could enact legislation that further increases Medicaid drug rebates or other costs and charges associated with participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The issuance of regulations and coverage expansion by various governmental agencies relating to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program has and may continue to increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, has been and may be time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Similar efforts to those in the United States, and in some cases even more aggressive efforts, are being taken by governments to control the costs of pharmaceutical drugs in countries outside the U.S. In these markets outside the U.S., the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products is subject to direct or indirect governmental control and such government authorities are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of drug products and due to their control over pricing are able to move quickly to implement pricing changes.We may face uncertainties as a result of federal and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. There is no assurance that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform may affect our business.The current presidential administration has also indicated an intent to address prescription drug pricing and recent Congressional hearings have brought increased public attention to the costs of prescription drugs. These actions and the uncertainty about the future of the PPACA and healthcare laws may put downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.State governments have sought to put in place limits and caps on pharmaceutical prices and have also requested rebates for certain pharmaceuticals. Attempts to decrease prices of pharmaceuticals products may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs which could lead to managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for beneficiaries and a corresponding limitation on prices and reimbursement for our products.Governments in countries where we operate have adopted or have also shown significant interest in pursuing legislative initiatives to reduce costs of healthcare. We expect that the implementation of current laws and policies, the amendment of those laws and policies in the future, as well as the adoption of new laws and policies, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase our product sales or successfully  commercialize our product candidates, or could limit or eliminate our future spending on development projects. The announcement or adoption of regulatory or legislative proposals could delay or prevent our entry into new markets, affect our reimbursement or sales in the markets where we are already selling our products and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, Medicare, or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.We participate in and have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and we have obligations to report the average sales price under the Medicare program. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for quantities of our products that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our products under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. Any failure to comply with these price reporting and rebate payment obligations could negatively impact our financial results.Pricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations, including those in connection with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and 340B drug pricing program (as described further below) are complex and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by CMS or other applicable government authorities to be incomplete or incorrect. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. For example, if we become aware that our reporting to CMS for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed twelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due, and CMS may request or require restatements for earlier periods as well. Such restatements and recalculations increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing these programs, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at 80which we are required to offer our products to certain covered entities under the 340B pricing program.We are liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, civil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false pricing information to the government, if we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our average sales price, or if we fail to submit the required pricing data on a timely basis. Such conduct also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs. If a governmental authority, such as CMS, were to take any of the foregoing actions, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted.The Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program, and other comparable government and payer regulations, may have a negative impact on the price we can charge for our products and result in a decrease in revenues.Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The 340B pricing program is described in Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement in Item 1 Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on, among other prices, the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. We are a participant in the 340B drug pricing program and are, for the applicable covered entities, subject to the price ceiling. Any changes to the 340B drug pricing program, including:•the method of calculating the 340B ceiling price for our products (such as the pricing regulations that have been further delayed until July 2019);•any expansion of the entities that qualify as covered entities; and •any requirement that participating manufacturers agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient settings; could have a material and negative impact our revenue and results of operations.In addition, the agreement that manufacturers must sign to participate in the 340B pricing program obligates a manufacturer to offer the 340B price to covered entities if the manufacturer makes the drug available to any other purchaser at any price and to report to the government the ceiling prices for its drugs.Beyond the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program, federal law requires that a company must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule (FFS) pricing program to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds. If we overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or Section 703 Agreement, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we are required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the FCA and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, may be expensive, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.We may be subject to numerous and varying privacy and security laws, and our failure to comply could result in penalties and reputational damage.We are subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of personal information including health information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. Each of these laws is subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to penalties or sanctions, including criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.Numerous other countries have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information as well. EU Member States and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the EC adopted the EU Data Protection Directive, as implemented into national laws by the EU Member States, which imposes strict 81obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. Data protection authorities from different EU Member States have interpreted the privacy laws differently, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU, and guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. Any failure to comply with the rules arising from the EU Data Protection Directive and related national laws of EU Member States could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our operating results.In May 2016, the EU formally adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which applies in all EU Member States and went into effect on May 25, 2018 and replaced the EU Data Protection Directive on that date. The regulation introduces new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. It increases our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new EU data protection rules. Security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions could expose us to liability and affect our business and reputation.We are increasingly dependent on our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We collect, store and transmit sensitive information including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information in connection with business operations. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Some of this information could be an attractive target of criminal attack by third parties with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” patient groups, disgruntled current or former employees and others. Cyber-attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication, and despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to such attacks or may be breached, including due to employee error or malfeasance. We have implemented information security measures to protect patients’ personal information against the risk of inappropriate and unauthorized external use and disclosure. However, despite these measures, and due to the ever changing information cyber-threat landscape, we may be subject to data breaches through cyber-attacks. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. If our systems become compromised, we may not promptly discover the intrusion. Like other companies in our industry, we have experienced attacks to our data and systems, including malware and computer viruses. If our systems failed or were breached  or disrupted, we could lose product sales, and suffer reputational damage and loss of customer confidence. Such incidents may result in notification obligations to affected individuals and government agencies, legal claims or proceedings, and liability under foreign, federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Any one of these events could cause our business to be materially harmed and our results of operations may be adversely impacted.Negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of recombinant and transgenic products, genetically modified products and genetically modified animals generally may damage public perception of our current and future products or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and obtain regulatory approvals we may seek.KANUMA is a transgenic product produced in the egg whites of genetically modified chickens who receive copies of the human lysosomal acid lipase gene to produce recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase. The success of KANUMA may depend in part on public attitudes of the use of genetic engineering. Public attitudes may be influenced by claims and perceptions that these types of activities or products are unsafe, and our products may not gain sufficient acceptance by, or fall out of favor with, the public or the medical community. Negative public attitudes to genetic engineering activities in general could result in more restrictive legislation or regulations and could impede our ability to conduct our business, delay preclinical or clinical studies, or otherwise prevent us from commercializing our product.Risks Related to Intellectual PropertyIf we cannot obtain new patents, maintain our existing patents and protect the confidentiality and proprietary nature of our trade secrets and other intellectual property, our business and competitive position may be harmed.Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and regulatory protections for our products and investigational compounds, to preserve our trade secrets and other proprietary rights, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to prevent third parties from circumventing our rights. Due to the time and expense of bringing new products through development and regulatory approval to the marketplace, there is particular importance in obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes.We have and may in the future obtain patents or the right to practice patents through ownership or license. Our patent applications may not result in the issue of patents in the U.S. or other countries. In addition, a patent may be issued in one country, but a counterpart patent may not be issued in another country. For example, we have applied for a certain patent in the 82EU that would provide protection for the composition of matter for SOLIRIS through 2027, and while a similar patent was granted in the U.S., the European patent application remains under examination by the European Patent Office and a hearing on it scheduled for February 2019 has been delayed until later in the year. Even if a patent is issued, that is not conclusive as to inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability and therefore that patent may not afford adequate (or any) protection for our products. Third parties may challenge our patents, and have challenged our patents in the past and, in some cases have been successful in such challenges. For example, on January 21, 2019, the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office determined, following multi-party opposition proceedings, to revoke our European patent No. 2359834, which relates to the formulation of SOLIRIS and on February 28, 2019, Amgen Inc. petitioned the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to institute inter partes review of three of our patents that relate to SOLIRIS. In addition to the protections afforded by patents (which, as noted above are subject to challenge and potentially invalidation), certain of our products do benefit from regulatory protections for applicable indications in certain geographies that allow such protections. For example, SOLIRIS is protected in Europe by orphan drug exclusivity through late 2023 for aHUS and until 2027 for gMG. If any of our patents are narrowed, invalidated, revoked or become unenforceable, competitors may develop and market products similar to ours that do not conflict with or infringe our patents rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We may also finance and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations, hospitals, universities or other educational or research institutions. Such research partners may be unwilling to grant us exclusive rights to technology or products developed through such collaborations. There is also a risk that disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or products developed in collaboration with other parties. Our products and product candidates are expensive and time-consuming to test and develop. Even if we obtain and maintain patents, our business may be significantly harmed if the patents are not broad enough to protect our products from copycat products.Significant legal questions exist concerning the extent and scope of patent protection for biopharmaceutical products and processes in the U.S. and elsewhere. Accordingly, there is no certainty that patent applications owned or licensed by us will issue as patents, or that our issued patents will afford meaningful protection against competitors. Once issued, patents are subject to challenge through both administrative and judicial proceedings in the U.S. and other countries. Such proceedings include re-examinations, inter partes reviews, post-grant reviews  and interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as opposition proceedings before the European Patent Office and other non-U.S. patent offices. Certain countries have laws that provide stronger bases for challenging third party patent rights than are available to challenge patents in other countries. Therefore, we may be able to defend our patents against a third party claim in one country but counterpart patents may be invalidated in other countries and we may be able to invalidate a third-party patent in one country but not invalidate its counterpart patents in other countries. Litigation may be required to enforce, defend or obtain our patent and other intellectual property rights. Any administrative proceeding or litigation could require a significant commitment of our resources and, depending on outcome, could adversely affect the scope, validity or enforceability of certain of our patent or other proprietary rights.In addition, our business requires using sensitive technology, techniques and proprietary compounds that we protect as trade secrets. However, we may also rely heavily on collaboration with, or discuss the potential for collaboration with, suppliers, outside scientists and other biopharmaceutical companies, including in connection with development efforts such as those with Complement Pharma and Dicerna. Collaboration and discussion of potential collaboration present a strong risk of exposing our trade secrets. If our trade secrets were exposed, we may lose the protection and potential exclusive rights afforded by trade secret law, and such exposure may likely help our competitors and allow them to access technology without restriction and adversely affect our business prospects.If we are found to be infringing third party patents, we may be forced to pay damages to the patent owner and/or obtain a license to continue the manufacture, sale or development of our products. If we cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from the manufacture, sale or development of our products or product candidates, which may adversely affect our business.Parts of our technology, techniques, proprietary compounds and potential product candidates, including those which are or may be in-licensed, may be found to infringe patents owned by or granted to others. We have and may in the future receive notices claiming our products infringe third party patents and third parties have and may in the future file civil lawsuits against us claiming infringement of their intellectual property rights. In late-2018, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. filed suits in the U.S. and Japan alleging that ULTOMIRIS infringes a U.S. and two Japanese patents, respectively, held by Chugai (these suits are still in the early stages). Additional third parties may claim that the manufacture, use or sale of our products or product candidates infringes patents owned or granted to such third parties. We are aware of patents owned by third parties that 83might be claimed by such third parties to be infringed by the development and commercialization of our products or investigational compounds. In respect to some of these patents, we have obtained licenses, or expect to obtain licenses. However, with regard to other patents, we have determined in our judgment that:•our products and investigational compounds do not infringe the patents;•the patents are not valid or enforceable; and/or•we have identified and are testing various alternatives that should not infringe the patents and which should permit continued development and commercialization of our products and investigational compounds.Any holder of these patents or other patents covering similar technology could sue us for damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing, selling or developing our products. Intellectual property disputes, such as those initiated by Chugai, can be costly and time consuming to defend. Prior to launch of a new product (or an existing product for a new indication), for various reasons, a patent owner may not be able to assert its patent rights so it is possible that any potential challenges to our products may be made after a product has been commercialized and not necessarily while the product is in development, in clinical trials or during the regulatory review process. If we cannot successfully defend against any future actions or conflicts, if they arise, we may incur substantial legal costs and may be liable for damages, be required to obtain costly licenses or be forced to stop manufacturing, using or selling our products (and we may be, in certain cases, prevented from initiating product launches in certain jurisdictions), which may adversely affect our business. We may seek to obtain a license prior to or during legal actions in order to reduce the risks in connection with product launches (or at a later time) and to reduce further costs and the risk of a court determination that our technology, techniques, proprietary compounds or potential product candidates infringe the third party’s patents. A required license may be costly or may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. A costly license, or inability to obtain a necessary license, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, even if we obtained a license, it would likely be non-exclusive and any competitive advantage resulting from the licensed technology may be of limited value and the same technology could be utilized by competitors.In some instances, we believe we may prevail in a patent infringement action. There can, however, be no assurance that the court will agree with our position or that they will decide this or any other infringement case in our favor. Nor can we be certain that, if we do not prevail in litigation, that we may be able to obtain a license to any third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms or at all; successfully develop non- infringing alternatives on a timely basis (or at all); or license alternative non-infringing technology, if any exists, on commercially reasonable terms (or at all). Any impediment to our ability to manufacture, use or sell approved forms of our products or our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.It is possible that we could lose market exclusivity for a product earlier than expected, which may harm our competitive position.In our industry, much of an innovative product’s commercial value is realized while it has market exclusivity. When market exclusivity expires and biosimilar or generic versions of the product are approved and marketed, there can be substantial decline in the innovative product’s sales.Market exclusivity for our products is based upon patent rights and certain regulatory forms of protection. The scope of our product patent rights vary from country to country and is dependent on the availability of meaningful legal remedies in each country. The failure to obtain patent and other intellectual property rights, or limitations on the use, or loss of such rights, could be material to our business. In some countries, patent protections for our products may not exist because certain countries did not historically offer the right to obtain specific types of patents or we did not file patents in those markets. Also, the patent environment is unpredictable and the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Absent relevant patent protection for a product, once regulatory exclusivity periods expire, biosimilar or generic versions of the product can be approved and marketed. For example, in 2019, a SOLIRIS biosimilar was approved in Russia for the treatment of patients with PNH and aHUS. Even prior to the expiration of regulatory exclusivity, a competitor could seek to obtain marketing approval by submitting its own clinical trial data.The market exclusivity of our products may be impacted by competitive products that are either innovative or biosimilar or generic copies. In our industry, the potential for biosimilar challenges has been an increasing risk to product market exclusivity. U.S. law includes an approval pathway for biosimilar versions of innovative biological products. Under the pathway, the FDA may approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required for a full biologic license application. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, other manufacturers may apply for approval of a biosimilar version of the innovator product. However, qualified innovative biological products will receive 12 years of regulatory market exclusivity (i.e., the biosimilar product cannot be approved before 12 years after the innovative biological product). The law also provides a mechanism for innovators to enforce their patents that protect their 84products and for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents. Such litigation may begin as early as four years after the innovative biological product is first approved by the FDA. Pathways for biosimilar products also exist in many other markets, including Europe, Japan and Russia. Other companies are developing and advancing SOLIRIS biosimilar programs, including conducting clinical trials. Competition, including from biosimilars approved for marketing, may likely result in a decrease in prices, increased promotion efforts and lower margins for our products. In addition, approval of a biosimilar that is substitutable for one of our products may increase the risk of accelerated market penetration by that biosimilar. Further, if patients or healthcare providers do not believe that ULTOMIRIS provides a compelling profile for patient conversion from SOLIRIS, a SOLIRIS biosimilar may not only be expected to have a material and negative impact on our SOLIRIS revenues and margins (which accounted for a significant percentage of our revenue in 2018), it may also have a material impact on ULTOMIRIS revenue and margins and the ability of ULTOMIRIS to gain market acceptance.Our other products are also at risk from biosimilars. Other than SOLIRIS for the treatment of gMG and SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS as a treatment for PNH, each of our products is currently the only approved drug for the disease(s) the product treats. If a competitive product is approved for sale, including a biosimilar or generic product, our market share and our revenues could decline, particularly if the competitive product is perceived to be more effective or is less expensive than our product.Risks Related to Our Common StockOur stock price is volatile.The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Many factors could have an impact on our stock price, including fluctuations in our or our competitors’ operating results, clinical trial results or adverse events associated with our products, product development by us or our competitors, changes in laws, including healthcare, tax or intellectual property laws, intellectual property developments, changes in reimbursement or drug pricing, the existence or outcome of litigation or government proceedings, including the SEC/DOJ investigation and the Chugai lawsuits alleging patent infringement, acquisitions or other strategic transactions, and the perceptions of our investors that we are not performing or meeting expectations. The  trading price of the common stock of many biopharmaceutical companies, including ours, has experienced price and volume fluctuations, which have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies whose stocks were affectedAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult and may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current management.Our corporate charter and by-law provisions may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control that might be beneficial to us or our stockholders. Our bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President, the Secretary, or a majority of the Board of Directors, or upon the written request of stockholders who together own of record 25.0% of the outstanding stock of all classes entitled to vote at such meeting. Our bylaws also specify that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board of Directors. Our charter does not include a provision for cumulative voting for directors, which may have enabled a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares to elect one or more directors. Under our charter, our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to designate up to five million shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future.Because we are a Delaware corporation, the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control may be beneficial to stockholders. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Laws, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15.0% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15.0% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.ISSUER PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES (amounts in millions, except per share amounts)The following table summarizes our common stock repurchase activity during the first quarter 2019:PeriodTotal Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Programs Maximum Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the ProgramJanuary 1-31, 2019— $— — $451.5February 1-28, 2019— $— — $451.5March 1-31, 20190.1 $133.0 0.1 $440.1Total0.1 $133.0 0.1  In November 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program.
