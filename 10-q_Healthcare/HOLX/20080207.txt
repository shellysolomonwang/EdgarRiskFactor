Item 1A. Risk Factors  There are no material changes from risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 29, 2007 other than the risks related to our 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2037, which we refer to as the “Convertible Notes,” as set forth below:  Our Convertible Notes are unsecured, are effectively subordinated to our secured indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries, including trade payables and policyholder liabilities.  Our Convertible Notes are unsecured, will be effectively subordinated to all secured indebtedness we may incur, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries, including trade payables and policyholder liabilities. The indenture relating to our Convertible Notes does not restrict our ability to incur secured indebtedness in the future. In the event of our insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or winding up, we may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on any or all of our Convertible Notes then outstanding.  None of our subsidiaries has guaranteed or otherwise become obligated with respect to our Convertible Notes. Our right to receive assets from any of our subsidiaries upon its liquidation or reorganization, and the right of a note holders to participate in those assets, is structurally subordinated to claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. Even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of that subsidiary senior to that held by us. Furthermore, none of our subsidiaries is under any obligation to make payments to us, and any payments to us would depend on the earnings or financial condition of our subsidiaries and various business considerations. Statutory, contractual or other restrictions may also limit our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make distributions, loans or advances to us. For these reasons, we may not have access to any assets or cash flows of our subsidiaries to make payments on our Convertible Notes.  We may incur additional indebtedness ranking equal to our Convertible Notes.  If we incur any additional debt that ranks equally with our Convertible Notes, including trade payables, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of our Convertible Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of us. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to our note holders, if any.    52    Table of Contents Future issuances of common stock and hedging activities may depress the trading price of our common stock and our Convertible Notes.  Any future issuance of equity securities, including the issuance of shares upon conversion of our Convertible Notes, could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders, including holders who have received shares upon conversion of their notes, and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and our Convertible Notes. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons.  In addition, the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our Convertible Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock. The hedging or arbitrage could, in turn, affect the trading price of our Convertible Notes, or any common stock that note holders receive upon conversion of their notes.  Future sales of our common stock in the public market or the issuance of securities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the value of our Convertible Notes and our ability to raise funds in new securities offerings.  Future sales of our common stock, the perception that such sales could occur or the availability for future sales of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock could adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and the value of our Convertible Notes prevailing from time to time and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. In addition, we may issue common stock or equity securities senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of options or for other reasons.  Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility.  The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations and, therefore, the trading price of our Convertible Notes may fluctuate significantly, which may result in losses to investors. Our stock price may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors, including:        •    trends in our industry and the markets in which we operate;        •    changes in the market price of the products we sell;        •    the results of ongoing or future litigation;        •    changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;        •    operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;        •    announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions , strategic partnerships, joint ventures, financings or capital commitments;        •    changes in laws and regulations; and        •    general economic and competitive conditions.  This volatility may adversely affect the prices of our common stock and our Convertible Notes regardless of our operating performance. The price of our common stock also may be adversely affected by the amount of common stock issuable upon conversion of our Convertible Notes.  There may be adverse consequences to note holders who convert Convertible Notes they hold if we elect to settle all or any portion of our conversion obligation in cash (other than cash solely in lieu of any fractional shares) or if we irrevocably elect net share settlement upon conversion.    53    Table of Contents If we elect to settle all or any portion of our conversion obligation under the Convertible Notes in cash (other than cash solely in lieu of any fractional shares) or if we irrevocably elect net share settlement upon conversion it may:        •    result in a holder receiving no shares upon conversion or fewer shares relative to the conversion value of the Convertible Notes;        •    reduce our liquidity to the extent we settle a portion of our conversion obligation in cash;        •    delay the note holders’ receipt of the consideration due upon conversion; and        •    subject the note holders to market risk before receiving any shares upon conversion.  Under our Convertible Notes, a converting note holder will be exposed to fluctuations in the value of our common stock during the period from the date such holder surrenders notes for conversion until the date we settle our conversion obligation. Under our Convertible Notes, if we elect to settle all or any portion of our conversion obligation in cash (other than cash solely in lieu of any fractional shares) or if we irrevocably elect net share settlement upon conversion, the amount of consideration that a note holder will receive upon conversion of its notes is in part determined by reference to reported trading prices of our common stock during an observation period. If the price of our common stock decreases during this period, the amount of consideration our note holders receive will be adversely affected. In addition, if we elect to settle a portion, but less than all, of our conversion obligation in cash (other than cash solely in lieu of any fractional shares) or if we irrevocably elect net share settlement upon conversion, and the market price of our common stock at the end of such observation period is below the average daily trading price during such period, the value of any shares of our common stock that a note holder will receive in satisfaction of our conversion obligation will be less than the value used to determine the number of shares such holder will receive.  The conversion rate of our Convertible Notes may not be adjusted for all dilutive events that may occur.  We will adjust the conversion rate of our Convertible Notes for certain events, including, among others:        •    the issuance of stock or cash dividends on our common stock;        •    the issuance of certain rights or warrants;        •    certain subdivisions and combinations of our capital stock;        •    the distribution of capital stock, indebtedness or assets; and        •    certain tender or exchange offers.  We will not adjust the conversion rate for other events, such as an issuance of common stock for cash or in connection with an acquisition, that may adversely affect the trading price of our Convertible Notes or our common stock. If we engage in any of these types of transactions, the value of the common stock into which a note holder’s notes may be convertible may be diluted. An event that adversely affects the value of our Convertible Notes, but does not result in an adjustment to the conversion rate may occur.  The increase in the conversion rate applicable to notes that a note holder convert in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may not adequately compensate such holder for the lost option time value of such holder’s notes as a result of that designated event.  If a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of our Convertible Notes, we will in some cases increase the conversion rate for a note holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. The amount of the increase in the conversion rate depends on the date when such make-whole fundamental change becomes effective and the applicable price.  Although the increase in the conversion rate is designed to compensate our note holders for the lost option time value of their notes as a result of such designated event, the increase in the conversion rate is only an approximation of the lost value and may not adequately compensate our note holders for the loss. In addition, a note holder will not be entitled to an increased conversion rate if:        •    a note holder convert its notes prior to the effective date of any make-whole fundamental change, and the make-whole fundamental change does not occur; or    54    Table of Contents     •    the applicable price is greater than $350.00 per share or less than $61.75 per share (in each case, subject to adjustment).  Our obligation to increase the conversion rate as described above also could be considered a penalty, in which case its enforceability would be subject to general principles of reasonableness of economic remedies. In addition, we will not increase the conversion rate to an amount, subject to adjustment, that exceeds 16.1943 shares per $1,000 in original principal amount of notes.  We may not have the ability to pay interest on our Convertible Notes, to purchase our Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change or to pay any cash payment due upon conversion.  Our Convertible Notes bear cash interest semiannually at a rate of 2.00% per year, beginning June 15, 2008 and ending on December 15, 2013. In addition, beginning with the six-month interest period commencing December 15, 2013, we may have to pay additional contingent interest to note holders if the market price of our Convertible Notes exceeds certain thresholds. On each of December 13, 2013, December 15, 2017, December 15, 2022, December 15, 2027 and December 15, 2032, or if a fundamental change occurs, note holders may require us to repurchase, for cash, all or a portion of their notes. In addition, if we have made an irrevocable net share settlement election, then upon conversion of our Convertible Notes we must pay at least the accreted principal portion in cash. We may not have sufficient funds to pay the interest, repurchase price or accreted principal portion when due. If we fail to pay interest on our Convertible Notes, repurchase our Convertible Notes or pay the cash payment due upon conversion when required, we will be in default under the indenture governing our Convertible Notes.  Our note holders may not be able to convert their notes before September 15, 2037, and the value of the Convertible Notes could be less than the value of the common stock into which such note holders’ notes could otherwise be converted.  Prior to September 15, 2037, our Convertible Notes are convertible only if specified conditions are met. These conditions may not be met. If these conditions for conversion are not met, a note holder will not be able to convert its notes and such holder may not be able to receive the value of the common stock into which our Convertible Notes would otherwise be convertible. In addition, for these and other reasons, the trading price of our Convertible Notes could be substantially less than the conversion value of our Convertible Notes.  We have made only limited covenants in the indenture for our Convertible Notes, and these limited covenants may not protect our note holders’ investment.  The indenture for our Convertible Notes does not:        •    require us to maintain any financial ratios or specific levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flows or liquidity and, accordingly, does not protect holders of our Convertible Notes in the event that we experience significant adverse changes in our financial condition or results of operations;        •    limit our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness which would effectively rank senior to our Convertible Notes;        •    limit our ability to incur secured indebtedness or indebtedness that is equal in right of payment to our Convertible Notes;        •    restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to issue securities that would be senior to the common stock of our subsidiaries held by us;        •    restrict our ability to repurchase our securities;        •    restrict our ability to pledge our assets or those of our subsidiaries; or        •    restrict our ability to make investments or to pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our common stock or other securities ranking junior to our Convertible Notes.  Furthermore, the indenture for our Convertible Notes contains only limited protections in the event of a change in control and similar transactions. We could engage in many types of transactions, such as acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that could substantially affect our capital structure and the value of our Convertible Notes and our common stock but may not constitute a designated event that permits holders to require us to repurchase their notes.    55    Table of Contents The definition of a fundamental change requiring us to repurchase our Convertible Notes is limited and, therefore, the market price of our Convertible Notes may decline if we enter into a transaction that is not a fundamental change under the indenture.  The term “fundamental change” requiring us to repurchase our Convertible Notes at a note holder’s option is limited to specified corporate transactions and may not include other events that might adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, the requirement that we offer to repurchase our Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change may not protect holders in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, merger or similar transaction involving us.  Conversion of our Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their notes.  To the extent we issue any shares of our common stock upon conversion of our Convertible Notes, the conversion of some or all of our Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, including holders who have received shares of our common stock upon prior conversion of our Convertible Notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of our Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of our Convertible Notes could depress the price of our common stock.  The accounting for convertible debt securities is subject to uncertainty.  The accounting for convertible debt securities is subject to frequent scrutiny by the accounting regulatory bodies and is subject to change. We cannot predict if or when any such change could be made and any such change could have an adverse impact on our reported or future financial results. Any such impacts could adversely affect the trading prices of our common stock and our Convertible Notes.  For example, the accounting method for net share settled convertible securities, which would include our Convertible Notes, has been under review by the accounting regulatory bodies for some time. Under the current accounting rules, for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, a net share settled convertible security meeting certain requirements is accounted for in a manner similar to nonconvertible debt, with the stated coupon constituting interest expense and any shares issuable upon conversion of the security being accounted for in a manner similar to the treasury stock method. The effect of this method is that the shares potentially issuable upon conversion of the securities are not included in the calculation of earnings per share until the conversion price is “in the money”, and the issuer is then assumed to issue the number of shares necessary to settle the conversion.  However, a proposal to change that accounting method has recently been made by the FASB. Under the proposal, cash settled convertible securities would be separated into their debt and equity components. The value assigned to the debt component would be the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature, and the difference between the proceeds for the convertible debt and the amount reflected as a debt liability would be recorded as additional paid-in capital. As a result, the debt would be recorded at a discount reflecting its below market coupon interest rate. The debt would subsequently be accreted to its par value over its expected life, with the rate of interest that reflects the market rate at issuance being reflected on the income statement. This change in methodology will affect the calculations of net income and earnings per share for many issuers of cash settled convertible securities.  Implementation of this proposal is ongoing and we cannot predict the exact methodology that will be imposed, which may differ materially from the foregoing description, or when any change will be finally implemented.  The note holders should consider the U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning our Convertible Notes.  Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing our Convertible Notes, we and every note holder have agreed (in the absence of an administrative pronouncement or judicial ruling to the contrary), for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to treat our Convertible Notes as debt that is subject to the Treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments, which we refer to as the contingent debt regulations.  Our Convertible Notes will be treated as issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and a note holder is required to include such tax original issue discount in its income as it accrues. The amount of tax original issue discount required to be included by a note holder in its income for each year generally will be in excess of the payments and accruals on our Convertible Notes for non-tax purposes (i.e., in excess of the stated semi-annual regular interest payments and accruals and possibly in excess of any contingent interest payments) in that year.    56    Table of Contents A note holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, conversion, redemption or repurchase of a note in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized, including the fair market value of any shares of our common stock received, and such note holder’s adjusted tax basis in the note. Any gain recognized by a note holder on the sale, exchange, conversion, redemption or repurchase of the notes will be treated as ordinary interest income; any loss will be ordinary loss to the extent of interest previously included in income, and thereafter will be treated as capital loss.  The conversion rate of our Convertible Notes will be adjusted in certain circumstances. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and applicable Treasury regulations, adjustments that have the effect of increasing a U.S. holder’s interest in our assets or earnings and profits (such as a conversion rate adjustment in connection with a payment of dividends to our shareholders) may, in some circumstances, result in a deemed distribution to the U.S. holder.  Our note holders are not entitled to any rights with respect to our common stock, but are subject to all changes made with respect to our common stock.  Our note holders are not entitled to any rights with respect to our common stock (including, without limitation, voting rights and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on our common stock), but they are subject to all changes affecting our common stock. A note holder will have the rights with respect to our common stock only when we deliver shares of common stock, if any, to such holder upon conversion of such holder’s notes. For example, in the event that an amendment is proposed to our charter or by-laws requiring stockholder approval and the record date for determining the stockholders of record entitled to vote on the amendment occurs prior to the date a note holder is deemed to have received common stock, if any, upon conversion, such holder will not be entitled to vote on the amendment, although such holder will nevertheless be subject to any changes in the powers, preferences or special rights of our common stock. In addition, because of the contingent conversion and net share settlement features of our Convertible Notes, our note holders may not be able to convert their notes until September 15, 2037, and they may not receive any shares upon conversion.  Provisions in the indenture for our Convertible Notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to our security holders.  If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of our Convertible Notes, holders of our Convertible Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of our Convertible Notes, we will in some cases increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such designated event. In addition, the indenture for our Convertible Notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under our Convertible Notes. These and other provisions could prevent or deter a third party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to our stockholder or our note holders.      Item 2.
