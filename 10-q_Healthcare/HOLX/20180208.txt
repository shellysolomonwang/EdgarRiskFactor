Item 1A. Risk Factors.There are no material changes from the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, except as noted below.The impact of recently enacted U.S. tax laws is not yet clear. Congress recently enacted legislation commonly known as “ The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “Act”). The Act made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws. Certain provisions of the Act could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company or its affiliates. The interpretations of many provisions of the Act are still unclear. We cannot predict when or to what extent any U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations, or rulings clarifying the Act will be issued or the impact of any such guidance on the Company. Certain key provisions of the Act that could impact us include, but are not limited to international tax provisions that affect the overall tax rate applicable to income earned from non-U.S. operations, limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation and limitations on a taxpayer’s net interest expense deduction. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
