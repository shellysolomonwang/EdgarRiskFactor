Item 1A. Risk Factors  There are no material changes in the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 27, 2008 except as set forth below:  Based upon a combination of factors, including the deteriorating macro-economic environment, declines in the stock market and the decline of our market capitalization below the book value of our net assets, we concluded that potential goodwill impairment indicators existed as of December 27, 2008 that could require us to incur an impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 that would have a material adverse impact on our operating results.  We periodically review the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets reflected in our financial statements to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment of the value of these assets. Based upon a combination of factors, including the deteriorating macro-economic environment, declines in the stock market and the decline of our market capitalization significantly below the book value of our net assets, we concluded that potential goodwill impairment indicators existed as of December 27, 2008. As a result, we are performing an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of December 27, 2008. Step 1 of our impairment analysis indicates that the carrying value of the net assets of certain reporting units, primarily acquired in connection with the Cytyc acquisition, exceeds the estimated fair value of those reporting units. These reporting units had goodwill totaling approximately $4.0 billion, as of December 27, 2008. As a result, we will be required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment charges by reporting unit to be recorded by us. We expect to complete the Step 2 analysis by the end of our fiscal second quarter, March 28, 2009. In the event that we determine that our goodwill is impaired in whole or in part, we will record an impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, which could have a material adverse impact our operating results.      Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
