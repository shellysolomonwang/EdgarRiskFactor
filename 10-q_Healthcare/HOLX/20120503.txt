Item 1A. Risk Factors  There are no material changes from the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 24, 2011, other than risks we face in connection with our proposed acquisition of Gen-Probe Incorporated and the related financing anticipated in connection with that transaction. We encourage you to consider the risks set forth below under the captions “—Risks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of Gen-Probe Incorporated,” and “—Risks Related to Additional Indebtedness” for a description of certain of the risks related to those transactions.  RISKS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF GEN-PROBE INCORPORATED  Failure to complete the acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.  If the acquisition is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including:        •    the attention of our management will have been diverted to the acquisition instead of on our own operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us;        •    customer perception may be negatively impacted which could affect our ability to compete for, or to win, new and renewal business in the marketplace;        •    we will have incurred significant costs relating to the acquisition, such as legal, accounting, and financial advisor fees; and        •    if the merger fails to close as a result of our financing not being available, we may be required to pay Gen-Probe a financing failure fee of $200 million.  Obtaining required clearances and approvals, and satisfying closing conditions may delay or prevent completion of the acquisition or reduce the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.  Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of all material governmental authorizations, clearances, orders and approvals, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and under any similar foreign statutes and regulations applicable to the merger. The governmental agencies from which we will seek these clearances or approvals have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. As a condition to approval of the merger, agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business. These requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay  the completion of the merger or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Further, we cannot assure that the required clearances or approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied. Even if all required clearances and approvals are obtained and the conditions to the completion of the merger are satisfied, we cannot give any assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or whether such terms and conditions will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We may be unable to successfully integrate Gen-Probe’s operations or to realize the anticipated cost savings, revenues and other benefits of the acquisition. As a result, the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.  We entered into the merger agreement because we believe that the acquisition will be beneficial to us and our stockholders. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will depend in part upon whether we can integrate Gen-Probe’s businesses in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully. The necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. We and Gen-Probe operate numerous systems, including those involving management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, employee benefits, payroll and regulatory compliance. Moreover the integration of our respective operations following the acquisition will require the dedication of significant management resources, which is likely to distract management’s attention from day-to-day operations. Employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may also disrupt our business and result in undesired employee attrition. An inability of management to successfully integrate the operations of the two companies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefits of the acquisition. An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We will incur significant transaction and acquisition-related costs in connection with the acquisition.  We expect to incur significant costs associated with acquiring Gen-Probe and combining the operations of the two companies. The substantial majority of the expenses resulting from the acquisition will be comprised of transaction costs related to the acquisition, systems consolidation costs, and business integration and employment-related costs. We may also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses. Due to legal restrictions, we have been able to conduct only limited planning regarding the integration of the two companies and have not yet been able to formulate detailed integration plans to deliver anticipated synergies. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.  Whether or not the acquisition is completed, the announcement and pendency of the acquisition could impact or cause disruptions in our and Gen-Probe’s businesses.  Specifically:        •    our and Gen-Probe’s current and prospective customers and suppliers may experience uncertainty associated with the acquisition, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us, Gen-Probe or the combined company and may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business;        •    Our and Gen-Probe’s employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which may adversely affect our and Gen-Probe’s ability to retain and hire key employees;        •    the acquisition may give rise to potential liabilities, including Gen-Probe shareholder lawsuits alleging breaches of fiduciary duty relating to the merger;        •    if the acquisition is completed, the accelerated vesting of stock options and other equity-based awards and payment of “change in control” benefits to some members of Gen-Probe’s management on completion of the acquisition could result in increased difficulty or cost in retaining Gen-Probe’s officers and employees; and        •    the attention of our management and that of Gen-Probe may be directed toward the completion of the acquisition and transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of the respective companies.  The acquisition is expected to have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock following the acquisition.  The acquisition is expected to have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP primarily due to the amortization of the intangible assets in connection with the acquisition. These expectations are based on preliminary estimates which may materially change after the completion of the acquisition. We could also encounter additional transaction and integration-related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition. All of these factors could cause further dilution to our earnings per share or cause a decrease in the price of our common stock.  Charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting may adversely affect the market value of our common stock following the acquisition.  In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting, which will result in charges to our earnings that could adversely affect the market value of our common stock following the completion of the merger. Under the purchase method of accounting, we will allocate the total purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Gen-Probe based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the effective time of the merger, and record any excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. For certain tangible and intangible assets, recording their fair values as of the completion date of the merger will result in us incurring significant additional depreciation and/or amortization expense that exceed the combined amounts recorded by us and Gen-Probe prior to the merger. This increased expense will be recorded by us over the useful lives of the underlying assets. In addition, to the extent the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets post-acquisition were to become impaired, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of those assets.  RISKS RELATED TO ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS  The financing arrangements under our commitment letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations.  We have entered into a firm debt commitment letter with Goldman Sachs Bank USA (“GS Bank”) and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC (“GS Lending”), dated April 29, 2012, to provide financing, among other things, to pay the merger consideration contemplated by our proposed acquisition of Gen-Probe. The financing contemplated by that commitment letter is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or capital resources, including the following:        •    the funding of our commitment is contingent on the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the commitment letter, including there not having occurred, since December 31, 2011, a Gen-Probe material adverse effect (as defined in the commitment letter);        •    the terms of the proposed financing are subject to modification and adjustment (known as flex) by our lenders, including in response to then prevailing market conditions, which could substantially increase the interest rate and other costs of the financing;        •    the terms, conditions and covenants of the new financing facilities are subject to the negotiation, execution and delivery of definitive credit documents, and we cannot assure that such terms will not be more restrictive than we currently anticipate; and        •    if the merger fails to close as a result of our financing not being available, we may be required to pay Gen-Probe a financing failure fee of $200 million.  We cannot assure that we will obtain financing on the terms we anticipate, if at all.  We will incur significant indebtedness in order to finance the acquisition, which will limit our operating flexibility, and could adversely affect our operations and financial results and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.  In order to finance the acquisition and other expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition, we intend to incur up to $3.8 billion of new indebtedness, consisting of a combination of secured term loans, a revolving credit facility and additional unsecured notes or loans. Additionally, our indebtedness under our convertible notes, in the aggregate principle amount of $1.725 billion, will remain outstanding. Our new secured credit facilities are anticipated to bear interest at variable rates dependent upon our credit rating. This level of indebtedness may:        •    make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;        •    increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates;        •    require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes;        •    limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;        •    place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and        •    limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes and acquisitions.  In addition, the terms of the financing obligations to be incurred in connection with the acquisition will contain covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, including, among other things, limitations on our ability to:        •    incur additional indebtedness;        •    pay dividends and make distributions;        •    repurchase stock;        •    make certain investments;        •    create liens;        •    engage in transactions with affiliates;        •    merge with or acquire another company; and        •    transfer and sell assets.  Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, political decisions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the proposed new credit and other financing facilities could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.  If there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments or a change of control, the holders of such debt could cause all amounts outstanding to be due and payable immediately and may be cross-defaulted to other debt. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments under our indebtedness.  We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our obligations, including our obligations under our new credit and other financing facilities.  Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition, and to fund planned capital expenditures, strategic transactions and expansion efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  Our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, and we cannot assure that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as such indebtedness matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. If this is the case, we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, and we cannot assure that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may need to implement one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing. These financing strategies may not be executed on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, will depend on, among other things, our financial condition at the time, restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness, and other factors, including the condition of the financial markets and the markets in which we will compete.  If we do not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, and additional borrowings, refinancings or proceeds of asset sales are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations.
