Item 1A. Risk Factors  There are no material changes in the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 25, 2010, except as noted below.  Our business may be harmed by recently completed acquisitions in China.   We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate and operate TCT and Healthcome, the businesses we recently acquired in China. There are significant risks, known and unknown, associated with these recent acquisitions, including without limitation those risks set forth in Item 1A in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the headings: “Our international operations and foreign acquisitions expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face,” “Our business may be harmed by recently completed acquisitions or acquisitions we may complete in the future,” and “Fluctuations in the exchange rates of European currencies and the other foreign currencies in which we conduct our business, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could harm our business and prospects.”  In addition to and without limiting these prior risk factors, we expect that the operations of TCT and Heathcome within China will create enhanced risks and challenges to the Company in successfully integrating and operating those businesses, including, without limitation:        •    difficulties in staffing and managing operations in foreign locations as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences;        •    protectionist laws and business practices that may favor local companies;        •    difficulties in trade accounts receivable collection;        •    difficulties and expenses related to implementing internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;        •    expenses associated with customizing products for clients in foreign countries;        •    possible adverse tax consequences;        •    the inability to obtain favorable third-party reimbursements;        •    the inability to obtain required regulatory approvals;        •    governmental currency controls;        •    multiple, conflicting and changing government laws and regulations (including, among other things, antitrust and tax requirements, international trade regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act);        •    the inability to effectively obtain or enforce intellectual property rights or otherwise protect against clone or “knock off” products; and        •    political and economic changes and disruptions, export/import controls, and tariff regulations.  Moreover, the businesses of TCT and Healthcome may be adversely affected by future legislative, regulatory, or tax changes as well as changes in international currency exchange rates and other economic, business and competitive factors. Our failure to integrate and operate these acquired businesses successfully could harm our business and prospects and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.    41    Table of Contents   Item 2.
