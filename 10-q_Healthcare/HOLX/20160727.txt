Item 1A. Risk Factors.There are no material changes from the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 26, 2015, except as noted below.The potential withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the uncertainties and concerns arising from such potential withdrawal could adversely affect our business and prospects.On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom ("UK") held a referendum in which voters approved a withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the UK’s exit from the European Union. Brexit could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the UK and the European Union, undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas and significantly disrupt trade between the UK and the European Union. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what economic, financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union would have and how such withdrawal may affect us.  We have a manufacturing facility in the UK. In the event of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges that may have a material adverse effect on us and our operations. For example, depending on the terms of Brexit, we could become subject to export tariffs and regulatory restrictions that could increase the costs and time related to doing business in Europe. Additionally, Brexit could result in the UK or the European Union significantly altering its regulations affecting the clearance or approval of our products that are developed or manufactured in the UK. Any new regulations could add time and expense to the conduct of our business, as well as the process by which our products receive regulatory approval in the UK, the European Union and elsewhere.Item 2.
