Item 1A. Risk Factors    For a complete discussion of the Company's risk factors, refer to Item 1A "Risk Factors" on pages 9-17 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. There have been no material changes from the information discussed therein except for the risk factor set forth below, which is restated in its entirety.    General economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.    External factors can affect our profitability and financial condition. Such external factors include general economic conditions, such as interest rates and tax rates, and the political environment regarding healthcare in general. For example, an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets. In March 2010, significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the United States. The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes. Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013. The excise tax will increase the Company's operating expenses. The new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for the Company's products, and impact the demand for the Company's products or the prices at which the Company sells its products.
