products for purposes of segment reporting. Our business segments are distinguished by the
ultimate end user of the product: humans or animals. Performance is evaluated based on profit or
loss from operations before income taxes. Income before income taxes for the animal health
business was $47.6&nbsp;million and $32.0&nbsp;million for the quarters ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007,

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have prepared the accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements in
accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and, therefore, they do not include all information
and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).
In our opinion, the financial statements reflect all adjustments (including those that are normal
and recurring) that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the
periods shown. In preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, we must make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and
related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with

Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future
Research and Development Activities, on January&nbsp;1, 2008. Pursuant to EITF 07-3, nonrefundable
advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and
development activities should be deferred and capitalized. Such amounts should be recognized as an
expense when the related goods are delivered or services are performed, or when the goods or
services are no longer expected to be received. This Issue is to be applied prospectively for

framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
The implementation of this Statement was not material to our consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued Statement No.&nbsp;161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 applies to all
derivative instruments and related hedged items accounted for under FASB Statement No.&nbsp;133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This Statement requires entities to
provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how
derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its
related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity&#146;s
financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. This Statement is effective for us

The primary revisions to this Statement require an acquirer in a business combination to measure
assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the
acquisition date, at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions specified in the
Statement. This Statement also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages
to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest in the
acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values (or other amounts determined in accordance with
the Statement). Assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies as
of the acquisition date are to be measured at their acquisition-date fair values, and assets or
liabilities arising from all other contingencies as of the acquisition date are to be measured at

109, Accounting for Income Taxes, was also amended by this Statement to require the acquirer to
recognize changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable because of a
business combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination
or directly in contributed capital, depending on the circumstances. This Statement is effective
for us for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January&nbsp;1, 2009.

for Noncontrolling Interests. This Statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No.&nbsp;51,
Consolidated Financial Statements (ARB 51), by requiring companies to report a noncontrolling
interest in a subsidiary as equity in its consolidated financial statements. Disclosure of the
amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest will
be required. This Statement also clarifies that transactions that result in a change in a parent&#146;s
ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation will be treated as equity
transactions, while a gain or loss will be recognized by the parent when a subsidiary is
deconsolidated. This Statement is effective for us January&nbsp;1, 2009, and we do not anticipate the
implementation will be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties. This Issue is effective

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;20, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(SGX). The acquisition allows us to integrate SGX&#146;s structure-guided drug discovery platform into
our drug discovery efforts. It also gives us access to FAST<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">TM</SUP>, SGX&#146;s fragment-based,
protein structure guided drug discovery technology, and to a portfolio of preclinical oncology
compounds focused on a number of kinase targets. Under the terms of the agreement, the outstanding
shares of SGX common stock were redeemed for an aggregate purchase price, including transaction
costs, of approximately $66.5&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under the purchase method of
accounting. We allocated $28.7&nbsp;million of the purchase price to deferred tax assets and $28.0&nbsp;million
to acquired in-process research and development (IPR&#038;D). The IPR&#038;D represents products in
development and technology that were not yet approved for marketing or were not yet proven
technology and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, the $28.0&nbsp;million allocated to acquired
IPR&#038;D was expensed immediately subsequent to the acquisition. SGX&#146;s results of operations are

testing at the time of the acquisition represented approximately 48&nbsp;percent of the estimated fair
value of the IPR&#038;D. The remaining value of IPR&#038;D represents several other products in development,
with no one asset comprising a significant portion of this value. In accordance with FIN 4,
Applicability of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase
Method, these IPR&#038;D intangible assets totaling $303.5&nbsp;million were written off by a charge to
income immediately subsequent to the acquisition because the compounds had no alternative future
use. This charge was not deductible for tax purposes. The ongoing activity with respect to each
of these compounds under development is not material to our research and development expenses.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There are several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair value of the acquired
IPR&#038;D. We utilized the &#147;income method,&#148; which applies a probability weighting to the estimated
future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs. These
projections are based on factors such as relevant market size, patent protection, historical
pricing of similar products, and expected industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are
then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. This analysis is
performed for each project independently. The discount rate we used in valuing the acquired IPR&#038;D
projects was 20&nbsp;percent.

with respect to these companies&#146; products in development are not material to
our research and development expenses. The results of operations are included in our consolidated
condensed financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The acquisition of Hypnion provided us with a broader and more substantive presence in the area of
sleep disorder research and ownership of HY10275, a novel Phase II compound with a dual mechanism
of action aimed at promoting better sleep onset and sleep maintenance. This was Hypnion&#146;s only
significant asset. For this acquisition, we recorded a charge of $291.1&nbsp;million, representing the
estimated fair value of the acquired compound, to acquired IPR&#038;D in the second quarter of 2007
because the development-stage compound acquired had no alternative future use. This charge was not
deductible for tax purposes. Because Hypnion was a development-stage company, the transaction was
accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than as a business combination and, therefore,
goodwill was not recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The acquisition of Ivy provides us with products that complement those of our animal health product
line. This acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under the purchase method
of accounting. We have allocated $88.7&nbsp;million of the purchase price to other identifiable
intangible assets, primarily related to marketed products, $37.0&nbsp;million to acquired IPR&#038;D, and
$25.0&nbsp;million to goodwill. The IPR&#038;D represents products in development that were not yet approved
for marketing and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, the $37.0&nbsp;million allocated to
acquired IPR&#038;D was expensed immediately subsequent to the acquisition. The other identifiable
intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives of 10 to 20
years. Goodwill resulting from this acquisition was fully allocated to the animal health business
segment. The amount allocated to each of the intangible assets acquired, including goodwill, was
expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June&nbsp;2008, we entered into a licensing and development agreement with TransPharma Medical Ltd.
(TransPharma) to acquire rights to its product and related drug delivery system for the treatment
of osteoporosis. The product, which is administered transdermally using TransPharma&#146;s proprietary
technology, was in Phase II clinical testing, and had no alternative future use. Under
the arrangement, we also gain non-exclusive access to TransPharma&#146;s ViaDerm drug delivery system
for the product. As with many development-phase products, launch of the product, if approved, was
not expected in the near term. The charge of $35.0&nbsp;million for acquired IPR&#038;D related to this
arrangement was included as expense in the second quarter of 2008 and is deductible for tax
purposes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, we entered into an agreement with BioMS Medical Corp. to acquire the rights to
its compound for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. This agreement became effective upon
clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Anti-Trust Improvements Act in January&nbsp;2008. At the
inception of this agreement, this compound was in the development stage (Phase III clinical trials)
and had no alternative future use. As with many development-phase compounds, launch of the
product, if approved, was not expected in the near term. The charge of $87.0&nbsp;million for acquired
IPR&#038;D related to this arrangement was included as expense in the first quarter of 2008 and is
deductible for tax purposes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In October&nbsp;2007, we entered into a global strategic alliance with MacroGenics, Inc. (MacroGenics)
to develop and commercialize teplizumab, a humanized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, as well as other
potential next-generation anti-CD3 molecules for use in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. As
part of the arrangement, we acquired the exclusive rights to the molecule, which was in the
development stage (Phase II/III clinical trial for individuals with recent-onset type 1 diabetes) and had no
alternative future use. As with many development-phase compounds, launch of the product, if
approved, was not expected in the near term. The charge of $44.0&nbsp;million for acquired IPR&#038;D was
deductible for tax purposes and was included as expense in the fourth quarter of 2007.

terms of the agreement, both we and TPG will provide funding for the Alzheimer&#146;s clinical trials.
Funding from TPG will not exceed $325&nbsp;million and could extend into 2014. In exchange for their
funding, TPG may receive success-based milestones totaling $330&nbsp;million and mid-to
high-single-digit royalties that are contingent upon the successful development of the Alzheimer&#146;s
treatments. The royalties will be paid for approximately eight years after launch of a product.
Our reported research and development costs related to the Alzheimer&#146;s treatments are reflected net
of the at-risk funding we receive from TPG for their share of the development costs. The funding
from TPG is not expected to be material in any period.

<DIV style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the third quarter of 2008, as a result of our previously announced agreements with Covance
Inc. (Covance), Quintiles Transnational Corp. (Quintiles), and Ingenix Pharmaceutical Services,
Inc., doing business as i3 Statprobe (i3), and as part of our efforts to transform into a more
flexible organization, we recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges
of $182.4&nbsp;million. We sold our Greenfield, Indiana site to Covance, a global drug development
services firm, and entered into a 10-year service agreement under which Covance will provide
preclinical toxicology work and perform additional clinical trials for us as well as operate the
site to meet our needs and those of other pharmaceutical industry clients. In addition, we
signed agreements with Quintiles for clinical trial monitoring services and with i3 for
clinical data management services. Components of the third-quarter restructuring charge include
non-cash charges of $148.3&nbsp;million primarily related to the loss on sale of assets sold to
Covance, severance costs of $27.8&nbsp;million, and exit costs of $6.3&nbsp;million. Substantially all of
these costs will be paid in 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2008, we announced a voluntary exit program that was offered to employees primarily in
manufacturing. In the second quarter of 2008, we recognized restructuring and other special
charges of $88.9&nbsp;million. Components of the second-quarter restructuring charge include total
severance costs of $53.5&nbsp;million related to these programs and $35.4&nbsp;million related to exit costs
incurred during the second quarter in connection with previously announced strategic decisions made
in prior periods. Substantially all of these costs were paid by the end of July&nbsp;2008. In
addition, we recognized non-cash charges of $57.1&nbsp;million for the write-down of impaired
manufacturing assets that had no future use, which are included in cost of sales.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2008, we terminated development of our AIR<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> Insulin program, which was being conducted in
collaboration with Alkermes, Inc. The program had been in Phase III clinical development as a
potential treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This decision was not a result of any
observations during AIR Insulin trials relating to the safety of the product, but rather was a
result of increasing uncertainties in the regulatory environment, and a thorough evaluation of the
evolving commercial and clinical potential of the product compared to existing medical therapies.
As a result of this decision, we halted our ongoing clinical studies and transitioned the AIR
Insulin patients in these studies to other appropriate therapies. We have implemented a patient
program in the U.S., and other regions of the world where allowed, to provide clinical trial
participants with appropriate financial support to fund their medications and diagnostic supplies
through the end of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $145.7&nbsp;million in the
first quarter of 2008. These charges were primarily related to the decision to terminate
development of AIR Insulin. Components of these charges included non-cash charges of $40.9&nbsp;million
for the write-down of impaired manufacturing assets that had no use beyond the AIR Insulin program,
as well as charges of $91.7&nbsp;million for estimated contractual obligations and wind-down costs
associated with the termination of clinical trials and certain development activities, and costs
associated with the patient program to transition participants from AIR Insulin. This amount
includes an estimate of Alkermes&#146;s wind-down costs for which we were contractually obligated. The
wind-down activities and patient programs should be substantially complete by the end of 2008. The
remaining component of these charges, $13.1&nbsp;million, is related to exit costs incurred in the first
quarter of 2008 in connection with previously announced strategic decisions made in prior periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with previously announced strategic decisions, we recorded asset impairment,
restructuring, and other special charges of $123.0&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2007. These
charges primarily related to a voluntary severance program at one of our U.S. plants and other
costs related to this action as well as management actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2006.
The component of these charges related to the non-cash asset impairment was $67.6&nbsp;million and was
necessary to adjust the carrying value of the assets to fair value. These restructuring activities
were substantially complete at December&nbsp;31, 2007.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The fair value of the portion of our available-for-sale securities in an unrealized gain
position was
$700.3&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2008, with an unrealized gain of $6.8&nbsp;million. The fair value
of our available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position was $2.06&nbsp;billion, with an
unrealized loss of $147.1&nbsp;million. Substantially all of the securities in a loss position are
investment-grade debt securities and have no indications of deterioration in credit quality.
The majority of these securities first moved into an unrealized loss position during 2008. We
have the intent and ability to hold these securities until the market values recover or the
underlying cash flows have been received, and we have concluded that for those securities in an
unrealized loss position, no other-than-temporary loss exists at September&nbsp;30, 2008. As of September&nbsp;30, 2008, we did not
hold auction rate securities, collateralized debt obligations, or securities issued by
structured investment vehicles.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Note 6: Stock-Based Compensation
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2008 and 2007, our stock-based compensation expense consisted primarily of performance awards
(PAs), shareholder value awards (SVAs), and stock options. We recognized pretax stock-based
compensation cost in the amount of $77.9&nbsp;million and $79.3&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2008 and
2007, respectively. In the first nine months of 2008 and 2007, we recognized stock-based
compensation expense of $192.7&nbsp;million and $214.5&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">PAs are granted to officers and management and are payable in shares of our common stock. The
number of PA shares actually issued, if any, varies depending on the achievement of certain
earnings-per-share targets over a one-year period. PA shares are accounted for at fair value based
upon the closing stock price on the date of grant and fully vest at the end of the fiscal year of
the grant. As of September&nbsp;30, 2008, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">related to nonvested PAs amounted to $47.7&nbsp;million, which will be amortized over the
weighted-average remaining requisite service period of three months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">SVAs are granted to officers and management and are payable in shares of common stock at the end of
a three-year period. The number of shares actually issued varies depending on our stock price at
the end of the three-year vesting period compared to pre-established target prices. We measure the
fair value of the SVA unit on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo
simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the
market condition stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair value of the award. As of
September&nbsp;30, 2008, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested SVAs
amounted to $59.6&nbsp;million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite
service period of 25&nbsp;months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We discontinued issuing stock options beginning in 2007. As of September&nbsp;30, 2008, the total
remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options amounted to $6.7
million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of
four months.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Note 7: Shareholders&#146; Equity
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of September&nbsp;30, 2008, we have purchased $2.58&nbsp;billion of our previously announced $3.0&nbsp;billion
share repurchase program. During the third quarter of 2008, we did not acquire any shares pursuant
to this program, nor do we expect any share repurchases under this program for the remainder of
2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Note 8: Earnings Per Share
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Unless otherwise noted in the footnotes, all per-share amounts are presented on a diluted basis,
that is, based on the weighted-average number of outstanding common shares plus the effect of all
potentially dilutive common shares (primarily unexercised stock options).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Note 9: Income Taxes
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We file income tax returns in the United States (U.S.) federal jurisdiction and various state,
local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or
non-U.S. income tax examinations in major taxing jurisdictions for years before 2002. During the
first quarter of 2008, we completed and effectively settled our Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
audit of tax years 2001-2004 except for one matter for which we will seek resolution through the
IRS administrative appeals process. As a result of the IRS audit conclusion, gross unrecognized
tax benefits were reduced by approximately $618&nbsp;million, and the consolidated results of operations
were benefited by $210.3&nbsp;million through a reduction in income tax expense. The majority of the
reduction in gross unrecognized tax benefits related to intercompany pricing positions that were
agreed with the IRS in a prior audit cycle for which a prepayment of tax was made in 2005.
Application of the prepayment and utilization of tax carryovers resulted in a refund of
approximately $50&nbsp;million. The IRS began its examination of tax years 2005-2007 during the third
quarter of 2008.

    <TD>In Canada, several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have challenged the validity of
our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patent (expiring in 2011). In April&nbsp;2007, the
Canadian Federal Court ruled against the first challenger, Apotex Inc. (Apotex), and that
ruling was affirmed on appeal in February&nbsp;2008. In June&nbsp;2007, the Canadian Federal Court
held that an invalidity allegation of a second challenger, Novopharm Ltd. (Novopharm), was
justified and denied our request that Novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing
approval for generic olanzapine in Canada. Novopharm began selling generic olanzapine in
Canada in the third quarter of 2007. We have sued Novopharm for patent infringement, and
the trial is scheduled for November&nbsp;2008. In November&nbsp;2007, Apotex filed an action seeking
a declaration of the invalidity of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patents, and no
trial date has been set. We have brought similar actions against Pharmascience (August
2007), Sandoz (July&nbsp;2007), Nu-Pharm (June&nbsp;2008), and Genpharm (June&nbsp;2008); none of these
suits has been scheduled for trial. Pharmascience has agreed to be bound by the outcome of

In June&nbsp;2007, the German Federal Patent Court held that our patent is invalid. We are
appealing the decision to the German Supreme Court, which has scheduled a hearing for
December&nbsp;2008. Generic olanzapine was launched by competitors in Germany in the fourth
quarter of 2007. Notwithstanding the Federal Patent Court ruling, we have sought
preliminary injunctions against all generic companies who are marketing generic olanzapine
products in Germany. In May&nbsp;2008 the Court of Appeal in D&#252;sseldorf granted an injunction
against the first of these generic companies, STADApharm GmbH, as a result of which STADA
has had to withdraw its generic olanzapine product from the German market. Preliminary
injunction actions against other generic companies in Germany were denied. We continue to
pursue these companies in main actions for infringement.</TD>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">of two of our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent related to
the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on
past and future sales of these products. On May&nbsp;4, 2006, a jury in Boston issued an initial
decision in the case that Xigris and Evista sales infringe the patent. The jury awarded the
plaintiffs approximately $65&nbsp;million in damages, calculated by applying a
2.3&nbsp;percent royalty to all U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista from the date of issuance of the patent
through the date of trial. In addition, a separate bench trial with the U.S. District Court of
Massachusetts was held in August&nbsp;2006, on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and
impermissibly covers natural processes. In June&nbsp;2005, the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO)&nbsp;commenced a reexamination of the patent, and in August&nbsp;2007 took the position that
the Ariad claims at issue are unpatentable, a position that Ariad continues to contest. In
September&nbsp;2007, the Court entered a final judgment indicating that Ariad&#146;s claims are patentable,
valid, and enforceable, and finding damages in the amount of $65&nbsp;million plus a 2.3&nbsp;percent royalty
on net U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista since the time of the jury decision. However, the Court
deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal have been exhausted.
We have appealed this judgment. We believe that these allegations are without legal merit, that we
will ultimately prevail on these issues, and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages
is remote.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2004, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA)
advised us that it had commenced an investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional
practices, including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants
and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac<sup>&#174;</sup>, and Prozac Weekly&#153;. In November&nbsp;2007, we received a
grand jury subpoena from the EDPA for a broad range of documents related to Zyprexa. In addition,
the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units of more than 30 states are coordinating with the EDPA in its
investigation of any Medicaid-related claims relating to our marketing and promotion of Zyprexa.
Twelve other states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia) have filed lawsuits over Zyprexa and are not
participating in the coordinated investigation. In October&nbsp;2008, we announced that we are in
advanced discussions to resolve the ongoing investigations led by the EDPA, and we recorded a
charge of $1.42&nbsp;billion. The charge reflects our currently estimable exposure with respect to
these matters. If the ongoing discussions are successfully concluded, we expect that they would
settle the Zyprexa-related federal claims, as well as similar Medicaid-related claims of states
participating in the settlement.

Columbia. While there is no finding that we have violated any provision of the state laws under
which the investigations were conducted, we will pay $62&nbsp;million and undertake certain commitments regarding Zyprexa for a period of six years, through
consent decrees filed in the settling states. The 32 states participating in the Multistate
agreement are: Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York,
North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota,

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the
United States and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit.
The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the &#147;claims&#148;) allege a variety of injuries from the use
of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high
blood-glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically
accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the
claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits are
part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL)&nbsp;proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the
Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No.&nbsp;1596). The majority of
non-federal cases are pending in the state court of Indiana.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Since June&nbsp;2005, we have entered into agreements with various claimants&#146; attorneys involved in U.S.
Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims. The
agreements cover a total of approximately 31,350 claimants, including a large number of previously
filed lawsuits and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as follows:

the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to
diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have
been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern District of
New York (EDNY). In these actions, the Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the
costs it paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as well as the costs
the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. We have
been served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia in the
courts of the respective states. The Connecticut, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, and
West Virginia cases are part of the MDL proceedings in
the EDNY. The Alaska case was settled in March&nbsp;2008 for a payment of $15.0&nbsp;million, plus terms
designed to ensure, subject to certain limitations and conditions, that Alaska is treated as
favorably as certain other states that may settle with us in the future over similar claims. The
following cases have been set for trial in 2009: Connecticut in the EDNY in June, Pennsylvania in
November, and South Carolina in August, in their respective states.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the EDNY purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of
all consumers and third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have made or will make
payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now
been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under certain state consumer protection
statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of
Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys&#146; fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed
in the EDNY in 2006 on similar grounds. In September&nbsp;2008, Judge Weinstein certified a class
consisting of third-party payors, excluding governmental entities and individual consumers. We
appealed the certification order, and Judge Weinstein&#146;s order denying our motion for summary
judgment, in September&nbsp;2008. In 2007, The Pennsylvania Employees Trust Fund brought claims in
state court in Pennsylvania as insurer of Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed Zyprexa
on similar grounds as described in the New York cases. As with the product liability suits, these
lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and
improperly promoted the drug. The Pennsylvania case is set for trial in October&nbsp;2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We cannot determine with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be
asserted. The ultimate resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a
material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial
position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits
involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (DES)&nbsp;and thimerosal. The majority of these claims are
covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have reached agreements with claimants&#146; attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability
litigation to settle a total of approximately 31,350 claims against us relating to the
medication. Approximately 1,615 claims remain. As a result of our product liability exposures,
since the beginning of 2005, we have recorded aggregate net pretax charges of $1.61&nbsp;billion for
Zyprexa product liability matters.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2004, we were notified by the U.S. Attorney&#146;s office for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania (EDPA)&nbsp;that it had commenced an investigation relating to our U.S. marketing and
promotional practices for Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weekly. In November&nbsp;2007, we
received a grand jury subpoena from the EDPA requesting documents related to Zyprexa. In October
2008, we announced that we are in advanced discussions to resolve the ongoing investigations led by
the EDPA, and we recorded a charge of $1.42&nbsp;billion. The charge reflects our currently estimable exposure with respect to these matters.
If the ongoing discussions are successfully concluded, we expect that they would settle the
Zyprexa-related federal claims, as well as similar Medicaid-related claims of states participating
in the settlement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Beginning in August&nbsp;2006, we received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys
general of a number of states under various state consumer protection laws seeking Zyprexa
documents. In October&nbsp;2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and the District of Columbia.
While there is no finding that we have violated any provision of the state laws under which the
investigations were conducted, we will pay $62.0&nbsp;million and undertake certain commitments
regarding Zyprexa for a period of six years, through consent decrees filed in the settling states.

House of Representatives and U.S. Senate that would impose additional pricing pressures on our
products, including proposals to legalize the importation of prescription drugs and either allow,
or require, the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices within Medicare
Part&nbsp;D directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Additionally, various proposals have been
introduced that would increase the rebates we pay on sales to Medicaid patients. We expect pricing
pressures at the federal and state levels to continue.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations,
and there are many proposals for additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that
would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Third-quarter and first-nine-months 2008 sales growth of 14&nbsp;percent and 13&nbsp;percent,
respectively, was driven primarily by the collective growth of Cymbalta, Alimta, Cialis,
Humalog, and Gemzar, and by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales in the U.S.
increased by $291.9&nbsp;million, or 12&nbsp;percent, and $704.4&nbsp;million, or 10&nbsp;percent, for the third
quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively, compared with the same periods of 2007.
Sales outside the U.S. increased $330.9&nbsp;million, or 16&nbsp;percent, and $1.02&nbsp;billion, or 17
percent, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively. For the third quarter of 2008, worldwide sales volume, exchange rates, and selling prices contributed 6
percent, 4&nbsp;percent, and 3&nbsp;percent, respectively, to worldwide sales growth (numbers do not add
due to rounding). For the first nine months of 2008,

    <TD>Prior to the acquisition of ICOS in January&nbsp;2007, the Cialis sales shown in the table
above represent results only in the territories in which we marketed Cialis exclusively. The
remaining sales for that one-month period relate to the joint-venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC
(North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint-venture territory
sales, net of expenses and taxes, is reported in other income &#151; net in our consolidated condensed
income statement. Subsequent to the acquisition, all Cialis product sales are included in our net
sales in our consolidated condensed income statement. Cialis sales for the first nine months of
2008 represent 24&nbsp;percent growth over total worldwide sales of $870.3&nbsp;million for the first nine
months of 2007, which includes the joint-venture territory sales.</TD>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Zyprexa, our top-selling product, is a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes
associated with bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance. In the third quarter of 2008,
Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 3&nbsp;percent compared with the third quarter of 2007, driven by
increased net effective selling prices, offset partially by decreased demand. In the first nine
months of 2008, U.S. Zyprexa sales decreased 1&nbsp;percent compared with the same period of 2007
driven by decreased demand, offset partially by increased prices. Sales outside the U.S.
increased 1&nbsp;percent and 4&nbsp;percent during the third quarter and first nine months of 2008,
respectively, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, offset by decreased
demand and decreased prices. Demand outside the U.S. was unfavorably impacted by generic
competition in Canada and Germany, offset by growth in Japan and several European markets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">U.S. sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic
peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and fibromyalgia, increased 34&nbsp;percent
and 28&nbsp;percent during the third quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively, driven
primarily by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Sales outside the U.S.
increased 73&nbsp;percent and 74&nbsp;percent, respectively, driven primarily by increased demand and, to a
lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Increased demand outside the U.S.
reflects both increased demand in established markets, as well as recent launches in new markets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">U.S. sales of Gemzar, a product approved to fight various cancers, increased 14&nbsp;percent and 11
percent during the third quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively, driven by increased
demand and increased prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 10&nbsp;percent and 13&nbsp;percent,
respectively, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">U.S. sales of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased<BR>
13&nbsp;percent and 15&nbsp;percent for the third quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively, driven
by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, increased net effective selling prices. Sales outside
the U.S. increased 28&nbsp;percent and 29&nbsp;percent during both periods, respectively, driven by increased
demand and the favorable impact of exchange rates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total worldwide sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction, increased 21&nbsp;percent and 24
percent during the third quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively. This comparison
includes $72.7&nbsp;million of sales in the Lilly ICOS joint-venture territories for the one-month
period prior to the acquisition of ICOS in January&nbsp;2007. Prior to the ICOS acquisition, Cialis
sales in our territories were reported in revenue, while our 50&nbsp;percent share of the joint-venture
net income was reported in other income &#151; net. Total U.S. sales increased 20&nbsp;percent during the
third quarter of 2008, driven by increased prices and, to a lesser extent, increased demand. For
the first nine months of 2008, U.S. sales increased 20&nbsp;percent, driven by increased demand and, to
a lesser extent, increased prices. Total sales outside the U.S. increased 22&nbsp;percent during the
third quarter of 2008, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and
increased demand. For the first nine months of 2008, sales outside the U.S. increased 26&nbsp;percent,
driven primarily by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

women and for risk reduction of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis
and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, increased 1&nbsp;percent and remained
essentially flat during the third quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively, driven by

high risk for fracture, decreased 6&nbsp;percent during the third quarter of 2008, driven by changes in
wholesaler buying patterns, offset partially by higher net effective selling prices. For the first
nine months of 2008, sales increased 3&nbsp;percent due to increased prices, offset partially by
decreased demand. Forteo sales outside the U.S. grew 36&nbsp;percent and 41&nbsp;percent during the same

slower rate than sales. For the first nine months of 2008, gross margins as a percentage of net
sales decreased by .8&nbsp;percentage points, to 77.1&nbsp;percent. This decrease was primarily due to the

percent, to $4.90&nbsp;billion, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively. This increase
was due to increased marketing and sales force expenses, including prelaunch expenses for
prasugrel and marketing costs associated with Cymbalta and Evista, the impact of foreign exchange
rates, and increased litigation-related expenses. Research and development expenses were $953.0
million and $2.78&nbsp;billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively, or
18&nbsp;percent of sales. Compared with the third quarter and first nine months of 2007, research and
development expenses increased 13&nbsp;percent and 10&nbsp;percent, respectively. This increase was
primarily due to increased discovery research and late-stage clinical trial costs, and for the first nine months
of 2008, to a $47.0&nbsp;million expense for a milestone payment made to MacroGenics, Inc. related to
progress in the clinical trials of teplizumab, offset by lower prasugrel clinical trial costs.
The increase in research and development expenses for the first nine months of 2008 was also
offset by the first-quarter 2007 costs associated with the consequences of the FDA&#146;s rejection of
our appeal of the approvable letter for Arxxant<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">TM</SUP> and the withdrawal of the Arxxant

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of September&nbsp;30, 2008, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $6.12
billion compared with $4.83&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2007. Cash flows from operations of $4.92
billion during the first nine months of 2008 were offset by dividends paid of $1.54&nbsp;billion, net
purchases of property and equipment of $671.5&nbsp;million, and net purchases of noncurrent
investments of $641.9&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total debt at September&nbsp;30, 2008, was $4.61&nbsp;billion, a decrease of $395.1&nbsp;million from December
31, 2007. Subsequent to the announcement of the proposed acquisition of ImClone, Standard &#038;
Poor&#146;s affirmed our AA/A&#043; long-term rating and our A-1 short-term rating. Moody&#146;s Investors
Service placed our Aa3 long-term rating under review for possible downgrade, but affirmed our
Prime-1 short-term rating.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents,
will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital
expenditures, costs associated with litigation and government investigations, dividends, and
taxes in 2008. We approved a definitive merger agreement under which we will acquire ImClone
through an all-cash tender offer of $70 per share, or approximately $6.5&nbsp;billion. We intend to
fund the acquisition, as well as any payments required in connection with the EDPA investigation,
with cash and cash equivalents on hand and short-term borrowings through the issuance of
commercial paper. We have $1.25&nbsp;billion of unused committed bank
credit facilities, $1.2 billion  of
which backs our commercial paper program. Additionally, we have obtained commitments to provide
a short-term revolving credit facility in the amount of $4.0&nbsp;billion as back-up, alternative
financing. Our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected by the recent
illiquidity in the market due to the high credit quality of our short- and long-term debt;
however, long-term borrowing costs have increased. Various risks and uncertainties, including
those discussed in the Financial Expectations for 2008 section, may affect our operating results

approval for generic olanzapine in Canada. Novopharm began selling generic olanzapine in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">of two of our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent related
to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on
past and future sales of these products. On May&nbsp;4, 2006, a jury in Boston issued an initial
decision in the case that Xigris and Evista sales infringe the patent. The jury awarded the
plaintiffs approximately $65&nbsp;million in damages, calculated by applying a 2.3&nbsp;percent royalty to all U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista from the date of issuance of the patent
through the date of trial. In addition, a separate bench trial with the U.S. District Court of
Massachusetts was held in August&nbsp;2006, on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and
impermissibly covers natural processes. In June&nbsp;2005, the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO)&nbsp;commenced a reexamination of the patent, and in August&nbsp;2007 took the position that
the Ariad claims at issue are unpatentable, a position that Ariad continues to contest. In
September&nbsp;2007, the Court entered a final judgment indicating that Ariad&#146;s claims are patentable,
valid, and enforceable, and finding damages in the amount of $65&nbsp;million plus a 2.3&nbsp;percent royalty
on net U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista since the time of the jury decision. However, the Court
deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal have been exhausted.
We have appealed this judgment. We believe that these allegations are without legal merit, that we
will ultimately prevail on these issues, and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages
is remote.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2004, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA)
advised us that it had commenced an investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional
practices, including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants
and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weekly. In November&nbsp;2007, we received a
grand jury subpoena from the EDPA for a broad range of documents related to Zyprexa. In addition,
the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units of more than 30 states are coordinating with the EDPA in its
investigation of any Medicaid-related claims relating to our marketing and promotion of Zyprexa.
Twelve other states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia) have filed lawsuits over Zyprexa and are not
participating in the coordinated investigation. In October&nbsp;2008, we announced that we are in
advanced discussions to resolve the ongoing investigations led by the EDPA, and we recorded a
charge of $1.42&nbsp;billion. The charge reflects our currently estimable exposure with respect to
these matters. If the ongoing discussions are successfully concluded, we expect that they would
settle the Zyprexa-related federal claims, as well as similar Medicaid-related claims of states
participating in the settlement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In October&nbsp;2005, the EDPA advised that it is also conducting an inquiry regarding certain rebate
agreements we entered into with a pharmacy benefit manager covering Axid, Evista, Humalog,
Humulin, Prozac, and Zyprexa. The inquiry includes a review of our Medicaid best price reporting
related to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements.

While there is no finding that we have violated any provision of the state laws under which the
investigations were conducted, we will pay $62&nbsp;million and undertake certain commitments regarding Zyprexa for a period of six years, through
consent decrees filed in the settling states. The 32 states participating in the Multistate
agreement are: Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York,
North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota,

charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies. Except to the extent
described above, we cannot determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount
or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome. It is
possible, however, that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based compliance program that includes
comprehensive compliance-related activities designed to ensure that our marketing and promotional

United States and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit.
The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the &#147;claims&#148;) allege a variety of injuries from the use
of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high
blood-glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically
accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the
claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits are
part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL)&nbsp;proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the
Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No.&nbsp;1596). The majority of
non-federal cases are pending in the state court of Indiana.

the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to
diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have
been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern District of New York (EDNY). In these actions, the Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to
recover the costs it paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as well as
the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses.
We have been served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,
Idaho, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia in
the courts of the respective states. The Connecticut, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico,
and West Virginia cases are part of the MDL proceedings
in the EDNY. The Alaska case was settled in March&nbsp;2008 for a payment of $15.0&nbsp;million, plus terms
designed to ensure, subject to certain limitations and conditions, that Alaska is treated as
favorably as certain other states that may settle with us in the future over similar claims. The
following cases have been set for trial in 2009: Connecticut in the EDNY in June, Pennsylvania in
November, and South Carolina in August, in their respective states.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the EDNY purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of
all consumers and third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have made or will make
payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now
been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under certain state consumer protection
statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of
Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys&#146; fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed
in the EDNY in 2006 on similar grounds. In September&nbsp;2008, Judge Weinstein certified a class
consisting of third-party payors, excluding governmental entities and individual consumers. We
appealed the certification order, and Judge Weinstein&#146;s order denying our motion for summary
judgment, in September&nbsp;2008. In 2007, The Pennsylvania Employees Trust Fund brought claims in
state court in Pennsylvania as insurer of Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed Zyprexa
on similar grounds as described in the New York cases. As with the product liability suits, these
lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and
improperly promoted the drug. The Pennsylvania case is set for trial in October&nbsp;2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We cannot determine with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our full-year 2008 earnings guidance on a GAAP basis is now $2.44 to $2.49 per share. The change
from earlier guidance of $3.79 to $3.94 per share results from the previously mentioned
third-quarter 2008 significant items totaling $1.47 per share that are reflected in our financial
results, as well as from improved financial performance. Our full-year 2008 guidance does not
reflect any impact related to the proposed acquisition of ImClone Systems, Inc., including any
potential charges associated with the purchase.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have
also revised other aspects of our previously-issued 2008 full-year financial guidance.
Specifically, guidance for gross margin as a percent of sales, other income and deductions, and the
effective tax rate has been revised. All other line-item guidance remains unchanged. Sales are
still expected to grow in the high-single to low-double digits. As a result of the weakening of
foreign currencies, we now expect significant improvement in gross margin as a percent of sales, an
increase from prior guidance that gross margin would remain essentially flat. The sum of
marketing, selling, and administrative expenses and research and development expenses is still
expected to grow in the high-single digits. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are
still expected to grow in the high-single digits, and research and development expenses are still
expected to grow in the high-single to low-double digits. Other income and deductions are now
expected to contribute approximately $50&nbsp;million, a reduction from our previous guidance of less
than $100&nbsp;million. As a result of the Zyprexa charges, the effective tax rate is now expected to
be approximately 23&nbsp;percent.

People (NAACP). Under the current schedule, the plaintiffs are to file their class certification
motion in March&nbsp;2009. The company believes this lawsuit is without merit and is prepared to defend
against it vigorously.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">participants face identical lawsuits. The case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of Indiana in August&nbsp;2007. In February&nbsp;2008, the Indianapolis court conditionally certified a
nationwide opt-in collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act of all current and former
employees who served as a Lilly pharmaceutical sales representative at any time from November&nbsp;2003
to the present. As of the close of the opt-in period, fewer than 400 of the over 7,500 potential
plaintiffs elected to participate in the lawsuit. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and are
prepared to defend against it vigorously.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>ImClone Shareholder Litigation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In October&nbsp;2008, a class action complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
purportedly on behalf of all shareholders of ImClone Systems, Inc. (ImClone), against us, ImClone,
and the members of its board of directors. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the
members of ImClone&#146;s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to ImClone&#146;s shareholders
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and failed to provide
ImClone&#146;s shareholders with material information to make an informed decision as to whether to
tender their shares in the offer. In addition, the complaint alleges that Lilly knowingly aided
and abetted the alleged wrongdoing of ImClone&#146;s board of directors. The complaint seeks, among
other relief, injunctive relief preliminarily and permanently enjoining the defendants from
proceeding with the offer; a judgment enjoining the defendants from consummating the offer and the
merger until certain additional information is provided; and an award to plaintiffs of the costs of
the action, including reasonable attorneys&#146; and experts&#146; fees. We believe that the complaint is
without merit and intend to vigorously defend the action.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Matters</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2004 we, along with several other pharmaceutical companies, were named in one consolidated
case in California state court brought on behalf of consumers alleging that the conduct of
pharmaceutical companies in preventing commercial importation of prescription drugs from outside
the United States violated antitrust laws. The case sought restitution for alleged overpayments for
pharmaceuticals and an injunction against the allegedly violative conduct. Summary judgment was
granted to us and the other defendants. In July&nbsp;2008, the California Court of Appeals affirmed
that decision. Plaintiffs have petitioned the California Supreme Court to accept a further appeal.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the patent, product liability, or
other legal actions brought against us or the ultimate cost of environmental matters, we believe
that, except as noted above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to the
consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period.
