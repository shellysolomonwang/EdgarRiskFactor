</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have prepared the accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements in
accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and, therefore, they do not include all information
and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).
In our opinion, the financial statements reflect all adjustments (including those that are normal
and recurring) that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the
periods shown. In preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, we must make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and
related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. Certain reclassifications have been made to the
December&nbsp;31, 2008 consolidated condensed financial statements to conform with the March&nbsp;31, 2009
presentation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Note 2: Implementation of New Financial Accounting Pronouncements
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)&nbsp;Statement No.&nbsp;141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)),
is effective for us for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January
1, 2009. SFAS 141(R) changes how the acquisition method is applied in accordance with SFAS 141.
The primary revisions to this Statement require an acquirer in a business combination to measure
assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the
acquisition date, at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions specified in the
Statement. This Statement also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages
 to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values (or other amounts determined in
accordance with the Statement). Assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contractual
contingencies as of the acquisition date are to be measured at their acquisition-date fair values,
and assets or liabilities arising from all other contingencies as of the acquisition date are to be
measured at their acquisition-date fair value, only if it is more likely than not that they meet
the definition of an asset or a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No.&nbsp;6, Elements of Financial
Statements. This Statement significantly amends other Statements and authoritative guidance,
including FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;4, Applicability of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;2 to Business Combinations
Accounted for by the Purchase Method, and now requires the capitalization of research and
development assets acquired in a business combination at their acquisition-date fair values,
separately from goodwill. FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109, Accounting for Income Taxes, was also amended by
this Statement to require the acquirer to recognize changes in the amount of its deferred tax
benefits that are recognizable because of a business combination either in income from continuing
operations in the period of the combination or directly in contributed capital, depending on the
circumstances.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;160, Accounting for Noncontrolling Interests (SFAS
160), on January&nbsp;1, 2009. This Statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No.&nbsp;51, Consolidated
Financial Statements (ARB 51), by requiring companies to report a noncontrolling interest in a
subsidiary as equity in its consolidated financial statements. Disclosure of the amounts of
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest will be
required. This Statement also clarifies that transactions that result in a change in a parent&#146;s
ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation will be treated as equity
transactions, while a gain or loss will be recognized by the parent when a subsidiary is
deconsolidated. We now classify our noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary as equity in our
consolidated condensed statements of financial position at March&nbsp;31, 2009 and retroactively

noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary for the first quarters of 2009 and 2008 is not material
and has not been separately disclosed in the consolidated condensed statements of income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;133 (SFAS 161), on January&nbsp;1, 2009. SFAS
161 applies to all derivative instruments and related hedged items accounted for under FASB
Statement No.&nbsp;133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities (SFAS 133). This
Statement requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses
derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under
SFAS 133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items
affect an entity&#146;s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. These disclosures
are included in Note 6.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We adopted the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)&nbsp;Issue No.&nbsp;07-1,
Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements (EITF 07-1), on January&nbsp;1, 2009. EITF 07-1 defines collaborative
arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a
collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties. This
Issue has been applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for all significant
collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date by classifying revenues into two
separate components: net product sales and collaboration and other revenue. See Note 4 for
additional information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We adopted the provisions of FASB Staff Position 115-2, Recognition and Presentation
of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments (FSP 115-2), on January&nbsp;1, 2009. FSP 115-2 amends the
other-than-temporary recognition guidance for debt securities and requires additional interim and
annual disclosures of other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity securities. Pursuant to
the new guidance, an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred if a company does not expect to
recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. In this situation, if the company does
not intend to sell the impaired security, and it is not more likely than not it will be required
to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amount of the
other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings is limited to the portion attributed to the
credit loss. The remaining portion of the other-than-temporary impairment is then recorded in
other comprehensive income. This FSP has been applied to existing and new securities as of
January&nbsp;1, 2009. The applicable disclosures are included in Note 6. The implementation of this
FSP was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations and there was
no cumulative effect adjustment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We adopted the provisions of FASB Staff Position 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the
Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and
Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (FSP 157-4), as of March&nbsp;31, 2009. FSP 157-4 provides additional
guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability
have significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity. The FSP also provides
additional guidance on circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly and
requires additional disclosures. The implementation of this FSP was not material to our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We adopted the provisions of FASB Staff Position 107-1, Disclosures About Fair Value
of Financial Instruments (FSP 107-1), as of March&nbsp;31, 2009. FSP 107-1 requires disclosures about fair value
of all financial instruments for interim reporting periods. The applicable disclosures are
included in Note 6. The implementation of this FSP was not material to our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

</DIV>

estimated fair value required management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The excess
of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, has been
recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of these acquisitions are included in our
consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Most of these acquisitions included in-process research and development (IPR&#038;D), which represented
compounds, new indications, or line extensions under development that had not yet achieved
regulatory approval for marketing. There are several methods that can be used to determine the
estimated fair value of the IPR&#038;D acquired in a business combination. We utilized the &#147;income
method,&#148; which applies a probability weighting to the estimated future net cash flows that are
derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs. These projections are based on factors
such as relevant market size, patent protection, historical pricing of similar products, and
expected industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present
value using an appropriate discount rate. This analysis is performed for each project
independently. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;4, Applicability of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;2
to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, these acquired IPR&#038;D intangible
assets totaling $4.71&nbsp;billion in 2008 were expensed immediately subsequent to the acquisition
because the products had no alternative future use. None of these charges were incurred during the
first quarter of 2008. The ongoing activities with respect to each of these products in
development are not material to our research and development expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition to the acquisitions of businesses, we also acquired several products in development.
The acquired IPR&#038;D related to these products of $122.0&nbsp;million in 2008, including $87.0&nbsp;million in
the first quarter of 2008, was also written off by a charge to income immediately upon acquisition
because the products had no alternative future use.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;24, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of ImClone Systems Inc.
(ImClone), a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing oncology care, for a total purchase
price of approximately $6.5&nbsp;billion, which was financed through borrowings. This strategic
combination will offer both targeted therapies and oncolytic agents along with a pipeline
spanning all phases of clinical development. The combination also expands our biotechnology
capabilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under the purchase method of
accounting, resulting in goodwill of $419.5&nbsp;million. No portion of this goodwill is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are currently determining the fair values of a few of these net assets. The purchase price has
been preliminarily allocated based on an estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The final determination of these fair values
will be completed as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date.
Although the final determination may result in asset and liability fair values that are different
than the preliminary estimates of these amounts included herein, it is not expected that those
differences will be material to our consolidated financial results.

in development, including $1.33&nbsp;billion to line extensions for Erbitux. A significant portion (81
percent) of the remaining value of acquired IPR&#038;D is attributable to one compound in Phase III
clinical testing and two compounds in Phase II clinical testing, all targeted to treat various
forms of cancers. The discount rate we used in valuing the acquired IPR&#038;D projects was 13.5

as the product&#146;s supporting operations, from Monsanto Company (Monsanto). The acquisition of
Posilac provides us with a product that complements those of our animal health business. Under the
terms of the agreement, we acquired the rights to the Posilac brand, as well as the product&#146;s U.S.
sales force and manufacturing facility, for an aggregate purchase price of $403.9&nbsp;million, which
includes a $300.0&nbsp;million upfront payment, transaction costs, and an accrual for contingent
consideration to Monsanto based on estimated future Posilac sales for which payment is considered
likely beyond a reasonable doubt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">This acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under the purchase method of
accounting. We allocated $204.3&nbsp;million to identifiable intangible assets related to Posilac,
$167.6&nbsp;million to inventories, and $99.5&nbsp;million of the purchase price to property and equipment.
We also assumed $67.5&nbsp;million of liabilities. Substantially all of the identifiable intangible
assets are being amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives of 20&nbsp;years. The amount
allocated to each of the intangible assets acquired is deductible for tax purposes.

(TransPharma) to acquire rights to its product and related drug delivery system for the treatment
of osteoporosis. The product, which is administered transdermally using TransPharma&#146;s proprietary
technology, was in Phase II clinical testing, and had no alternative future use. Under the
arrangement, we also gained non-exclusive access to TransPharma&#146;s ViaDerm drug delivery system for
the product. As with many development-phase products, launch of the product, if approved, was not
expected in the near term. The charge of $35.0&nbsp;million for acquired IPR&#038;D related to this
arrangement was included as expense in the second quarter of 2008 and was deductible for tax
purposes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In January&nbsp;2008, our agreement with BioMS Medical Corp. to acquire the rights to its compound for
the treatment of multiple sclerosis became effective. At the inception of this agreement, this
compound was in the development stage (Phase III clinical trials) and had no alternative future
use. As with many development-phase compounds, launch of the product, if approved, was not
expected in the near term. The charge of $87.0&nbsp;million for acquired IPR&#038;D related to this

expense reimbursements or payments to the third party. Revenues related to products sold by us
pursuant to these arrangements are included in net product sales, while other sources of revenue
(e.g., royalties and profit share payments) are included in collaboration and other revenue.
Operating expenses for costs incurred pursuant to these arrangements are reported in their

to expire in 2018, upon which all of the rights with respect to Erbitux in the U.S. and Canada
return to us. In the first quarter of 2009, we recognized total revenue of $94.1&nbsp;million for

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are in a collaborative arrangement with Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (D-S) to develop,
market, and promote prasugrel, an antiplatelet agent for the treatment of patients with acute
coronary syndromes (ACS)&nbsp;who are being managed with an artery-opening procedure known as
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Prasugrel was approved for marketing by the European
Commission under the tradename Efient<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> in February&nbsp;2009, and the initial sales were recorded in the
first quarter of 2009. We have submitted a New Drug Application (NDA)&nbsp;to the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)&nbsp;and are currently awaiting its decision. Within this arrangement, we have
agreed to co-promote under the same trademark in certain territories (including the U.S. and five
major European markets), while we have exclusive marketing rights in certain other territories. D-S
has exclusive marketing rights in Japan. Under the agreement, we paid D-S an upfront license fee
and agreed to pay future success milestones. Both parties share in the costs of the development and
marketing in the co-promotion territories. D-S is responsible for supplying bulk product, but we
will produce the finished product for our exclusive and co-promotion territories. Profits in the
U.S. and other co-promotion territories will be shared according to the agreement. In our exclusive
territories, we will pay D-S a royalty specific to those territories. Profit share payments made to
D-S are recorded as marketing, selling, and administrative expenses. All royalties paid to D-S will
be recorded in cost of sales.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2008, we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of TPG-Axon Capital (TPG)&nbsp;for the Phase III
development of our gamma-secretase inhibitor and our A-beta antibody, our two lead molecules for
the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer&#146;s disease. Under the agreement, both we and TPG will
provide funding for the Alzheimer&#146;s clinical trials. Funding from TPG will not exceed $325&nbsp;million
and could extend into 2014. In exchange for their funding, TPG may receive success-based milestones
totaling $330&nbsp;million and mid- to high-single digit royalties that are contingent upon the
successful development of the Alzheimer&#146;s treatments. The royalties will be paid for approximately
eight years after launch of a product. Reimbursements received from TPG for its portion of research
and development costs incurred related to the Alzheimer&#146;s treatments are recorded as a reduction to
the research and development expense line item on the consolidated condensed statements of income.
The reimbursement from TPG is not expected to be material in any period.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The components of the charges included in asset impairments, restructuring, and other special
charges in our consolidated condensed statements of income are described below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2008, we terminated development of our AIR<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> Insulin program, which was being conducted in
collaboration with Alkermes, Inc. The program had been in Phase III clinical development as a
potential treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This decision was not a result of any
observations during AIR Insulin trials relating to the safety of the product, but rather was a
result of increasing uncertainties in the regulatory environment, and a thorough evaluation of the
evolving commercial and clinical potential of the product compared to existing medical therapies.
As a result of this decision, we halted our ongoing clinical studies and transitioned the AIR
Insulin patients in these studies to other appropriate therapies. We implemented a patient program
in the U.S., and other regions of the world where allowed, to provide clinical trial participants
with appropriate financial support to fund their medications and diagnostic supplies through the
end of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $145.7&nbsp;million in the
first quarter of 2008. These charges were primarily related to the decision to terminate
development of AIR Insulin. Components of these charges included non-cash charges of $40.9&nbsp;million
for the write down of impaired manufacturing assets that had no use beyond the AIR Insulin program,
as well as charges of $91.7&nbsp;million for estimated contractual obligations and wind-down costs
associated with the termination of clinical trials and certain development activities, and costs
associated with the patient program to transition participants from AIR Insulin. This amount
included an estimate of Alkermes&#146; wind-down costs for which we were contractually obligated. The
wind-down activities and patient programs were substantially complete by the end of 2008. The
remaining component of these charges, $13.1&nbsp;million, is related to exit costs incurred in the first
quarter of 2008 in connection with previously announced strategic decisions made in prior periods.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of trade
receivables and interest-bearing investments. Wholesale distributors of life-sciences products account for a substantial portion of trade receivables; collateral is
generally not required. The risk associated with this concentration is mitigated by our ongoing
credit review procedures and insurance. Major financial institutions
represent the largest component of our investments in corporate debt
securities. In accordance with documented corporate policies, we limit the

credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to risk-management
instruments but do not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given their high
credit ratings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Accounting Policy for Risk-Management Instruments
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our derivative activities are initiated within the guidelines of documented corporate
risk-management policies and do not create additional risk because gains and losses on derivative
contracts offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. As
derivative contracts are initiated, we designate the instruments individually as either a fair
value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Management reviews the correlation and effectiveness of our
derivatives on a quarterly basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the derivative
instrument is marked to market with gains and losses recognized currently in income to offset the
respective losses and gains recognized on the underlying exposure. For derivative contracts that
are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of gains and losses on these
contracts is reported as a component of other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in
the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness is immediately
recognized in earnings. Derivative contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments are
recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized currently in earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We may
enter into foreign currency forward and purchase option contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating
currency exchange rates (principally the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen).
Foreign currency derivatives used for hedging are put in place using the same or like currencies
and duration as the underlying exposures. Forward contracts are principally used to manage
exposures arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign
currencies. These contracts are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in
other<I>&#151;</I>net, expense (income). The purchased option contracts are used to hedge anticipated foreign
currency transactions, primarily intercompany inventory activities expected to occur within the
next year. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of those future transactions, and
the impact on earnings is included in cost of sales. We may enter into foreign currency forward
contracts and currency swaps as fair value hedges of firm
commitments. Forward and purchase option
contracts generally have maturities not exceeding 12&nbsp;months. At March&nbsp;31, 2009, we did not hold any
foreign currency option contracts. At March&nbsp;31, 2009, we had outstanding foreign currency forward
commitments to purchase 244&nbsp;million British pounds and sell 264&nbsp;million euro, and
commitments to purchase 758&nbsp;million U.S. dollars and sell 581&nbsp;million euro, which will settle within 30&nbsp;days.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.
These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion
of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative
financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact of
fluctuations in interest rates on earnings. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from
changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures,
we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt and investment
positions and may enter into interest rate swaps or collars to help maintain that balance.
Interest rate swaps or collars that convert our fixed-rate debt or investments to a floating rate
are designated as fair value hedges of the underlying instruments. Interest rate swaps or collars
that convert floating rate debt or investments to a fixed rate are designated as cash flow hedges.
Interest expense on the debt is adjusted to include the payments made or received under the swap
agreements. At March&nbsp;31, 2009, approximately 78&nbsp;percent of our total debt is at a fixed rate. We
have converted approximately 34&nbsp;percent of our fixed-rate debt to floating rates through the use of
interest rate swaps.

$17.9&nbsp;million, of which $12.6&nbsp;million was recognized in other comprehensive loss resulting in a
net charge of $5.3&nbsp;million, which relates to credit losses on certain mortgage-backed
securities. The amount of credit losses represents the difference between the present value of
cash flows expected to be collected on these securities and the amortized cost. Factors
considered in assessing the credit loss were the position in the capital structure, vintage and
amount of collateral, delinquency rates, current credit support, and geographic concentration.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The securities in an unrealized loss position are comprised of fixed-rate debt securities of
varying maturities. The value of fixed income securities is sensitive to changes in the yield
curve and other market conditions, which led to the decline in value. Approximately 80&nbsp;percent
of the securities in a loss position are investment-grade debt securities. The majority of
these securities first moved into an unrealized loss position during 2008. At this time, there
is no indication of default on interest or principal payments for debt securities other than
those for which an other-than-temporary impairment charge has been recorded. We do not intend
to sell and it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell the securities in a loss
position</DIV>

obligations were determined using Level 3 inputs. We did not hold securities issued by

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2009 and 2008, our stock-based compensation expense consists primarily of performance awards
(PAs) and shareholder value awards (SVAs). We recognized pretax stock-based compensation cost of
$66.1&nbsp;million and $58.5&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">PAs are granted to officers and management and are payable in shares of our common stock. The
number of PA shares actually issued, if any, varies depending on the achievement of certain
earnings-per share targets over a one-year and a two-year period. PA shares are accounted for at
fair value based upon the closing stock price on the date of grant and fully vest at the end of the
measurement periods. As of March&nbsp;31, 2009, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost
related to nonvested PAs amounted to $211.8&nbsp;million, which will be amortized over the
weighted-average remaining requisite service period of approximately 14&nbsp;months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">SVAs are granted to officers and management and are payable in shares of common stock at the end of
a three-year period. The number of shares actually issued varies depending on our stock price at
the end of the three-year vesting period compared to pre-established target prices. We measure the
fair value of the SVA unit on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo
simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the
market condition stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair value of the award. As of
March&nbsp;31, 2009, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested SVAs
amounted to $81.6&nbsp;million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite
service period of approximately 27&nbsp;months.

share repurchase program. During the first quarter of 2009, we did not acquire any shares pursuant
to this program, nor do we expect any share repurchases under this program for the remainder of
2009. In the first quarter of 2009, we contributed an additional 10&nbsp;million shares to the employee
benefit trust, which resulted in a reclassification within equity from additional-paid-in capital
of $371.9&nbsp;million and common stock of $6.3&nbsp;million to the employee benefit trust of $378.2&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">income tax examinations in major taxing jurisdictions for years before 2002. During the
first quarter of 2008, we completed and effectively settled our Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
audit of tax years 2001-2004 except for one matter for which we will seek resolution through the
IRS administrative appeals process. As a result of the IRS audit conclusion, gross unrecognized
tax benefits were reduced by approximately $618&nbsp;million, and the consolidated results of operations
were benefited by $210.3&nbsp;million through a reduction in income tax expense. The majority of the
reduction in gross unrecognized tax benefits related to intercompany pricing positions that were
agreed with the IRS in a prior audit cycle for which a prepayment of tax was made in 2005.
Application of the prepayment and utilization of tax carryovers resulted in a refund of
approximately $50&nbsp;million. The IRS began its examination of tax years 2005-2007 during the third
quarter of 2008. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized
tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12&nbsp;months.

    <TD>In Canada, several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have challenged the validity of
our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patent (expiring in 2011). In April&nbsp;2007, the
Canadian Federal Court ruled against the first challenger, Apotex Inc. (Apotex), and that
ruling was affirmed on appeal in February&nbsp;2008. In June&nbsp;2007, the Canadian Federal Court
held that an invalidity allegation of a second challenger, Novopharm Ltd. (Novopharm), was
justified and denied our request that Novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing
approval for generic olanzapine in Canada. Novopharm began selling generic olanzapine in
Canada in the third quarter of 2007. We sued Novopharm for patent infringement, and the
trial was completed in April&nbsp;2009. We anticipate a decision in the second half of 2009. In
November&nbsp;2007, Apotex filed an action seeking a declaration of the invalidity of our Zyprexa
compound and method-of-use patents, and no trial date has been set.
We are involved in similar
actions against Pharmascience (August&nbsp;2007), Sandoz (July&nbsp;2007), Nu-Pharm (June&nbsp;2008),
Genpharm (June&nbsp;2008) and Cobalt (January&nbsp;2009). By agreement

In June&nbsp;2007, the German Federal Patent Court held that our patent is invalid. Generic
olanzapine was launched by competitors in Germany in the fourth quarter of 2007. We
appealed the decision to the German Federal Supreme Court and following a hearing in
December&nbsp;2008, the Supreme Court reversed the Federal Patent Court and found the patent to

of Technology, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the President and Fellows of
Harvard College in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts sued us, alleging that
sales of two of our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent related
to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on
past and future sales of these products. Following jury and bench trials on separate issues, the
U.S. District Court of Massachusetts entered final judgment in September&nbsp;2007 that Ariad&#146;s claims
were valid, infringed, and enforceable, and finding damages in the amount of $65&nbsp;million plus a 2.3
percent royalty on net U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista since the time of the jury decision.
However, the Court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal are
exhausted. In April&nbsp;2009, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned the District
Court judgment, concluding that Ariad&#146;s asserted patent claims are invalid. While Ariad may
request the Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision, or the United States Supreme Court to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2004, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA)
advised us that it had commenced an investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional
practices, including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants
and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac&#174;, and Prozac Weekly&#153;. In addition, the State
Medicaid Fraud Control Units of more than 30 states coordinated with the EDPA in its investigation
of any Medicaid-related claims relating to our marketing and promotion of Zyprexa. In January
2009, we announced that we reached resolution of this matter, and on January&nbsp;30, 2009, the court
approved the settlement. As part of the resolution, we pled guilty to one misdemeanor violation of
the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the off-label promotion of Zyprexa in elderly populations as
treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer&#146;s dementia, between September&nbsp;1999 and March&nbsp;2001. In
connection with the federal criminal and civil settlements, in the first quarter of 2009, we paid
$1.06&nbsp;billion. We also agreed to make available a maximum amount of approximately $362.0&nbsp;million
for payment to those states that agree to settle. We recorded a charge of $1.42&nbsp;billion for this
matter in the third quarter of 2008. As part of the settlement, we have entered into a corporate
integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG)&nbsp;of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), which requires us to maintain our compliance program and to undertake a set
of defined corporate integrity obligations for five years. The agreement also provides for an
independent third-party review organization to assess and report on the company&#146;s systems,
processes, policies, procedures, and practices.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2006, we received a subpoena from the California Attorney General&#146;s Office seeking
production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain Zyprexa&#146;s status on
California&#146;s formulary, marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa, and
remuneration of health care providers. We expect this matter to be resolved if California
participates in the state component of the EDPA resolution.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In
October&nbsp;2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and the District of Columbia related to a
multistate investigation brought under various state consumer protection laws. While there is no
finding that we have violated any provision of the state laws under which the investigations were
conducted, we accrued and paid $62.0&nbsp;million and agreed to undertake certain commitments regarding
Zyprexa for a period of six years, through consent decrees filed with the settling states.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the
U.S. and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit. The
lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the &#147;claims&#148;) allege a variety of injuries from the use of
Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high
blood-glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically
accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the
claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits are
part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL)&nbsp;proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the
Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No.&nbsp;1596).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Since June&nbsp;2005, we have entered into agreements with various claimants&#146; attorneys involved in U.S.
Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims. The
agreements cover a total of approximately 32,670 claimants, including a large number of previously
filed lawsuits and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in all remaining claims. The U.S.
Zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 120 lawsuits
in the U.S. covering approximately 140 plaintiffs, of which about 90 cases covering about 100
plaintiffs are part of the MDL. No trials have been scheduled related to these claims.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2004, we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in Louisiana on behalf of
the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to
diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have
been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern District of
New York (EDNY). In these actions, the Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the
costs it paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as well as the costs
the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. We have
been served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia
in the courts of the respective states. The Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Montana, New Mexico, and West Virginia cases are part of the MDL proceedings in the EDNY. The
Alaska case was settled in March&nbsp;2008 for a payment of $15.0&nbsp;million, plus terms designed to
ensure, subject to certain limitations and conditions, that Alaska is treated as favorably as
certain other states that may settle with us in the future over similar claims. The following
cases have been set for trial: Connecticut in the EDNY in November&nbsp;2009, and South Carolina in
September&nbsp;2009 and Pennsylvania in April&nbsp;2010, both in their respective states.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the EDNY purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of
all consumers and third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have made or will make
payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now
been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under certain state consumer protection
statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of
Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys&#146; fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed
in the EDNY in 2006 on similar grounds. In September&nbsp;2008, Judge Weinstein certified a class
consisting of third-party payors, excluding governmental entities and individual consumers. We
appealed the
certification order, and Judge Weinstein&#146;s order denying our motion for summary judgment, in
September&nbsp;2008. In 2007, The Pennsylvania Employees Trust Fund brought claims in state court in
Pennsylvania as insurer of Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed Zyprexa on similar
grounds as described in the New York cases. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits
allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly
promoted the drug. The Pennsylvania case is set for trial in June&nbsp;2009.

covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to
large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future. In the
past few years, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a
very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed
products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self-insured for future
product liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect
from our insurance carriers in the future.

measures have been discussed and/or passed in both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S.
Senate that would impose additional pricing pressures on our products, including proposals to
legalize the importation of prescription drugs and either allow, or require, the Secretary of
Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices within Medicare Part&nbsp;D directly with
pharmaceutical manufacturers. Additionally, various proposals have been introduced that would
increase the rebates we pay on sales to Medicaid patients or impose additional rebates on sales to
patients who receive their medicines through Medicare Part&nbsp;D or other government programs.
Further, proposals to expand coverage to the uninsured could include some form of price rebates or
tax on the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, many U.S. states are facing substantial budget
difficulties due to the downturn in the economy and are expected to seek aggressive cuts or other
offsets in healthcare spending. We expect pricing pressures at the federal and state levels to
become more severe, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In its preliminary budget submission to Congress, the new administration proposed
changes to the manner in which the U.S. would tax the international
income of U.S.-based companies. While it is uncertain how the U.S. Congress
may address this issue, reform of U.S. taxation of international
income continues to be a topic of discussion for the U.S. legislature.
A significant change to the U.S. tax system that would change the taxation of international income could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, the federal government is considering creating a regulatory pathway for biosimilars
(copies)&nbsp;for the majority of biologic products in the U.S.; the proposals vary as to which biologic
products would be eligible, how quickly a biosimilar might reach the market, and the ability to
interchange the biosimilar and the original biologic product at the pharmacy.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations,
and there are many proposals for additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that
would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls, limit
access to reimbursement for our products, or reduce the value of our
intellectual property protection.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>Revenue</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenue increased 5&nbsp;percent, to $5.05&nbsp;billion, driven primarily by the increase in net product
sales related to the collective growth of Cymbalta, Alimta, and Humulog, and the increase in
collaboration and other revenue due to the inclusion of Erbitux revenue as a result of the
ImClone acquisition. Revenue in the U.S.
increased by $325.3&nbsp;million, or 13&nbsp;percent, for the first quarter of 2009 compared with the
first quarter of 2008. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased $85.9&nbsp;million, or 4&nbsp;percent, for the
first quarter of 2009 due to the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Worldwide volume
increased 7&nbsp;percent, while selling prices contributed 3&nbsp;percent of sales growth, partially
offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 6&nbsp;percent (numbers do not add due
to rounding).

Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 7&nbsp;percent compared with the first quarter of 2008, driven by
higher prices and the favorable impact of wholesaler buying patterns, partially offset by
decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 5&nbsp;percent, driven by the unfavorable impact
of foreign

points, to 83.8&nbsp;percent. This increase was due to the impact on international inventories from the
decline in foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a benefit to cost of sales.

administrative expenses) increased 2&nbsp;percent for the first quarter of 2009 compared with the first
quarter of 2008. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses declined 1&nbsp;percent to $1.53
billion, due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and a reduction in expenses related to U.S.
marketing programs, partially offset by the impact of the ImClone acquisition and increased
prasugrel pre-launch activities. Research and development expenses increased 8&nbsp;percent to $947.3

discovery research costs, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchanges rates.

due to lower interest income and higher interest expense associated with the ImClone acquisition,
as well as lower business development income.

million due to the recognition of $210.3&nbsp;million discrete benefit as a result of the resolution of a
substantial portion of the IRS audit of our federal income tax returns for years 2001 through 2004.

compared with $5.93&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2008. The decrease in cash is driven by a net
reduction in short-term borrowings of $4.24&nbsp;billion and dividends paid of $536.8&nbsp;million,
partially offset by proceeds of long-term debt issuances of $2.40&nbsp;billion. Cash flow from
operations was $87.9&nbsp;million, which included payments related to the EDPA settlement of $1.06
billion.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total debt as of March&nbsp;31, 2009 decreased by $1.99&nbsp;billion, to $8.47&nbsp;billion, reflecting the pay
down of our commercial paper that was issued to finance our acquisition of
ImClone and to fund payments required in connection with the EDPA settlements, partially offset
by $2.40&nbsp;billion of long-
term debt we issued in March&nbsp;2009. Our current debt ratings from Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s and Moody&#146;s
remain at AA and A1, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the past several months, global economic conditions have deteriorated, triggered by the
liquidity crisis in the capital markets, resulting in higher unemployment and declines in real
consumer spending. In addition, many financial institutions tightened lines of credit, reducing
funding available for near-term economic growth. Pharmaceutical consumption has traditionally
been relatively unaffected by economic downturns; however, an extended downturn could lead to a

near-term impact of prescription trends, the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other
customers and suppliers, the decline of health insurance coverage in the overall population, and
the federal government&#146;s involvement in the economic crisis.

will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital
expenditures, costs associated with litigation and government investigations, and dividends in
2009. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be
adequate to fund short-term borrowings. Our access to credit markets has not been adversely
affected by the illiquidity in the market because of the high credit quality of our short- and
long-term debt. In the remainder of 2009, we intend to fund the remaining payments required in
connection with the EDPA settlements, and to further reduce outstanding commercial paper with
cash and cash equivalents on hand, and cash generated from operations. We currently have $1.24
billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20&nbsp;billion of which backs our commercial
paper program. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in the Financial

of Technology, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the President and Fellows of
Harvard College in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts sued us, alleging that
sales of two of our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent related
to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on
past and future sales of these products. Following jury and bench trials on separate issues, the
U.S. District Court of Massachusetts entered final judgment in September&nbsp;2007 that Ariad&#146;s claims
were valid, infringed, and enforceable, and finding damages in the amount of $65&nbsp;million plus a 2.3
percent royalty on net U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista since the time of the jury decision.
However, the Court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal are
exhausted. In April&nbsp;2009, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned the District
Court judgment, concluding that Ariad&#146;s asserted patent claims are invalid. While Ariad may
request the Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision, or the United States Supreme Court to
consider the matter, we believe that these allegations are without legal merit, that we will
ultimately prevail on these issues, and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is
remote.

advised us that it had commenced an investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional
practices, including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants
and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weekly. In addition, the State
Medicaid Fraud Control Units of more than 30 states coordinated with the EDPA in its investigation
of any Medicaid-related claims relating to our marketing and promotion of Zyprexa. In January
2009, we announced that we reached resolution of this matter, and on January&nbsp;30, 2009, the court
approved the settlement. As part of the resolution, we pled guilty to one misdemeanor violation of
the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the off-label promotion of Zyprexa in elderly populations as
treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer&#146;s dementia, between September&nbsp;1999 and March&nbsp;2001. In

matter in the third quarter of 2008. As part of the settlement, we have entered into a corporate
integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG)&nbsp;of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), which requires us to maintain our compliance program and to undertake a set
of defined corporate integrity obligations for five years. The agreement also provides for an
independent third-party review organization to assess and report on the company&#146;s systems,
processes, policies, procedures, and practices.

production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain Zyprexa&#146;s status on
California&#146;s formulary, marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa, and
remuneration of health care providers. We expect this matter to be resolved if California
participates in the state component of the EDPA resolution.

multistate investigation brought under various state consumer protection laws. While there is no
finding that we have violated any provision of the state laws under which the investigations were

Zyprexa for a period of six years, through consent decrees filed with the settling states.

U.S. and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit. The
lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the &#147;claims&#148;) allege a variety of injuries from the use of
Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high
blood-glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically
accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the
claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits are
part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL)&nbsp;proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the
Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No.&nbsp;1596).

the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to
diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have
been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern District of
New York (EDNY). In these actions, the Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the
costs it paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as well as the costs
the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. We have
been served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia
in the courts of the respective states. The Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Montana, New Mexico, and West Virginia cases are part of the MDL proceedings in the EDNY. The
Alaska case was settled in March&nbsp;2008 for a payment of $15.0&nbsp;million, plus terms designed to
ensure, subject to certain limitations and conditions, that Alaska is treated as favorably as
certain other states that may settle with us in the future over similar claims. The following
cases have been set for trial: Connecticut in the EDNY in November&nbsp;2009, and South Carolina in
September&nbsp;2009 and Pennsylvania in April&nbsp;2010, both in their respective states.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the EDNY purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of
all consumers and third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have made or will make
payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now
been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under certain state consumer protection
statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of
Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys&#146; fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed
in the EDNY in 2006 on similar grounds. In September&nbsp;2008, Judge Weinstein certified a class
consisting of third-party payors, excluding governmental entities and individual consumers. We
appealed the certification order, and Judge Weinstein&#146;s order denying our motion for summary
judgment, in September&nbsp;2008. In 2007, The Pennsylvania Employees Trust Fund brought claims in
state court in Pennsylvania as insurer of Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed Zyprexa
on similar grounds as described in the New York cases. As with the product liability suits, these
lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and
improperly promoted the drug. The Pennsylvania case is set for trial
in June&nbsp;2009.

large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future. In the
past few years, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market.
Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that
we will continue to be completely self-insured for future product liability losses. In addition,
there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The amounts presented in columns (a)&nbsp;and (b)&nbsp;above represent purchases of common stock related to
our stock-based compensation programs. The amounts presented in columns (c)&nbsp;and (d)&nbsp;in the above
table represent activity related to our $3.0&nbsp;billion share repurchase program announced in March
2000. As of March&nbsp;31, 2009, we have purchased $2.58&nbsp;billion related to this program. During the
first three months of 2009, no shares were repurchased pursuant to this program and
we do not expect to purchase any shares under this program during the remainder of 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On February&nbsp;10, 2009, the company issued and sold 10&nbsp;million shares of its common stock to National
City Bank, not in its individual or corporate capacity, but solely in its capacity as Trustee of
the Eli Lilly Compensation Trust (the &#147;Trust&#148;). The Trust is an employee benefit trust that
provides a source of funds to assist the company in meeting its obligations under various employee
compensation and benefit plans. The shares were sold in exchange for a promissory note from the
Trustee in its capacity as Trustee of the Trust in the aggregate principal amount of $378.2&nbsp;million
(the&#147;Note&#148;). The Note bears interest at 2&nbsp;percent above the prime rate of interest charged by
JPMorgan Chase bank, and is compounded annually. The Note is repayable on the earliest of (i)
demand by the company, (ii)&nbsp;early termination of the Trust, or (iii)&nbsp;April&nbsp;17, 2025, the final
termination date of the Trust.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">This funding of the Trust had no net impact on shareholders&#146; equity as we consolidate the Trust.
Any dividends paid on the shares in the Trust are used to repay indebtedness under the Note and are
therefore eliminated. Lilly common stock held by the Trust is not considered outstanding in the
computation of earnings per share. The sale of common stock was exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 by virtue of the exemption provided by Section&nbsp;4(2) as a
transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering.
