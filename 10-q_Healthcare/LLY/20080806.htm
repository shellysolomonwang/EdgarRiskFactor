products for purposes of segment reporting. Our business segments are distinguished by the
ultimate end user of the product: humans or animals. Performance is evaluated based on profit or
loss from operations before income taxes. Income before income taxes for the animal health
business for the second quarter of 2008 and 2007 was $28.4&nbsp;million and $29.3&nbsp;million, respectively,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Note 1: Basis of Presentation
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have prepared the accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements in
accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and, therefore, they do not include all information
and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).
In our opinion, the financial statements reflect all adjustments (including those that are normal
and recurring) that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the
periods shown. In preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, we must make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and
related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Note 2: Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the second quarter of 2008, we determined that our methodology for calculating our return
reserve for future product returns in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
No.&nbsp;48 (SFAS 48), Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, needed to be corrected. Using
the revised methodology, our return reserve was understated by $247.5&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2007,
2006 and 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We performed an evaluation to determine if the errors resulting in the return reserve liability
calculated using the revised methodology were material to any individual prior period, taking into
account the requirements of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)&nbsp;Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current
Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). Based on this analysis, we concluded that while the
cumulative error was material to the current and prior-year financial statements, the correction of
the error would not be material to any individual period and, therefore, as provided for by SAB
108, the correction of the error does not require previously filed reports to be amended and the
correction may be made the next time we file our prior period financial statements. We restated
the 2007 balance sheet included in this filing. Financial statements for the years ended December
31, 2006 and 2007 will be restated no later than the filing of the December&nbsp;31, 2008 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The tables below present the effect of the financial statement adjustments related to the
restatement of our previously reported financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007,
2006 and 2005. The statements of income were not adjusted for any of the years or quarters because we
concluded that the amount of the adjustment calculated using the revised methodology was not material
in any period. The amount of the annual adjustment for 2005, 2006, or 2007 would have been $.01
per share or less. The aggregate statement of income impact from December&nbsp;31, 2004 to December&nbsp;31,
2007 would have been an additional expense of approximately $35&nbsp;million on a pretax basis
(approximately $23&nbsp;million net of tax). Approximately $8&nbsp;million of benefit on a pretax basis
(approximately $5&nbsp;million net of tax), recognized in the second quarter as a result of a reduction
in the return reserve, was related to the first quarter of 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)&nbsp;Statement No.&nbsp;157 (SFAS
157), Fair Value Measurements, on January&nbsp;1, 2008. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
The implementation of this Statement was not material to our consolidated financial position or
results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued Statement No.&nbsp;161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 applies to all
derivative instruments and related hedged items accounted for under FASB Statement No.&nbsp;133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This Statement requires entities to
provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how
derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its
related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity&#146;s
financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. This Statement is effective for us
January&nbsp;1, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB revised and issued Statement No.&nbsp;141, Business Combinations (SFAS
141(R)). SFAS 141(R) changes how the acquisition method is applied in accordance with SFAS 141.
The primary revisions to this Statement require an acquirer in a business combination to measure
assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the
acquisition date, at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions specified in the
Statement. This Statement also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages
to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest in the
acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values (or other amounts determined in accordance with
the Statement). Assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies as
of the acquisition date are to be measured at their acquisition-date fair values, and assets or
liabilities arising from all other contingencies as of the acquisition date are to be measured at
their acquisition-date fair value, only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition
of an asset or a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No.&nbsp;6, Elements of Financial Statements.
This Statement significantly amends other Statements and authoritative guidance, including FASB
Interpretation No.&nbsp;4, Applicability of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;2 to Business Combinations Accounted for
by the Purchase Method, and now requires the capitalization of research and development assets
acquired in a business combination at their acquisition-date fair values, separately from goodwill.
SFAS No.&nbsp;109, Accounting for Income Taxes, was also amended by this Statement to require the
acquirer to recognize changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable
because of a business combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of the
combination or directly in contributed capital, depending on the circumstances. This Statement is
effective for us for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January&nbsp;1,
2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, in conjunction with SFAS 141(R), the FASB issued Statement No.&nbsp;160, Accounting
for Noncontrolling Interests. This Statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No.&nbsp;51,
Consolidated Financial Statements (ARB 51), by requiring companies to report a noncontrolling
interest in a subsidiary as equity in its consolidated financial statements. Disclosure of the
amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest will
be required. This Statement also clarifies that transactions that result in a change in a parent&#146;s
ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation will be treated as equity
transactions, while a gain or loss will be recognized by the parent when a subsidiary is
deconsolidated. This Statement is effective for us January&nbsp;1, 2009, and we do not anticipate the

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Acquisition

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On July&nbsp;8, 2008, we entered into a definitive merger
agreement to acquire all of the outstanding
common stock of SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SGX), a collaboration partner since 2003. The
acquisition allows us to integrate SGX&#146;s structure-guided drug discovery platform into our drug
discovery efforts. It also gives us access to FAST<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">TM</SUP>, SGX&#146;s fragment-based, protein
structure guided drug discovery technology, and to a portfolio of preclinical oncology compounds
focused on a number of kinase targets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Under the terms of the agreement, the
outstanding shares of SGX common stock would be redeemed for
an aggregate purchase price of approximately $64&nbsp;million in cash. Consummation of the acquisition
is expected in the second half of 2008 and is subject to approval of SGX shareholders, clearance
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and certain
other closing conditions. If the transaction closes in 2008, we expect to incur a one-time charge to earnings for
acquired in-process research and development (IPR&#038;D), but it is premature to estimate what that
charge will be.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">ICOS Corporation Acquisition
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;29, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of ICOS Corporation (ICOS),
our partner in the Lilly ICOS LLC joint venture for the manufacture and sale of Cialis<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> for the
treatment of erectile dysfunction. The acquisition brings the full value of Cialis to us and
enables us to realize operational efficiencies in the further development, marketing, and selling
of this product. Under the terms of the agreement, each outstanding share of ICOS common stock was
redeemed for $34 in cash for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.3&nbsp;billion, which was
financed through borrowings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under the purchase method of
accounting. Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
from ICOS are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in our
consolidated financial statements. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
acquired net assets has been recorded as goodwill in the amount of $646.7&nbsp;million. No portion of
this goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. ICOS&#146;s results of operations are
included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have determined the following estimated fair values for the assets purchased and liabilities
assumed as of the date of acquisition. The determination of estimated fair value required
management to make significant estimates and assumptions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The acquired IPR&#038;D represented compounds under development that had not yet achieved regulatory
approval for marketing. New indications for and formulations of the Cialis compound in clinical
testing at the time of the acquisition represented approximately 48&nbsp;percent of the estimated fair
value of the IPR&#038;D. The remaining value of IPR&#038;D represents several other products in development,
with no one asset comprising a significant portion of this value. In accordance with FIN 4,
Applicability of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase
Method, these IPR&#038;D intangible assets totaling $303.5&nbsp;million have been written off by a charge to
income immediately subsequent to the acquisition because the compounds do not have any alternative
future use. This charge is not deductible for tax purposes. The ongoing activity with respect to
each of these compounds under development is not material to our research and development expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There are several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair value of the acquired
IPR&#038;D. We utilized the &#147;income method,&#148; which applies a probability weighting to the estimated
future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs. These
projections are based on factors such as relevant market size, patent protection, historical
pricing of similar products, and expected industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are
then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. This analysis is
performed for each project independently. The discount rate we used in valuing the acquired IPR&#038;D
projects was 20&nbsp;percent.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Other Acquisitions
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the second quarter of 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of both Hypnion, Inc.
(Hypnion), a privately held neuroscience drug discovery company focused on sleep disorders, and Ivy
Animal Health, Inc. (Ivy), a privately held applied research and pharmaceutical product development
company focused on the animal health industry, for $445.0&nbsp;million in cash. The ongoing activities
with respect to these companies&#146; products in development are not material to our research and
development expenses. The results of operations are included in our consolidated condensed
financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The acquisition of Hypnion provides us with a broader and more substantive presence in the area of
sleep disorder research and ownership of HY10275, a novel Phase II compound with a dual mechanism
of action aimed at promoting better sleep onset and sleep maintenance. This was Hypnion&#146;s only
significant asset. For this acquisition, we recorded a charge of $291.1&nbsp;million, representing the
estimated fair value of the acquired compound, to acquired IPR&#038;D in the second quarter of 2007
because the development-stage compound acquired did not have any alternative future use. This
charge was not deductible for tax purposes. Because Hypnion was a development-stage company, the
transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than as a business combination
and, therefore, goodwill was not recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The acquisition of Ivy provides us with products that complement those of our animal health product
line. This acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under the purchase method
of accounting. We have allocated $88.7&nbsp;million of the purchase price to other identifiable
intangible assets, primarily related to marketed products, $37.0&nbsp;million to acquired IPR&#038;D, and
$25.0&nbsp;million to goodwill. The IPR&#038;D represents products in development that are not yet approved
for marketing and have no alternative future use. Accordingly, the $37.0&nbsp;million allocated to
acquired IPR&#038;D was expensed immediately subsequent to the acquisition. The other identifiable
intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives of 10 to 20&nbsp;years.
Goodwill resulting from this acquisition has been fully allocated to the animal health business
segment. The amount allocated to each of the intangible assets acquired, including goodwill, is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

(TransPharma) to acquire rights to its product and related drug delivery system for the treatment
of osteoporosis. The product, which is administered transdermally using
TransPharma&#146;s proprietary technology, is currently in Phase II clinical testing, and has no
alternative future use. Under the arrangement, we also gain non-exclusive access to TransPharma&#146;s
ViaDerm drug delivery system for the product. As with many development-phase products, launch of
the product, if approved, is not expected in the near term. The charge of $35.0 million
for acquired IPR&#038;D related
to this arrangement was included as expense in the second quarter of 2008 and
is deductible for tax purposes.

clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Anti-Trust Improvements Act in January&nbsp;2008. At the
inception of this agreement, this compound was in the development stage (Phase III clinical trials)
and had no alternative future use. As with many development-phase compounds, launch of the
product, if approved, was not expected in the near term. The charge of $87.0 million
for acquired IPR&#038;D related to
this arrangement was included as expense in the first quarter of 2008 and is
deductible for tax purposes.

both we and TPG will provide funding for the Alzheimer&#146;s clinical trials. Funding from TPG will not
exceed $325&nbsp;million and could extend into 2014. In exchange for their funding, TPG may receive
success-based milestones totaling $330&nbsp;million and mid- to high- single digit royalties that are
contingent upon the successful development of the Alzheimer&#146;s treatments. The royalties will be
paid for approximately eight years after launch of a product. Our reported research and

recognized restructuring and other special
charges of $88.9&nbsp;million. In addition, we recognized non-cash charges of $57.1&nbsp;million for the
write-down of impaired manufacturing assets that had no future use, which are included in cost of
sales. In April&nbsp;2008, we announced a voluntary exit program that was offered to employees
primarily in manufacturing. Components of the second-quarter restructuring charge include total
severance costs of $53.5&nbsp;million related to these programs and $35.4&nbsp;million related to exit costs
incurred during the second quarter in connection with previously announced strategic decisions made

potential treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This decision was not a result of any
observations during AIR Insulin trials relating to the safety of the product, but rather was a
result of increasing uncertainties in the regulatory environment, and a thorough evaluation of the
evolving commercial and clinical potential of the product compared to existing medical therapies.
As a result of this decision, we halted our ongoing clinical studies and are transitioning
the AIR Insulin patients in these studies to other appropriate therapies. We have implemented a
patient program in the U.S., and other regions of the world where allowed, to provide clinical
trial participants with appropriate financial support to fund their medications and diagnostic
supplies through the end of 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $145.7&nbsp;million in the
first quarter of 2008. These charges are primarily related to the decision to terminate
development of AIR Insulin. Components of these charges include non-cash charges of $40.9&nbsp;million
for the write-down of impaired manufacturing assets that had no use beyond the AIR Insulin program,
as well as charges of $91.7&nbsp;million for estimated contractual obligations and wind-down costs
associated with the termination of clinical trials and certain development activities, and costs
associated with the patient program to transition participants from AIR Insulin. This amount
includes an estimate of Alkermes&#146; wind-down costs for which we are contractually obligated. The
wind-down activities and patient programs should be substantially complete by the end of 2008. The
remaining component of these charges, $13.1&nbsp;million, is related to exit costs incurred in the first
quarter of 2008 in connection with previously announced strategic decisions made in prior periods.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with previously announced strategic decisions, we recorded asset impairment,
restructuring, and other special charges of $123.0&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2007. These
charges primarily related to a voluntary severance program at one of our U.S. plants and other
costs related to this action as well as management actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2006.
The component of these charges related to the non-cash asset impairment was $67.6&nbsp;million, and was
necessary to adjust the carrying value of the assets to fair value. These restructuring activities
were substantially complete at December&nbsp;31, 2007.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The fair
value of the portion of our available-for-sale
securities in an unrealized gain position was $1.33 billion at June 30, 2008, with an unrealized
gain of $9.8 million. The fair value of our available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position
was $1.94 billion, with an unrealized loss of $78.9 million. Substantially
all of the securities in a loss position are investment-grade debt securities and have no
indications of deterioration in credit quality. The majority of these securities first moved
into an unrealized loss position during the first quarter of 2008. We have the intent and
ability to hold these securities until the market values recover or the underlying cash flows
have been received and we have concluded that no other-than-temporary loss exists at June&nbsp;30,
2008. We did not hold auction rate securities, collateralized debt obligations, or securities
issued by structured investment vehicles at June&nbsp;30, 2008.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2008 and 2007, our stock-based compensation expense consisted primarily of performance awards
(PAs), shareholder value awards (SVAs), and stock options. We recognized pretax stock-based
compensation cost in the amount of $56.3&nbsp;million and $62.5&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2008
and 2007, respectively. In the first half of 2008 and 2007, we recognized stock-based compensation
expense of $114.8&nbsp;million and $135.2&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">PAs are granted to officers and management and are payable in shares of our common stock. The
number of PA shares actually issued, if any, varies depending on the achievement of certain
earnings-per share targets over a one-year period. PA shares are accounted for at fair value based
upon the closing stock price on the date of grant and fully vest at the end of the fiscal year of
the grant. As of June&nbsp;30, 2008, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">related to
nonvested PAs amounted to $80.8&nbsp;million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average
remaining requisite service period of six months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">SVAs are granted to officers and management and are payable in shares of common stock at the end of
a three-year period. The number of shares actually issued varies depending on our stock price at
the end of the three-year vesting period compared to pre-established target prices. We measure the
fair value of the SVA unit on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo
simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the
market condition stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair value of the award. As of
June&nbsp;30, 2008, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested SVAs
amounted to $68.9&nbsp;million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite
service period of 27&nbsp;months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We discontinued issuing stock options beginning in 2007. As of June&nbsp;30, 2008, the total remaining
unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options amounted to $11.5&nbsp;million, which
will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of seven months.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of June&nbsp;30, 2008, we have purchased $2.58&nbsp;billion of our previously announced $3.0&nbsp;billion share
repurchase program. During the first half of 2008, we did not acquire any shares pursuant to this
program, nor do we expect any share repurchases under this program for the remainder of 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Note 9: Earnings Per Share
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Unless otherwise noted in the footnotes, all per-share amounts are presented on a diluted basis,
that is, based on the weighted-average number of outstanding common shares plus the effect of all
potentially dilutive common shares (primarily unexercised stock options).

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We file income tax returns in the United States (U.S.) federal jurisdiction and various state,
local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or
non-U.S. income tax examinations in major taxing jurisdictions for years before 2002. During the
first quarter of 2008, we completed and effectively settled our Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
audit of tax years 2001-2004 except for one matter for which we will seek resolution through the
IRS administrative appeals process. As a result of the IRS audit conclusion, gross unrecognized
tax benefits were reduced by approximately $618&nbsp;million, and the consolidated results of operations
were benefited by $210.3&nbsp;million through a reduction in income tax expense. The majority of the
reduction in gross unrecognized tax benefits related to intercompany pricing positions that were
agreed with the IRS in a prior audit cycle for which a prepayment of tax was made in 2005.
Application of the prepayment and utilization of tax carryovers resulted in a refund of
approximately $50&nbsp;million. We expect the IRS to begin examination of tax years 2005-2007 during
the third quarter of 2008.

Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) has also submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market a
generic version of Evista. In June&nbsp;2006, we filed a similar lawsuit against Teva in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The lawsuit against Teva is
currently scheduled for trial beginning March&nbsp;9, 2009, while no trial date has been set in
the lawsuit against Barr. In April&nbsp;2008, the FDA granted Teva tentative approval of its
ANDA, but Teva&#146;s ability to market a generic product before a decision at trial is subject to
expiration of a current statutory stay and our right to seek an extension of that stay on
final FDA approval of Teva&#146;s ANDA or a preliminary injunction barring marketing by Teva of
any approved generic product. We believe that Barr&#146;s and Teva&#146;s claims are without merit and

Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun) each submitted ANDAs seeking permission to market generic
versions of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (compound patent
expiring in 2010 and method of use patent expiring in 2013), and alleging that these patents
are invalid. We filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Indiana against Sicor (February&nbsp;2006) and Mayne (October&nbsp;2006 and January&nbsp;2008), seeking
rulings that these patents are valid and are being infringed. The suit against Sicor has been
scheduled for trial in July&nbsp;2009. The statutory stay barring final approval of Sicor&#146;s ANDAs
has expired; however, Sicor must provide 90&nbsp;days notice prior to marketing generic Gemzar upon
receipt of final approval by the FDA to allow time for us to seek a preliminary injunction.
Both suits against Mayne have been administratively closed, and the parties have agreed to be
bound by the results of the Sicor suit. In November&nbsp;2007, Sun filed a declaratory judgment
action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, seeking
rulings that our method-of-use and compound patents are invalid or unenforceable, or would not
be infringed by the sale of Sun&#146;s generic product. This trial is scheduled for December&nbsp;2009.
We expect to prevail in this litigation and believe that these claims are without merit.

a permanent injunction. In June&nbsp;2008, Glenmark agreed to entry of a permanent injunction,
enjoining it from selling a generic product prior to the expiration of the U.S. patent.
Also in June&nbsp;2008, Synthon notified us that it has withdrawn its ANDA and agreed to a

our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patent (expiring in 2011). In April&nbsp;2007, the
Canadian Federal Court ruled against the first challenger, Apotex Inc. (Apotex), and that
ruling was affirmed on appeal in February&nbsp;2008. In June&nbsp;2007, the Canadian Federal Court
held that an invalidity allegation of a second challenger, Novopharm Ltd. (Novopharm), was
justified and denied our request that Novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing
approval for generic olanzapine in Canada. Novopharm began selling generic olanzapine in
Canada in the third quarter of 2007. We have sued Novopharm for patent infringement, and
the trial is scheduled for November&nbsp;2008. In November&nbsp;2007, Apotex filed an action seeking
a declaration of the invalidity of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patents, and no
trial date has been set. We have brought similar actions against Pharmascience (August
2007), Sandoz (July&nbsp;2007), Nu-Pharm (June&nbsp;2008), and Genpharm (June&nbsp;2008); none of these
suits has been scheduled for trial. Pharmascience has agreed to be bound by the outcome of
the Novopharm suit, and, pending the outcome of the lawsuit, we have agreed not to take any
further steps to prevent them from coming to market with generic olanzapine tablets, subject
to a contingent damages obligation should we be successful against Novopharm.</TD>

    <TD>In Germany, generic pharmaceutical manufacturers Egis-Gyogyszergyar and Neolab Ltd.
challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patent (expiring in 2011).
In June&nbsp;2007, the German Federal Patent Court held that our patent is invalid. We are
appealing the decision. Generic olanzapine was launched by competitors in Germany in the
fourth quarter of 2007. Notwithstanding the Federal Patent Court ruling, we have sought
preliminary injunctions against all generic companies who are marketing generic olanzapine
products in Germany. In May&nbsp;2008 the Court of Appeal in D&#252;sseldorf granted an injunction
against the first of these generic companies, STADApharm GmbH, as a result of which STADA
has had to withdraw its generic olanzapine product from the German market. Preliminary
injunction actions are pending in the District Court in D&#252;sseldorf against eighteen other
generic companies in Germany. The first of these, against Sandoz GmbH, was heard by the
Court in July&nbsp;2008.</TD>

challenge, but we anticipate further legal challenges from generic manufacturers. In the
U.K., the generic pharmaceutical manufacturer Dr.&nbsp;Reddy&#146;s Laboratories (UK)&nbsp;Limited has
challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patent (expiring in 2011).
This case was heard in July&nbsp;2008 before the Patents Court in the High Court, London. We

Technology, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the President and Fellows of
Harvard College in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts sued us, alleging that
sales of two of our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent related
to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on
past and future sales of these products. On May&nbsp;4, 2006, a jury in Boston issued an initial
decision in the case that Xigris and Evista sales infringe the patent. The jury awarded the
plaintiffs approximately $65&nbsp;million in damages, calculated by applying a 2.3&nbsp;percent royalty to
all U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista from the date of issuance of the patent through the date of
trial. In addition, a separate bench trial with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts was held
in August&nbsp;2006, on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural
processes. In June&nbsp;2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)&nbsp;commenced a
reexamination of the patent, and in August&nbsp;2007 took the position that the Ariad

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">claims at issue
are unpatentable, a position that Ariad continues to contest. In September&nbsp;2007, the Court entered
a final judgment indicating that Ariad&#146;s claims are patentable, valid, and enforceable, and finding
damages in the amount of $65&nbsp;million plus a 2.3&nbsp;percent royalty on net U.S. sales of Xigris and
Evista since the time of the jury decision. However, the Court deferred the requirement to pay any
damages until after all rights to appeal have been exhausted. We have appealed this judgment. We
believe that these allegations are without legal merit, that we will ultimately prevail on these
issues, and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote.

United States and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit.
The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the &#147;claims&#148;) allege a variety of injuries from the use
of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high
blood-glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically
accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the
claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits are
part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL)&nbsp;proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the
Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No.&nbsp;1596). The majority of

class actions on behalf of all consumers and third-party payors, excluding governmental entities,
which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed
Zyprexa. These actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under
certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law
theories, seeking a refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys&#146;
fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New York in 2006 on similar
grounds. In July&nbsp;2008, Judge Weinstein circulated a discussion draft opinion indicating that he
will likely certify a class consisting of third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, and
that he will likely not certify a class of individual consumers. The draft opinion indicates that
the decision would be immediately appealable. We disagree that such a class can be appropriately
certified and intend to appeal this point, should Judge Weinstein certify such a class. In 2007,
The Pennsylvania Employees Trust Fund brought claims in state court in Pennsylvania as insurer of
Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed Zyprexa on similar grounds as described in the
New York cases. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we inadequately
tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to
large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future. In the
past few years, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a
very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed
products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be
completely self-insured for future
product liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect
from our insurance carriers on past claims.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August 5, 2008, we entered into an
agreement to sell most of our Greenfield, Indiana site to Covance, Inc. (Covance).
This site currently houses our preclinical toxicology group and our animal health division,
Elanco, as well as other, smaller business groups.  As part of this agreement, Covance will
purchase the site and continue certain operations there.
Covance currently provides toxicology and early-phase clinical services to us,
and as part of this arrangement we have entered into a ten-year service agreement
expanding the scope of our existing relationship.  We plan to relocate Elanco&#146;s operations to a new site.
This arrangement is subject to
certain closing conditions, including completion of due diligence and
clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
Covance will take possession of the Greenfield site upon closing, which we anticipate
will occur later this year.  In addition, on August&nbsp;5, 2008, we signed agreements with Quintiles, Inc.
(Quintiles) for clinical trial monitoring services and with Ingenix
Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., doing business as i3 Statprobe (i3), for clinical data management services.  The Quintiles and i3 agreements
will become effective later this year.  All of these agreements are part of our ongoing
transformation into a more flexible organization.  We expect to incur asset impairment and
severance charges in connection with these arrangements which will likely be significant;
however, we are unable to estimate the amount of the charges at this time.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Second-quarter and first-half 2008 sales growth of 11&nbsp;percent and 12&nbsp;percent, respectively, was
driven primarily by the collective growth of Cymbalta, Cialis, Humalog, Alimta, and Gemzar, and
by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales in the U.S. increased by $176.9
million, or 7&nbsp;percent, and $412.5&nbsp;million, or 9&nbsp;percent, for the second quarter and first half
of 2008, respectively, compared with the same periods of 2007. Sales outside the U.S.
increased $342.6&nbsp;million, or 16&nbsp;percent, and $688.4&nbsp;million, or 17&nbsp;percent, for the second
quarter and first half of 2008, respectively. For the second quarter, exchange rates
contributed 6&nbsp;percent of worldwide sales growth, while sales volume increased 5&nbsp;percent.
Changes in selling prices did not impact overall sales growth. For the first six months of
2008, worldwide sales volume, exchange rates, and selling prices contributed 6&nbsp;percent, 5
percent, and 1&nbsp;percent, respectively, to worldwide sales growth.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Zyprexa, our top-selling product, is a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes
associated with bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance. In the second quarter of 2008,
Zyprexa sales in the U.S. were essentially flat as the impact from changes in both net selling
prices and volume was negligible. In the first half of 2008, U.S. Zyprexa sales decreased 2
percent compared with the same period of 2007 due primarily to decreased demand. Sales outside
the U.S. increased 4&nbsp;percent and 5&nbsp;percent for the second quarter and first half of 2008,
respectively, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, offset by decreased
prices and decreased demand. Demand outside the U.S. was unfavorably impacted by generic
competition in Canada and Germany, offset by growth in Japan and several European markets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">U.S. sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic
peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and fibromyalgia, increased 19&nbsp;percent
and 25&nbsp;percent during the second quarter and first half of 2008, respectively, driven primarily by
increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 80&nbsp;percent and 75&nbsp;percent compared to the same
periods in 2007, driven primarily by increased demand in established markets as well as recent
launches in new markets. The increase was also attributable, to a lesser extent, to the favorable
impact of foreign exchange rates and increased prices.

acquisition of ICOS. Prior to the ICOS acquisition, Cialis sales in our territories were reported
in revenue, while our 50&nbsp;percent share of the joint-venture net income was reported in other income
&#151; net. Total U.S. sales increased 17&nbsp;percent and 20&nbsp;percent during the second quarter and first
half of 2008 due to increased prices and demand. Total sales outside the U.S. increased 28&nbsp;percent
during both the second quarter and first half of 2008, respectively, due primarily to increased

quarter and first half of 2008, respectively, driven by increased demand, the 2007 acquisition of
Ivy Animal Health, Inc., and the 2007 launch of Comfortis<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">TM</SUP>, a new companion animal
product that kills fleas and prevents flea infestations on dogs. Sales outside the U.S increased 16&nbsp;percent and 10&nbsp;percent, compared to the same periods
in 2007, driven primarily by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For the second quarter of 2008, gross margins as a percent of net sales decreased by 1.7&nbsp;percentage
points, to 76.7&nbsp;percent. For the first half of 2008, gross margins as a percentage of net sales
decreased by 1.5&nbsp;percentage points, to 76.8&nbsp;percent. This decrease was primarily due to the impact
of foreign exchange rates and the inclusion in cost of sales of asset impairments at certain
manufacturing facilities of $57.1&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2008, partially offset by
manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Marketing, selling and administrative expenses rose 12&nbsp;percent, to $1.70&nbsp;billion, and 14&nbsp;percent,
to $3.25&nbsp;billion for the second quarter and first half of 2008, respectively. This increase was
due to the impact of foreign exchange rates, increased marketing expenses (including those for
Evista&#146;s new indication for invasive breast cancer risk reduction, marketing costs associated
with Cymbalta, and prelaunch expenses for prasugrel), increased litigation-related expenses
(including the Alaska settlement in the first quarter of 2008), and the impact of the 2007 ICOS
acquisition. Research and development expenses were
$951.5&nbsp;million and $1.83&nbsp;billion for the
second quarter and first half of 2008, respectively, or 18&nbsp;percent of sales. Compared with the
second quarter and first half of 2007, research and development expenses increased 11&nbsp;percent and
8&nbsp;percent, respectively. This increase was primarily due to a $47.0&nbsp;million expense for a
milestone payment made to MacroGenics, Inc. related to progress in the clinical trials of
teplizumab, increased discovery research and late-stage clinical trial costs, offset by lower
prasugrel clinical trial costs. The increase in research and development expenses for the first
half of 2008 was also offset by the first-quarter 2007 costs associated with the consequences of
the FDA&#146;s rejection of our appeal of the approvable letter for Arxxant<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">TM</SUP> and the
withdrawal of the Arxxant application in Europe.

recognized a discrete income tax benefit of $210.3&nbsp;million, which was a result of the resolution of
a substantial portion of the IRS audit of our federal income tax returns for the years 2001 through

compared with $4.83&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2007. Cash
flows from operations of $2.78&nbsp;billion

of noncurrent investments of $504.5&nbsp;million, and net purchases of property and equipment of
$450.6&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total debt at June&nbsp;30, 2008, was $4.61&nbsp;billion, a decrease of $393.4&nbsp;million from December&nbsp;31,

understated by $247.5&nbsp;million, which resulted in a restatement of our consolidated condensed

We believe that amounts available through our existing commercial paper program should be
adequate to fund maturities of short-term borrowings, if necessary. We currently have $1.25

June&nbsp;2002, Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the President and Fellows

of
Harvard College in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts sued us,

alleging that
sales of two of our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent

related
to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body, and seeking

royalties on
past and future sales of these products. On May&nbsp;4, 2006, a jury in Boston issued an

initial
decision in the case that Xigris and Evista sales infringe the patent. The jury awarded the
plaintiffs approximately $65&nbsp;million in damages, calculated by applying a

2.3&nbsp;percent royalty to
all U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista from the date of issuance of the patent through the date

of
trial. In addition, a separate bench trial with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts was

held
in August&nbsp;2006, on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and impermissibly

covers natural
processes. In June&nbsp;2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office

(USPTO)&nbsp;commenced a
reexamination of the patent, and in August&nbsp;2007 took the position that the Ariad claims

at issue
are unpatentable, a position that Ariad continues to contest. In September&nbsp;2007, the

Court entered
a final judgment indicating that Ariad&#146;s claims are patentable, valid, and enforceable,

and finding
damages in the amount of $65&nbsp;million plus a 2.3&nbsp;percent royalty on net U.S. sales

of Xigris and
Evista since the time of the jury decision. However, the Court deferred the requirement to

pay any
damages until after all rights to appeal have been exhausted. We have appealed this

judgment. We
believe that these allegations are without legal merit, that we will ultimately prevail on

these
issues, and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2006, we

received a subpoena from the California Attorney General&#146;s Office seeking
production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain Zyprexa&#146;s status

on
California&#146;s formulary, marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa,

and
remuneration of health care providers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2007, we

received a subpoena from the Office of the Attorney General of the State of

our
marketing and promotional practices, including our communications with physicians and

remuneration
of physician consultants and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Beginning in August&nbsp;2006, we

have received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the
attorneys general of a number of states under various state consumer protection laws. Most

of
these requests are now part of a multistate investigative effort being coordinated by an

executive
committee of attorneys general. We are aware that more than 30 states are participating in

this
joint effort, and it is possible that additional states will join the investigation. These
attorneys general are seeking a broad range of Zyprexa documents, including documents

relating to
sales, marketing and promotional practices, and remuneration of health care providers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are cooperating in each of

these investigations, including providing a broad range of documents
and information relating to the investigations. It is possible that other Lilly products

could
become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal
charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies. We cannot determine

the
outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines

or
penalties that might result from an adverse outcome. It is possible, however, that an

adverse
outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,

liquidity,
and financial position. We have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly

based
compliance program that includes comprehensive compliance-related activities designed to

ensure
that our marketing and promotional practices, physician communications, remuneration of

health care
professionals, managed care arrangements, and Medicaid best price reporting comply with

applicable

Litigation
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have been named as a defendant

in a large number of Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the
United States and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed

suit.
The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the &#147;claims&#148;) allege a variety of

injuries from the use
of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or

high
blood-glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and

typically
accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the
claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits

are
part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL)&nbsp;proceeding before The Honorable Jack

Weinstein in the
Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No.&nbsp;1596). The

majority of
non-federal cases are pending in the state court of Indiana.

entered into agreements with various claimants&#146; attorneys involved in
U.S.&nbsp;Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are prepared to continue our

vigorous defense of Zyprexa in all remaining claims. The U.S.
Zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 185

lawsuits
in the U.S. covering approximately 1,185 plaintiffs, of which about 140 cases covering about

315
plaintiffs are part of the MDL. No trial dates are currently set for the product liability

cases.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In early 2005, we were served

with four lawsuits seeking class action status in Canada on behalf of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2004, we were

served with two lawsuits brought in state court in Louisiana on behalf of
the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or

contributed to
diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. These cases

have
been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern

District of
New York. In these actions, the Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the

costs it
paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as well as the costs the
department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. We

have been
served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho,

Mississippi,
Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia in the courts of

the
respective states. The Connecticut, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, and West Virginia

cases have
been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern

District of
New York. The Alaska case was settled in March&nbsp;2008 for a payment of

$15.0&nbsp;million, plus terms
designed to ensure, subject to certain limitations and conditions, that Alaska is treated as
favorably as certain other states that may settle with Lilly in the future over similar

claims. The Pennsylvania and South Carolina cases have been scheduled for trial in August 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2005, two lawsuits were filed

in the Eastern District of New York purporting to be nationwide
class actions on behalf of all consumers and third-party payors, excluding governmental

entities,
which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed
Zyprexa. These actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought

under
certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law
theories, seeking a refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and

attorneys&#146;
fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New York in 2006 on

similar
grounds. In July&nbsp;2008, Judge Weinstein circulated a discussion draft opinion indicating

that he
will likely certify a class consisting of third-party payors, excluding governmental

entities, and
that he will likely not certify a class of individual consumers. The draft opinion indicates

that
the decision would be immediately appealable. We disagree that such a class can be

appropriately
certified and intend to appeal this point, should Judge Weinstein certify such a class. In

2007,
The Pennsylvania Employees Trust Fund brought claims in state court in Pennsylvania as

insurer of
Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed Zyprexa on similar grounds as described in

the
New York cases. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we

inadequately
tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We cannot determine with

certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be
asserted. The ultimate resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation could

have a
material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial
position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, we have been named

as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits
involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (DES)&nbsp;and thimerosal. The majority of these

claims are
covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of the nature of

pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to
large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future. In

the
past few years, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance

due to a
very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently

marketed
products, we have been
 and expect that we will continue to be completely self-insured for future product liability

losses.
In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance
carriers on past claims.

</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our
full-year 2008 earnings guidance on a GAAP basis  is now $3.79 to $3.94 per share. The change from earlier
guidance of $3.90 to $4.05 per share results from the previously mentioned second-quarter 2008
significant items totaling $.11 per share that are reflected in our financial results. Our
full-year 2008 guidance does not reflect the potential charges related to the acquisition of SGX
Pharmaceuticals or the sale of our Greenfield, Indiana site. We have also revised other aspects of our
previously-issued 2008 full-year financial guidance. These revisions are primarily driven by the
continued strength of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Stronger foreign
currencies result in higher growth rates for our sales, for our marketing, selling and
administrative expenses and, to a lesser extent, for our research and development expenses. In
addition, in the shortterm, stronger foreign currencies result in a decrease to our gross margin
as a percent of sales.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Sales are now expected to grow in the high-single to low-double digits, an increase from the
previous guidance of growth in the mid- to high-single digits. Including the second-quarter 2008
asset impairment charges, we expect gross margin as a percent of sales to be essentially flat. The
sum of marketing, selling and administrative expenses and research and development expenses is now
expected to grow in the high-single digits, an increase from the previous guidance of growth in the
mid-single digits. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are now expected to grow in the
high-single digits, an increase from the previous guidance of growth in the low-single digits. In
addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates, these expenses are now expected to be higher due
to increased litigation-related expenses and accelerated prelaunch investment in prasugrel. We still
expect research and development expenses to grow in the high-single to low-double digits. Other
income and deductions are still expected to contribute less than $100&nbsp;million. Excluding the
effect of the resolution of the IRS income tax audit in the first quarter of 2008, the effective
tax rate is still expected to be approximately 22&nbsp;percent.

<DIV style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2007, the company received two demands from shareholders that the board of directors cause the
company to take legal action against current and former directors and others for allegedly causing
damage to the company through improper marketing of Evista, Prozac, and Zyprexa. In accordance
with procedures established under the Indiana Business Corporation Law (Ind. Code &#167; 23-1-32), the
board has appointed a committee of independent persons to consider the demands and determine what
action, if any, the company should take in response. Since January&nbsp;2008, we have been served with
seven shareholder derivative lawsuits: <I>Lambrecht, et al. v. Taurel, et al.</I>, filed January&nbsp;17,
2008,in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana; <I>Staehr et al. v.
Eli Lilly and Company et al., </I>filed March&nbsp;27, 2008, in Marion County Superior Court in

<I>Zemprelli v. Taurel, et al</I>., filed June&nbsp;24, 2008, in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Indiana. Two of these lawsuits were filed by the shareholders who served the
demands described above. All seven lawsuits are nominally filed on behalf of the company, against
various current and former directors and officers and allege that the named officers and directors
harmed the company through the improper marketing of Zyprexa, and in certain suits, Evista and
Prozac. The Zemprelli suit also claims that certain defendants violated sections 10(b) and 20(a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We believe these shareholder derivative lawsuits are
without merit and are prepared to defend against them vigorously.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2004 we, along with several other pharmaceutical companies, were named in one consolidated case in Minnesota federal court brought on behalf of consumers alleging that the conduct of pharmaceutical companies in preventing commercial importation of prescription drugs from outside the United States violated antitrust laws, and one case in California state court brought
by several pharmacies in which plaintiffs&#146; claims  were  less specifically
stated, but  were  substantially similar to the claims asserted in Minnesota. Both cases
sought restitution for alleged overpayments for pharmaceuticals and an injunction against
the allegedly violative conduct. The federal district court in the Minnesota case dismissed the federal claims
 and held that the state claims must be brought in separate state court
actions. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has affirmed the
district court&#146;s decision, and the time for further appeals
has lapsed. In the California case, summary judgment was granted to us and the other defendants.
In July 2008, the California Court of Appeals affirmed that decision.  Plaintiffs may petition the California
Supreme Court to accept a further appeal.</div>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have been named in a lawsuit brought by the Labor Attorney for 15<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP> Region in the
Labor Court of Paulinia, State of Sao Paulo, alleging possible harm to employees and former
employees caused by exposure to heavy metals. We have also been named in approximately 50 lawsuits
filed in the same court by individual former employees making similar claims. The company believes
these lawsuits are without merit and is prepared to defend against them vigorously.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the patent, product liability, or
other legal actions brought against us or the ultimate cost of environmental matters, we believe
that, except as noted above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to the
consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;5, 2008 we entered into an agreement to sell most of our Greenfield, Indiana site to
Covance, Inc. (Covance). This site currently houses our preclinical toxicology group and our
animal health division, Elanco, as well as other, smaller business groups. As part of this
agreement, Covance will purchase the site and continue certain operations there. Covance
currently provides toxicology and early-phase clinical services to us, and as part of this
arrangement we have entered into a ten-year service agreement expanding the scope of our
existing relationship. We plan to relocate Elanco&#146;s operations to a new site. This
arrangement is subject to certain closing conditions, including completion of due diligence and
clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Covance will take possession
of the Greenfield site upon closing, which we anticipate will occur later this year. In
addition, on August&nbsp;5, 2008, we signed agreements with Quintiles, Inc. (Quintiles) for clinical
trial monitoring services and with Ingenix Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., doing business as i3
Statprobe (i3), for clinical data management services. The Quintiles and i3 agreements will
become effective later this year. All of these agreements are part of our ongoing
transformation into a more flexible organization. We expect to incur asset impairment and
severance charges in connection with these arrangements which will likely be significant:
however, we are unable to estimate the amount of the charges at this time.
