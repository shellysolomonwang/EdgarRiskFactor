Item 1A. Risk FactorsThis Item should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors disclosures in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure. We rely to a large extent on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure. The size and complexity of these systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack. Likewise, confidentiality or data privacy breaches by employees or others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that trade secrets, personal information, or other sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Events of this nature have been infrequent in occurrence and their aggregate impact on our operations and expenses has not been material. While we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent future breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely and materially affect our business.Item 2.
