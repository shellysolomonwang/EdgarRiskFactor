We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.  Intuitive®, Intuitive Surgical®, da Vinci®, da Vinci®S™, da Vinci S HD Surgical System™, da Vinci Sonicpro™, EndoWrist®, InSite®, 3DHD™, Cardiovac™, Clearfield®, Alpha®, AESOP®, HERMES®, and ZEUS®, are trademarks of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.  Overview  Products. We design, manufacture and market da Vinci Surgical Systems, which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery. The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeon’s console, a patient-side cart and a high performance vision system. The product line also includes proprietary “wristed” instruments and surgical accessories. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly translates the surgeon’s natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro-movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical System is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and 3-D HD visualization, while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery, or MIS. By placing computer-enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the invasiveness of complex surgical procedures. The da Vinci Surgical System is sold into multiple surgical specialties, principally urology, gynecology, cardiothoracic, and general surgery.  Business Model. In our business model, we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, comprised of instrument, accessory, service and training revenue. The da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for approximately $1.0 million to $1.7 million, depending on configuration, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. We then generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da Vinci Surgical System. EndoWrist instruments and accessories will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery and will need to be replaced as they are consumed. We generate additional recurring revenue from ongoing system service. We typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period, typically at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $150,000 per year, depending on configuration of the underlying system.  Since the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System in 1999, our established base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown and robotic surgery volume has increased. Recurring revenue has grown at an equal or faster rate than system revenue. Over the past five years, revenue generated from the sale of instruments and accessories, service and training increased from 33% of revenue in 2003 to 46% of revenue in 2007. Recurring revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2008 was $89.1 million, or 47% of total revenue. We expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future.    14    Table of Contents Regulatory Activities  We believe that we have obtained all of the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States. As we make additions to target procedures, we will continue to obtain the necessary clearances. The following table lists chronologically our FDA clearances to date:        •    July 2000—General laparoscopic procedures        •    March 2001—Non-cardiac thoracoscopic procedures        •    May 2001—Prostatectomy procedures        •    November 2002—Cardiotomy procedures        •    July 2004—Cardiac revascularization procedures        •    March 2005—Urologic surgical procedures        •    April 2005—Gynecologic surgical procedures        •    June 2005—Pediatric surgical procedures  On March 19, 2008, we received clearance to market our system-held cardiac stabilizer and permission to remove the warning in our labeling regarding system use in non-arrested heart procedures.  2008 Business Events and Trends  Introduction. We experienced rapid growth during 2007 and through the first quarter of 2008, which was driven by the continued adoption of the da Vinci Surgical System for use in urologic, gynecologic, cardiothoracic, and general surgeries.  First Quarter 2008 Financial Highlights        •    Revenue grew 65% to $188.2 million from $114.2 million during the first quarter of 2007.        •    Recurring revenue grew 53% to $89.1 million from $58.1 million during the first quarter of 2007.        •    Instruments and accessories revenue grew 54% to $61.9 million from $40.3 million during the first quarter of 2007.        •    System revenue grew 76% to $99.1 million from $56.1 million during the first quarter of 2007.        •    We sold 74 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the first quarter of 2008, an increase of 68% compared to 44 in the first quarter of 2007.        •    As of March 31, 2008, we had a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of 867 systems, 647 in United States, 148 in Europe, and 72 in the rest of the world.        •    Operating income increased by 89% to $64.9 million, or 34% of revenue, during the first quarter of 2008 from $34.3 million, or 30% of revenue during the first quarter of 2007. Operating income included $14.6 million and $8.1 million during the first quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for the estimated value of employee stock options and stock purchases.        •    Our business continues to demonstrate the ability to generate significant positive cash flow while supporting our rapid business growth. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased by $64.3 million from the fourth quarter of 2007, as we ended the first quarter of 2008 with $699.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments.    15    Table of Contents Procedure adoption  We believe the adoption of da Vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure, and it is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value. The value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes, less surgical trauma, or both.  The procedures that have driven the most growth in our business recently are the da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) and the da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH). dVP procedures are expected to grow approximately 40% from 2007 to 2008 and dVH procedures are expected to grow approximately 150% from 2007 to 2008.    16    Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of income information (in thousands):                        Three months Ended        March 31,2008   % of totalrevenue     March 31,2007   % of totalrevenue     Revenue:                   Products   $ 160,951   86 %   $ 96,449   84 %   Services     27,243   14 %     17,780   16 %                             Total revenue     188,194   100 %     114,229   100 %                             Cost of revenue:                   Products     44,852   24 %     29,106   25 %   Services     13,535   7 %     8,615   8 %                             Total cost of revenue     58,387   31 %     37,721   33 %                             Products gross profit     116,099   62 %     67,343   59 %   Services gross profit     13,708   7 %     9,165   8 %                             Gross profit     129,807   69 %     76,508   67 %                             Operating costs and expenses:                   Selling, general, and administrative     48,634   26 %     33,945   30 %   Research and development     16,301   9 %     8,224   7 %                             Total operating costs and expenses     64,935   35 %     42,169   37 %                             Income from operations     64,872   34 %     34,339   30 %   Interest and other income, net     8,541   5 %     4,608   4 %                             Income before taxes     73,413   39 %     38,947   34 %   Income tax expense     28,632   15 %     15,145   13 %                             Net income   $ 44,781   24 %   $ 23,802   21 %                            Total Revenue  Total revenue increased to $188.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008 from $114.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2007. First quarter of 2008 revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci surgery. We believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure. Our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption in all of our target procedures. da Vinci prostatectomy (dVP) has been our most successful procedure to date and has been a significant sales catalyst. An increasing body of clinical evidence has indicated that dVP offers superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal, continence, and sexual potency. In 2006 and through the first quarter of 2008, da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH) has been one of our fastest growing procedures. Favorable clinical results have been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology, which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion. For most patients who otherwise would have open surgery, a minimally invasive approach using the da Vinci Surgical System offers reduced pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays and a quicker return to normal daily activities .  Revenue within the United States accounted for 77% of total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 82% of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2007. We believe domestic revenue accounts for the large majority of total revenue primarily due to the competitive nature of the domestic healthcare market. As adoption progresses and as we reach standard of care for target procedures, we expect international revenue to continue to increase as a percentage of overall revenue.    17    Table of Contents The following table summarizes our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 (in millions, except percentages ):                    Three MonthsEnded March 31,        2008     2007     Revenue              Instruments and accessories   $ 61.9     $ 40.3     Systems     99.1       56.1                       Total product revenue     161.0       96.4     Services and training     27.2       17.8                       Total revenue   $ 188.2     $ 114.2                       Recurring revenue   $ 89.1     $ 58.1                       % of total revenue     47 %     51 %   Domestic   $ 144.0     $ 93.2     International     44.2       21.0                       Total revenue   $ 188.2     $ 114.2                       % of domestic revenue     77 %     82 %   % of international revenue     23 %     18 %  Product Revenue  Product revenue increased to $161.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008 from $96.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2007. The $64.5 million (67%) increase was due to higher revenue from sales of instruments and accessories, and systems.  Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $61.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008, up 54% compared with $40.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2007. The increase is driven by a similar increase in procedures. Procedure growth occurred in all our targeted procedures with prostatectomy and hysterectomy being the largest drivers of growth. Utilization per installed system for the three months ended March 31, 2008 also increased as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2007.  Systems revenue increased to $99.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2008 from $56.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2007, primarily due to the growth in the number of system unit sales, reflecting adoption of robotic surgery, increased average selling price (ASPs) resulting from the higher priced da Vinci S and da Vinci S HD Surgical Systems, and favorable foreign exchange impact of Euro-denominated sales. We sold 74 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the three months ended March 31, 2008, compared to 44 systems sold during the three months ended March 31, 2007.  The following table summarizes da Vinci Surgical System unit sales for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007:    18    Table of Contents             Three Months EndedMarch 31,      2008   2007   da Vinci S 3-D HD   60   21   da Vinci S 4-arm   10   17   da Vinci S 3-arm   3   —    standard da Vinci   1   6             Total   74   44            We also recognized revenue from HD and fourth arm upgrades of $1.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2008 compared to $1.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2007. The average revenue recognized per da Vinci system sold increased to $1.32 million during the three months ended March 31, 2008, compared to $1.25 million during the three months ended March 31, 2007 primarily due to the sales mix of da Vinci S and da Vinci S HD Systems which have a higher selling price than standard da Vinci Systems .  Service Revenue  Service revenue, comprised primarily of system service, increased to $27.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008 from $17.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2007. We typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold. These service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service period. Higher service revenue for first quarter of 2008 was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue and higher revenue earned per system under service contract. There were approximately 795 systems under service contract entering the first quarter of 2008 generating an average of $34,000 per system for the quarter, compared to 559 systems entering the first quarter of 2007 generating an average of $32,000 per system. The increase in service revenue per system was driven by a higher percentage of the installed base being comprised of da Vinci S and da Vinci S HD Surgical Systems, which carry a higher contractual service rate than standard model da Vinci Systems.  Gross Profit  Product gross profit during the three months ended March 31, 2008 was $116.1 million, or 72% of product revenue, compared to $67.3 million, or 70% of product revenue, during the three months ended March 31, 2007. The higher first quarter of 2008 product gross profit was driven by higher 2008 product revenue, as described above. The higher 2008 product gross profit percentage was driven by the higher 2008 da Vinci Surgical Systems average selling prices, higher margins earned on Euro-based sales, and instrument and system material cost reductions. Product gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 included $1.3 and $0.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, respectively.  Service gross profit during the three months ended March 31, 2008 was $13.7 million, or 50% of service revenue, compared to $9.2 million, or 52% during the three months ended March 31, 2007. The higher first quarter of 2008 service gross profit is a result of the higher service revenue for the period. The decline in service gross margin percentage was primarily due to higher 2008 service inventory repair costs and stock-based compensation expenses. Service gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 included $1.0 and $0.5 million of stock-based compensation expenses, respectively.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2008 were $48.6 million, up 43% from $33.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2007. The increase is due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, higher commissions and other variable compensation related to higher revenue levels, and increased stock-based compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the future to support our expanding business. Stock-based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 were $9.0 million and $5.2 million, respectively.  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. These enhancements represent significant improvements to our products.    19    Table of Contents Research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2008 were $16.3 million, compared to $8.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2007. The increase is due to the growth in our research and development organization, costs associated with co-development arrangements with third parties, higher prototype expenses, and stock-based compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses charged to research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 were $3.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses, including the aforementioned co-development arrangements with third parties, will continue to increase in the future.  Interest and Other Income, Net  Interest and other income, net, comprised mostly of interest income, was $8.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008, compared to $4.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2007. The increase resulted from $2.8 million of higher interest income earned on higher cash and investment balances and $1.1 million of foreign exchange gains.  Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2008 was $28.6 million, or 39.0% of pre-tax income, compared to $15.1 million, or 38.9% of pre-tax income for the three months ended March 31, 2007. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2008 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes, partially offset by domestic production deductions. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2007 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes, partially offset by research and development credits. We have net operating loss carry forwards and employee stock tax benefits that will be utilized in fiscal 2008. Approximately $41.3 million of employee stock tax benefits have been generated in the three months ended March 31, 2008. As a result, we estimate that our cash outlay for income taxes in fiscal year 2008 will be less than 25% of pre-tax income.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Sources and Uses of Cash  Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents plus short and long-term investments increased from $635.4 million at December 31, 2007 to $699.7 million at March 31, 2008. Cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing and financing needs.  Consolidated Cash Flow Data                   Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2008   2007        (in thousands)     Net cash provided by (used in)        Operating activities   $ 39,384   $ 33,369     Investing activities     33,742     (37,131 )   Financing activities     34,260     22,127     Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents     597     —                      Net increase in cash and cash equivalents   $ 107,983   $ 18,365                      20    Table of Contents Operating Activities  For the three months ended March 31, 2008, cash flow from operations of $39.4 million was 88% of our net income of $44.8 million for the following reasons:        1. Our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of stock-based compensation, taxes, and depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets. These non-cash charges totaled $17.4 million.        2. We invested $22.8 million in working capital for the three months ended March 31, 2008.  Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $5.3 million or 4% in the first quarter of 2008, reflecting the timing of system sales. Inventory increased $6.4 million or 20% in the first quarter of 2008 reflecting growth in our business . Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $5.4 million or 10% in the first quarter of 2008, which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities decreased $15.6 million or 16% in the first quarter of 2008 primarily due to the payment of 2007 incentive compensation and the purchase of stock by employees under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) during the three months ended March 31, 2008.  For the three months ended March 31, 2007, cash flow from operations of $33.4 million exceeded our net income of $23.8 for the following reasons:        1. Our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of stock-based compensation, taxes, depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets of approximately $11.9 million.        2. We invested $2.3 million in working capital for the three months ended March 31, 2007.  Investing Activities  Net cash provided by investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2008 consisted primarily of sales and maturities of investments (net of proceeds from purchases of investments) of $40.7 million, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of $6.9 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2007 consisted primarily of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $34.4 million and purchases of property and equipment and licensing of patents of $2.7 million. Our investments are in U.S. government notes and bonds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and auction rate securities. We generated approximately 4.4% interest in the first quarter of 2008. We are not a capital-intensive business. Our purchases of property and equipment during the three months ended March 31, 2008 related mainly to facilities improvements and information technology infrastructure to support capacity expansion in our business.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2008 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises of $15.0 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $19.2 million. Net cash flows provided by financing activities in the first quarter of 2007 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option and warrants exercises of $9.7 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $12.5 million.  Auction Rate Securities  As of March 31, 2008, we held approximately $91 million of municipal bonds with an auction reset feature (“auction rate securities”) whose underlying assets are generally student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government. In February 2008, auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed. Based on the overall failure rate of these auctions, the frequency of the failures, and the underlying maturities of the securities, a portion of which are greater than 30 years, we have classified these investments as long-term assets on our balance sheet. These investments were valued at fair value as of March 31, 2008.  All of our auction rate securities are currently rated AAA, the highest rating, by a rating agency. If the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or refinance their debt in the near term and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an additional impairment charge on these investments. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan.    21    Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 and we have added the following two polices discussed below.  Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157). In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”, which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually. Therefore, we have adopted the provisions of FAS 157 with respect to its financial assets and liabilities only. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under SFAS 157 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under SFAS 157 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:        •    Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.        •    Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.        •    Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis. We did not elect to adopt the fair value option for certain financial instruments on the adoption date.       ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Interest Rate and Market Risk  The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. government agencies, municipal bonds which may have an auction reset feature, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds. The securities, other than money market funds, are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). All investments mature within approximately 3 years from the date of purchase excluding auction rate securities. Our holdings of the securities of any one issuer, except government agencies, do not exceed 5% of the portfolio. If interest rates rise, the market value of our investments may decline, which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity. A hypothetical increase in interest rate by 25 basis points would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately $1.1 million as of March 31, 2008. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks.  As of March 31, 2008, we held approximately $91 million of municipal bonds, classified as long-term assets, with an auction reset feature (“auction rate securities”) whose underlying assets are generally student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government. In February 2008, auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed. Effective January 1, 2008, we determine the fair market values of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in     22    Table of Contents  SFAS 157 which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs (Level 1 and Level 2 inputs) and minimize the use of unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) when measuring fair value. Given the current failures in the auction markets to provide quoted market prices of the securities as well as the lack of any correlation of these instruments to other observable market data, we valued these securities using a discounted cash flow methodology with the most significant input categorized as Level 3. Significant inputs that went into the model were the credit quality of the issuer, the percentage and the types of guarantees (such as Federal Family Education Loan Program—FFELP), the probability of the auction succeeding or the security being called, and an illiquidity discount factor. Changes in the assumptions of our model based on dynamic market conditions could have a significant impact on the valuation of these securities, which may lead us in the future to take an impairment charge for these securities.  Foreign Exchange Risk  The majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, since a portion of our operations consists of sales activities outside of the United States, we have entered into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Euro, and therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk. Our foreign operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency.  For the three months ended March 31, 2008, sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 11%, of total revenue. For the three months ended March 31, 2008, our revenue would have decreased by approximately $2.1 million, if the US dollar exchange rate used would have strengthened by 10%. In addition, we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. A 10% strengthening of the US dollar exchange rate at March 31, 2008, would have resulted in a $3.6 million decrease in the carrying amounts of those net assets.  Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our exchange rate risks.       ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2008.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.    23    Table of Contents  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION       ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  We are involved in various ordinary and routine legal proceedings and disputes that arise in the normal course of business. These matters include product liability actions, patent infringement actions, contract disputes, and other matters. We do not know whether we will prevail in these matters nor can we assure that any remedy could be reached on commercially viable terms, if at all. Based on currently available information, we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these actions and that the resolution of these cases is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or future results of operations. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”, we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.       ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  There have been no material changes in the Company’s risk factors from those disclosed in the 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K.       ITEM 2.
