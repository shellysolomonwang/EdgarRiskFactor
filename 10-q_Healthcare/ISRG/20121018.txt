Item 1A: Risk Factors”. Our actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.  Intuitive® , Intuitive Surgical®, da Vinci®, da Vinci S®, da Vinci® Si HD Surgical System™, da Vinci S HD Surgical System®, da Vinci® Si™, da Vinci® Si-e™, EndoWrist®, EndoWrist® One™, Single-Site™, DVSTAT®, Firefly™ and InSite® are trademarks of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.  Overview  Products. We design, manufacture and market da Vinci Surgical Systems, which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery. We believe that this new generation of surgery, which we call da Vinci surgery, extends the benefits of minimally invasive surgery (“MIS”) to a broader patient base. The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeon’s console, or consoles, a patient-side cart and a high performance vision system. The da Vinci Surgical System translates the surgeon’s natural hand movements, which are performed on instrument controls at a console, into corresponding micro-movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small incisions, or ports. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical System provides the surgeon with intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and 3-D, HD vision, while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of MIS.   By placing computer-enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to deliver higher value minimally invasive surgical procedures to their patients. We model patient value as equal to: procedure efficacy / invasiveness. Here procedure efficacy is a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is how disruptive and painful the treatment is itself. When the patient value of a da Vinci procedure is deemed higher than alternate treatment options, patients may seek out surgeons and hospitals that offer that specific da Vinci procedure, potentially resulting in a local market share shift for the specific treatment. Adoption occurs procedure by procedure, and is driven by the relative patient value of da Vinci procedures compared to alternative treatment options for the same disease state.  Business Model. In our business model, we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of new and refurbished da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, derived from sales of instruments, accessories, and service. The new and refurbished da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for between $1.0 million and $2.3 million, depending on configuration and geography, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. We then generate recurring revenue as our customers consume our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da Vinci Surgical System. EndoWrist instruments and accessories have a limited life and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery, at which point they are replaced. We also generate recurring revenue from ongoing system service. We typically enter into multi-year service contracts at the time systems are sold generally at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $170,000 per year, depending on the configuration of the underlying system. The large majority of these service contracts have been renewed at the end of the initial contract periods.  Recurring revenue has grown at a rate equal to or faster than the rate of growth of system revenue. Recurring revenue increased from $752.7 million, or 53% of total revenue in 2010 to $979.5 million, or 56% of total revenue in 2011 to $901.5 million, or 57% of total revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2012. The increase in recurring revenue relative to system revenue reflects continuing adoption of procedures on a growing base of installed da Vinci Surgical Systems and gradually increasing customer utilization per system. We expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future. The installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown to 2,462 at September 30, 2012, compared with 2,132 at December 31, 2011 and 2,031 at September 30, 2011.  We have a direct sales force in the United States, Korea and Europe, excluding Spain, Italy, Greece and Eastern European countries. We utilize distributors in all other markets that we serve. On January 11, 2012, we completed the acquisition of our Korean distributor and began selling directly to Korean customers. The transaction was not material to our financial statements and is not expected to have a material impact on our future operations.  Procedures  The adoption of da Vinci surgery has the potential to progress for those procedures that offer greater patient value than non-da Vinci alternatives. We model patient value as equal to procedure efficacy / invasiveness. Here procedure efficacy is a measure of the success    15    Table of Contents  of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is how disruptive and painful the treatment is itself. When the patient value of robotic surgery is higher than alternate treatment options, patients may seek out surgeons and hospitals that offer that specific da Vinci procedure. Adoption occurs procedure by procedure, and is driven by the relative patient value of da Vinci procedures compared to alternatives for the same disease state.  We focus our organization and investments on developing, marketing and training those products and procedures where we believe da Vinci can bring significant patient value relative to competitive therapies. An increasing body of peer reviewed literature has indicated that da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) and da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH) may offer improved functional outcomes as compared to traditional open surgery. Similarly, early indications are that da Vinci Surgery in our other key surgeries (da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy, da Vinci Myomectomy, da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy, da Vinci Mitral Valve Repair, da Vinci Lobectomy, da Vinci Low Anterior Colon Resections, and da Vinci Transoral Robotic Surgery (for cancers of the throat), may also offer improved functional outcomes as compared to traditional open surgery. For many patients, a minimally invasive approach using the da Vinci Surgical System may also offer reduced pain, reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stays, reduced post-operative complications and a quicker return to normal daily activities when compared to open surgery.  In 2011, approximately 360,000 surgical procedures were performed with the da Vinci Surgical System, up approximately 29% compared with 2010. The growth in our overall procedure volume was driven primarily by da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH) in the U.S., da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) outside the U.S. and other urologic and gynecologic procedures including Nephrectomy (partial and full), Sacrocolpopexy, Myomectomy and Endometriosis Resection in the U.S. Emerging procedures within other specialties, including lobectomy for lung cancer and low anterior resection for colon cancer also contributed to 2011 procedure growth.  dVH is our highest volume procedure, having surpassed dVP in 2010. dVH procedure volume grew from approximately 110,000 cases in 2010 to approximately 146,000 cases in 2011, of which approximately 39,000 were for the treatment of cancer and the remaining 107,000 related to benign conditions. The very large majority of our 2011 dVH volume came from the U.S. market, where we estimate the total annual addressable robotic market to be approximately 300,000 to 350,000 cases, of which approximately 50,000 are for cancer.  dVP procedure volume grew from approximately 98,000 cases in 2010 to approximately 113,000 cases worldwide in 2011. We estimate that the majority of the approximately 85,000 prostatectomies performed in the U.S. in 2011 were done robotically with the da Vinci Surgical System. The majority of our 2011 worldwide dVP growth came from European markets, led by Germany and France.  Other procedures (non-dVH/dVP) grew over approximately 40% in 2011 to approximately 101,000 cases. Growth in these other procedures was driven by da Vinci adoption in urologic and gynecologic procedures such as da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy and da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy as well as early stage growth in other emerging procedures from other surgical specialties, including lobectomy for lung cancer, low anterior resection for colon cancer, and transoral robotic surgery (“TORS”) for head and neck surgery. While early results in emerging procedures are encouraging and may point to significant patient value, their growth is off of smaller absolute bases and their future growth rates are uncertain.  Total 2012 da Vinci procedures through the first three quarters grew approximately 25%, driven by growth in Gynecology and General Surgery procedures in the U.S., partially offset by an approximately 20% reduction in dVP procedures in the U.S. We believe the reduction in dVP procedures in the U.S. primarily reflects pressures from reduced levels of prostate-specific antigen (“PSA”) testing and increases in non-surgical disease management. dVP’s and total procedures have declined in Europe from the first quarter of 2012 to the second and third quarters of 2012, reflecting seasonality and austerity measures as well as the PSA testing and non-surgical disease management trends that have impacted the U.S.  Regulatory Activities  We believe that we have obtained the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States and most of Europe. As we make additions to target procedures and introduce new products, we will continue to seek necessary clearances.  In November 2009, we received regulatory (Shonin) approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (“MHLW”) for our da Vinci S System in Japan. We have sold 70 systems into Japan through September 30, 2012. These sales were primarily made to early adopters. Since receiving Shonin approval, we have been focusing our efforts on obtaining specific reimbursement for da Vinci procedures in Japan and building our own organization, Intuitive Surgical Japan. Prior to April 2012, we had partnered with the experienced regulatory team from Johnson & Johnson K.K. Medical Company (“JJKK”) in our Japanese regulatory process. In    16    Table of Contents  April 2012, the Marketing Authorization Application for da Vinci products was transferred to Intuitive Surgical Japan from JJKK, and Intuitive Surgical Japan now has primary responsibility for regulatory support of our products in Japan. We continue to partner with Adachi Co., LTD as our separate independent distribution partner in Japan who is responsible for marketing, selling, and servicing our products in Japan. Effective April 2012, we obtained national reimbursement for dVP procedures in Japan. If we are not successful in obtaining additional regulatory clearances, importation licenses, and adequate procedure reimbursements for future products and procedures, then the demand for our products in Japan could be limited.  2012 Business Events and Trends  Economic Environment. The credit and sovereign debt issues impacting Europe have slowed capital sales and curtailed procedure growth throughout most of 2012. European procedure growth of approximately 17% for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was lower than we anticipated. Although capital sales and procedure growth outside of Europe have been strong, European uncertainties could adversely impact demand for our products globally. Demand for da Vinci systems fluctuates quarter to quarter based upon changing economic and geopolitical factors.  da Vinci Prostatectomy. The U.S. Preventive Service Task Force recommendation against PSA screening, as well as changes in treatment patterns for low risk prostate cancer away from definitive treatment, have led to a decline in our dVP business. We estimate that U.S. dVP declined approximately 20% in the third quarter of 2012 compared with the same period in 2011. We are unable to predict the extent to which these recommendations and treatment pattern changes will be followed by governments or clinicians within non-U.S. jurisdictions.  da Vinci Skills Simulator. In the first quarter of 2011, we began shipping our da Vinci Skills Simulator. The simulator is a practice tool for the da Vinci Si Surgical System that gives a user the opportunity to practice in his or her facility with the surgeon console controls. The simulator incorporates three-dimensional, physics-based computer simulation technology to immerse the user within a virtual environment. The user navigates through the environment and completes exercises by controlling virtual instruments from the surgeon console. Upon completion of a skills exercise, the simulator provides a quantitative assessment of user performance based on a variety of task-specific metrics. The simulator is intended to augment, not replace, existing training programs for the da Vinci Si Surgical System. Most da Vinci Skills Simulators have been sold in connection with new da Vinci Si Surgical System sales. We sold 87 and 310 da Vinci Skills Simulators during the three and nine months ended September, 2012, respectively, compared with 98 and 260 units during the same periods in 2011.  da Vinci Single-Site Instruments. da Vinci Single-Site is a set of instruments and accessories that allow the da Vinci Si systems to work through a single incision, typically in the umbilicus, rather than multiple incisions. Single incision surgery is intended to minimize trauma to patients by reducing the number of ports required to enter the body. Non-robotic single incision surgery today is typically performed with modified laparoscopic instruments. Early clinical adoption of this manual technique has been mostly positive, however, physicians have reported that manual single incision surgery is technically and ergonomically challenging. da Vinci Single-Site instruments and accessories were designed to address these issues. In February 2011, we received the CE mark for our da Vinci Single-Site instrument kit and began selling these new products in Europe. The majority of da Vinci Single-Site procedures performed in Europe to date has been cholecystectomies. In December 2011, we received Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) FDA regulatory clearance to market our Single-Site instrumentation in the United States for laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures, our only United States clearance to date. We are encouraged by early hospital, surgeon, and patient interest in da Vinci Single-Site, with over 350 U.S. customers having purchased da Vinci Single-Site kits as of September 30, 2012. However, as we are in the early stages of introducing this instrumentation to the U.S. market, we are not able to predict the extent to which da Vinci Single-Site may be adopted. We are working on expanding our da Vinci Single-Site instrument offering to enable its use in additional indications. In the third quarter of 2012, we submitted and have received from the FDA questions on our 510(k) submission for da Vinci Single-Site instruments and indications for use in benign Hysterectomy and Salpingo oophorectomy.  da Vinci Firefly Fluorescence Imaging. In the first quarter of 2011, we launched our Firefly Fluorescence Imaging product (“Firefly”) for use with the da Vinci Si Surgical System in the U.S. and Europe. This new imaging capability combines a fluorescent dye with a specialized da Vinci camera head, endoscope and laser-based illuminator to allow surgeons to identify vasculature in three dimensions beneath tissue surfaces to visualize critical anatomy. Firefly kits configured into new da Vinci system sales are included in systems revenue, while Firefly kits sold separately for existing systems are included in instruments and accessories revenue. Adoption of Firefly is progressing, with its primary utilization in partial nephrectomy procedures. Firefly is also being used in certain gynecology and general surgery cases.  EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer. In December 2011, we received FDA clearance for the EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer. The EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer is a wristed, single-use instrument intended for bipolar coagulation and mechanical transection of vessels up to 7 mm in diameter and tissue bundles that fit in the jaws of the instrument. This instrument enables da Vinci Si surgeons to fully control vessel sealing, while providing the benefits of da Vinci Surgery. This instrument is designed to enhance surgical efficiency and autonomy in a variety of general surgery and gynecologic procedures. Clinical response to the EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer has been encouraging, with positive commentary on precision, articulation, vessel sealing quality and thermal spread. We expect applications    17    Table of Contents  for the EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer to be centered on general surgery and gynecologic oncology procedures. We are still in the early stages of introducing EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer and are not able to predict the extent to which the EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer may be adopted.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, total revenue increased to $1,569.5 million from $1,260.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. Total revenue growth for these periods was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci Surgery, resulting largely from growth in U.S. gynecologic procedures, including dVH, Sacrocolpopexy, Endometriosis Resection, and Myomectomy; U.S. general surgery procedures, including Cholecystectomy and colon procedures; and dVP procedures growth in international markets, partially offset by a decline of approximately 20% in dVP procedures in the U.S. The reduction in dVP procedures in the U.S. reflects pressures from reduced levels of PSA testing and non-surgical disease management. Procedure growth in Europe was lower than our overall growth due to broad economic pressures, structural issues, need for increased depth in our commercial organization as well as the PSA testing and non-surgical disease management trends that have impacted the U.S.  Revenue within the United States accounted for 79% and 80% of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, and 79% and 78% of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively. We believe domestic revenue has accounted for the large majority of total revenue primarily due to rapid procedure adoption in the United States driven by the ability of patients to choose their provider and method of treatment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, international revenue grew in absolute dollars compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher system sales in the Japanese market and higher instrument and accessory sales driven by increased procedures. The credit and sovereign debt issues impacting Europe have slowed capital sales and procedure growth in that region, and our European sales reflect a challenging economic environment.  In September 2012, we entered into a contract with Department of Veteran Affairs (“VA”) for $34.0 million of systems, skill simulators and instruments and accessories. The products are required to be delivered to the customer’s designated sites within a period of 120 calendar days after the execution of the contract. The contract is cancellable and the customer is not obligated to purchase the full amount of the contract. In September 2012, we entered into a separate contract with Department of Defense for $34.0 million with a customer for instruments and accessories over a five-year period. The contract is cancellable and the customer is not obligated to purchase the full amount of the contract. No deliveries have occurred under the two contracts during the quarter ended September 30, 2012.    19    Table of Contents The following table summarizes our revenue and da Vinci Surgical System unit sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 (in millions, except percentages and unit sales):                            Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2012     2011     2012     2011     Revenue                        Instruments and accessories   $ 218.0     $ 175.8     $ 649.5     $ 504.7     Systems     232.0       199.1       668.0       552.8                                               Total product revenue     450.0       374.9       1,317.5       1,057.5     Services     87.8       71.8       252.0       203.0                                               Total revenue   $ 537.8     $ 446.7     $ 1,569.5     $ 1,260.5                                               Recurring revenue   $ 305.8     $ 247.6     $ 901.5     $ 707.7                                               % of total revenue     57 %      55 %      57 %      56 %    Domestic   $ 422.6     $ 352.3     $ 1,248.6     $ 988.4     International     115.2       94.4       320.9       272.1                                               Total revenue   $ 537.8     $ 446.7     $ 1,569.5     $ 1,260.5                                               % of Revenue - Domestic     79 %      79 %      80 %      78 %    % of Revenue - International     21 %      21 %      20 %      22 %    Unit Sales by Region:                        Domestic unit sales     114       99       343       287     International unit sales     41       34       102       95                                               Total Unit Sales     155       133       445       382                                               Unit Sales by Model:                        da Vinci Si-e - Single console Unit Sales (3 arm)     6       4       13       11     da Vinci Si - Single console Unit Sales (4 arm)      113       84       327       274     da Vinci Si - Dual console Unit Sales     20       29       73       66                                               Total da Vinci Si Unit Sales     139       117       413       351     da Vinci S Unit Sales     16       16       32       31                                               Total Unit Sales     155       133       445       382                                               Unit Sales involving System Trade-ins:                        Unit sales trading in da Vinci standard Surgical Systems     8       14       39       42     Unit sales trading in da Vinci S Surgical Systems     26       21       76       61                                               Total unit sales involving trade-ins     34       35       115       103     Unit Sales not trading in any systems     121       98       330       279                                               Total Unit Sales     155       133       445       382                                                20    Table of Contents Product Revenue  Product revenue was $450.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012 compared with $374.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011.  Instruments and accessories revenue increased 24% to $218.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012 compared with $175.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011. Instrument and accessory revenue growth was driven by approximately 22% higher da Vinci surgical procedure volume and revenue generated from initial sales of new instrument and accessory products, including Single-Site, Firefly, thoracic lung kit and the EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer, prior to procedures being performed. Overall procedure growth was led by U.S. gynecologic procedures, driven by dVH, Sacrocolpopexy, Endometriosis Resection, and Myomectomy; U.S. general surgery growth, driven by Cholecystectomy and colon procedures; and dVP growth in international markets partially offset by a decline in dVP procedures in the U.S. by approximately 20%..  Systems revenue increased to $232.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2012 from $199.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2011 primarily due to higher da Vinci system unit sales and a higher average selling price (“ASP”). We sold 155 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared with 133 in the same period last year. The growth in system units reflects sales of 16 systems to Japanese customers compared to 6 systems in the same period last year and a greater number of systems sold to U.S. customers; partially offset by 5 fewer systems sold to European customers. The da Vinci system ASP was $1.49 million during the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared with $1.46 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011, driven primarily by product mix as system sales during the three months ended September 30, 2012 contained a higher proportion of Firefly Fluorescence Imaging configurations, which have higher prices than standard HD vision configurations.  Product revenue was $1,317.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared with $1,057.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011.  Instruments and accessories revenue increased 29% to $649.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared with $504.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. Instrument and accessory revenue growth was driven by approximately 25% higher da Vinci surgical procedure volume and revenue generated from initial sales of new instrument and accessory products, including da Vinci Single-Site, Firefly, and the EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer prior to first cases being completed. Overall procedure growth was led by U.S. gynecologic procedures, driven by dVH, Sacrocolpopexy, Endometriosis Resection, and Myomectomy; U.S. general surgery growth, driven by Cholecystectomy and colon procedures; and dVP growth in international markets partially offset by a decline in dVP in the U.S.  Systems revenue increased to $668.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 from $552.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 primarily due to higher da Vinci system unit sales and a higher average selling price (“ASP”). We sold 445 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared with 382 in the same period last year. The da Vinci system ASP was $1.49 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared with $1.43 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, driven primarily by product mix as system sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 contained a higher proportion of surgical simulator, and Firefly Fluorescence Imaging configurations, which have higher prices than standard HD vision configurations and favorable geographical mix.  Service Revenue  Service revenue, comprised primarily of system service and customer training, increased 22% to $87.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012 compared with $71.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011 and increased 24% to $252.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared with $203.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. We typically enter into multi-year, fixed revenue system service contracts at the time systems are sold. The large majority of these service contracts have been renewed at the end of the initial contract periods. Higher service revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 was primarily driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems.  Gross Profit  Product gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2012 increased 19% to $330.7 million, or 73.5% of product revenue, compared with $278.7 million, or 74.3% of product revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2011. Product gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 increased 23% to $963.6 million, or 73.1% of product revenue, compared with $783.0 million, or 74.0% of product revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The higher 2012 product gross profit was driven by higher product revenue, as described above. The slightly lower 2012 product gross profit percentage primarily reflects the introduction of newly launched products possessing lower margins at their introduction point, particularly da Vinci Single-Site     21    Table of Contents  Instruments and the EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer, and higher charges taken for inventory. Margins on newly launched products will typically be lower than our mature products reflecting vendor pricing on low volumes, temporary tooling costs and other start-up costs. Over time as volumes increase, and we refine the manufacturing processes and products, we would expect to see improvement in the margins of these newer products. However, gross margins may ultimately differ for these newer products relative to our previous products based on the volume and complexity of the product. Product gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 reflected stock-based compensation expense of $4.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Product gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 reflected stock-based compensation expense of $10.6 million and $9.2 million, respectively.  Service gross profit during the three months ended September 30, 2012 was $59.4 million, or 67.7% of service revenue, compared with $46.8 million, or 65.2% of service revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2011. Service gross profit during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was $168.8 million, or 67.0% of service revenue, compared with $127.9 million, or 63.0% of service revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The higher 2012 service gross profit was driven by a larger installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems. The higher 2012 gross service profit percentage was primarily driven by reduced service parts consumption rates. Service gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 reflected stock-based compensation expense of $4.1 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Service gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 reflected stock-based compensation expense of $9.6 million and $8.2 million, respectively.  In the past, annual stock option awards were granted on February 15th (or the next business day if February 15th was not a business day). These stock option awards typically vested 1/8 at the end of six months and 1/48 per month thereafter through a four-year period and had a ten-year term. Beginning 2012, stock options have been awarded bi-annually on February 15th and August 15th (or the next business day if the date is not a business day). The February 15th stock option awards are subjected to a four-year vesting period, while the August 15th stock option awards are subjected to a 3.5-year vesting period, with 7/48 vesting at the end of one month and 1/48 per month thereafter. As a result of this change in option grant practice our stock-based compensation in the first and second quarters of 2012 was $34.4 million and $33.3 million compared to $47.3 million in the third quarter. As of September 30, 2012, all of the quarterly timing differences related to our revised 2012 employee grant process have cycled through.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, proctoring expenses, tradeshow expenses, regulatory fees, and general corporate expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2012 increased 16% to $129.0 million compared with $111.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 increased 18% to $374.1 million compared with $316.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase in absolute dollars was due to stock-based compensation expenses, organizational growth to support our expanding business, particularly in the clinical field sales function, higher commissions related to higher revenue levels. Stock-based compensation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 were approximately $28.2 million and $21.4 million, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 were approximately $69.7 million and $63.0 million, respectively.  Please refer to our stock option grant practice discussion in the Gross Profit section above for information on the increase of our stock-based compensation expense in the third quarter of 2012.  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development (“R&D”) costs are expensed as incurred. R&D expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. These enhancements represent significant improvements to our products.  R&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2012 increased 40% to $49.7 million compared with $35.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011. R&D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 increased 30% to $128.3 million compared with $98.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by higher stock-based compensation expense, higher prototype costs and growth in our organization. Prototype costs vary by quarter to quarter due to product development life cycles. Amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property during the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 were $3.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 were $9.8 million and $10.2 million, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 were approximately $10.7 million and $7.4 million, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 were approximately $25.1 million and $21.4 million, respectively. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in R&D and anticipate that R&D expense, including co-development arrangements with industry partners, will continue to increase in the future.    22    Table of Contents Please refer to our stock option grant practice discussion in the Gross Profit section above for information on the increase of our stock-based compensation expense in the third quarter of 2012.  Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net  Interest and other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 was $4.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively. This was driven by higher interest income resulting from lower rates earned on higher cash and investment balances and offset by lower other non-operating gains.  Interest and other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was $12.1 million compared with $11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. This was driven by higher interest income resulting from lower rates earned on higher cash and investment balances. Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2012 was $32.4 million, or 15.0% of pre-tax income, compared with $58.4 million, or 32.3% of pre-tax income for the three months ended September 30, 2011. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was $160.4 million, or 25% of pre-tax income, compared with $162.7 million, or 32.1% of pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. Our effective tax rates for all these periods differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the effect of income earned by certain of our overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate partially offset by state income taxes and non-deductible stock option expenses. We intend to indefinitely reinvest all of our undistributed foreign earnings outside the United States. The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 reflected discrete benefits of $35.1 million primarily associated with the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits in connection with the expiration of certain statutes of limitations in multiple jurisdictions and $2.5 million associated with the filing of our 2011 federal tax returns The income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 also included a discrete recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of new IRS guidance issued in the first quarter of 2012.  As of September 30, 2012, we had total gross unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $81.1 million compared with approximately $98.1 million as of December 31, 2011, representing a net decrease of approximately $17.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. The net decrease is primarily related to the reversal of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $41.2 million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations in multiple jurisdictions, and the release of reserves due to re-evaluation of certain previously unrecognized tax positions as a result of new IRS guidance issued in February 2012, partially offset by increases during the first nine months of 2012 related to other uncertain tax positions. Of the total gross unrecognized tax benefits, $76.8 million and $93.8 million as of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate in the period of recognition. Gross interest related to unrecognized tax benefit accrued was approximately $4.0 million and $7.9 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, representing a decrease of $3.9 million related to the expiration of statutes of limitations, net with increase related to other unrecognized tax positions.  We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Generally, years before 2009 are closed for our most significant jurisdictions except for certain states, for which all years since inception remain open due to utilization of net operating losses and R&D credits generated in prior years or longer statutes of limitations. Certain of our unrecognized tax benefits could reverse based on the normal expiration of various statutes of limitations, which could affect our effective tax rate in the period in which they reverse.    23    Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Sources and Uses of Cash  Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents plus short and long-term investments increased from $2.2 billion at December 31, 2011 to $2.7 billion at September 30, 2012. Cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing and financing needs.  As of September 30, 2012, $418.8 million of our cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. We currently have no plans to repatriate any foreign earnings back to the U.S. as we believe our cash flows provided by our U.S. operations will meet our U.S. liquidity needs.  Consolidated Cash Flow Data (unaudited) (in millions)                    Nine Months        Ended September 30,        2012     2011     Net cash provided by (used in):        Operating activities   $ 597.0     $ 463.9     Investing activities     (712.6 )      (340.6 )    Financing activities     46.1       (105.3 )    Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents     (0.1 )      0.4                           Net decrease (increase) in cash and cash equivalents   $ (69.6 )    $ 18.4                          Operating Activities  For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, cash flow from operations of $597.0 million exceeded our net income of $481.7 million for two primary reasons:        1. Our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, depreciation and accretion of discounts on investments. These non-cash charges totaled $162.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2012.        2. Cash used in working capital and other assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was approximately $46.7 million.  Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other liabilities. Accounts receivable increased by $34.8 million or 13% during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 reflecting timing of our system sales. Inventory increased by $11.4 million or 12% during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 primarily due to our business growth and expanded product offerings. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities decreased by $11.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 primarily due to the payments of 2011 incentive compensation and the purchase of stock by employees under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. Deferred revenue increased by $16.3 million or 11% due to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist.    24    Table of Contents For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, cash flow from operations of $463.9 million exceeded our net income of $343.9 million for two primary reasons:        1. Our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, and depreciation. These non-cash charges totaled $135.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2011.        2. Cash used in working capital and other assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was approximately $31.3 million.  Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other liabilities. Accounts receivable increased by $18.2 million or 7% during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 reflecting timing of system sales. Inventory increased by $21.8 million or 25% during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 due to our business growth, expanded product offerings, and safety stock acquired for key components. Deferred revenue increased $17.7 million, or 14% during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 due to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist.  Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 consisted of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $616.9 million, purchase of property and equipment, intellectual property and business of $68.1 million, including the increase in acquisition-related restricted cash. Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 consisted primarily of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $272.9 million and property, plant and equipment and acquisitions of intellectual property of $67.7 million. The $67.7 million of property, plant and equipment and acquisitions of intellectual property includes $33.1 million in cash used when we completed our purchase of land and buildings near our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. We invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits and money market funds. We are not a capital intensive business.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $176.5 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $54.7 million, offset by $185.1 million used in the repurchase of approximately 372,155 shares of our common stock through open market transactions. Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 consisted primarily of $331.8 million for the repurchase of approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock through open market transactions, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $181.6 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $44.9 million.  Our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption and acceptance of our products. Based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.    25    Table of Contents   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  There have been no material changes in our market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.      ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  From time to time, we may be involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings relating to securities laws, product liability, patent infringement, contract disputes and other matters relating to various claims that arise in the normal course of our business. Certain of these lawsuits are described in further detail below. We do not know whether we will prevail in these matters nor can we assure that any remedy could be reached on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Based on currently available information, we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these actions and that the resolution of these cases is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or future results of operations. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.  Purported Shareholder Class Action Lawsuit filed August 6, 2010  On August 6, 2010, a purported class action lawsuit entitled Perlmutter v. Intuitive Surgical et al., No. CV10-3451, was filed against us and seven of our current and former officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock between February 1, 2008 and January 7, 2009. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making allegedly false and misleading statements and omitting certain material facts in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On February 15, 2011, the Police Retirement System of St. Louis was appointed Lead Plaintiff in the case pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. An amended complaint was filed on April 15, 2011, making allegations    26    Table of Contents  substantially similar to the allegations described above. On May 23, 2011, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On August 10, 2011 that motion was granted and the action was dismissed; the plaintiffs were given 30 days to file an amended complaint. On September 12, 2011, plaintiffs filed their amended complaint. The allegations contained therein are substantially similar to the allegations in the prior complaint. We filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. A hearing occurred on February 16, 2012, and on May 22, 2012 the Company’s motion was granted. The complaint was dismissed with prejudice, and a final judgment was entered in the Company’s favor on June 1, 2012. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on June 20, 2012. That appeal remains pending.  Purported Derivative Actions  On August 19, 2010, an alleged shareholder caused a purported shareholder’s derivative lawsuit entitled Himmel v. Smith et al., No. 1-10-CV-180416, to be filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of Santa Clara naming us as a nominal defendant, and naming 14 of our current and former officers and directors as defendants. The lawsuit seeks to recover, for our benefit, unspecified damages purportedly sustained by us in connection with allegedly misleading statements and/or omissions made in connection with our financial reporting for the period between February 1, 2008 and January 7, 2009. It also seeks a series of changes to our corporate governance policies and an award of attorney’s fees. On September 15, 2010, another purported shareholder filed an essentially identical lawsuit entitled Applebaum v. Guthart et al., No. 1-10-CV-182645, in the same court against 15 of our current and former officers and directors. On October 5, 2010, the court ordered that the two cases be consolidated for all purposes. By agreement with the plaintiffs, all activity in the case has been stayed pending the results of the appeal in the purported shareholder class action lawsuit discussed above.      ITEM 1A.
