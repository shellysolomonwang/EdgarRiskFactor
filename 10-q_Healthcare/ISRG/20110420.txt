Item 1A: Risk Factors”. Our actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.  Intuitive®, Intuitive Surgical®, da Vinci®, da Vinci S®, da Vinci® S HD Surgical System, da Vinci® Si, da Vinci® Si-e HD Surgical SystemTM, EndoWrist®, Single-SiteTM, DVSTATTM and InSite® are trademarks of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.    16    Table of Contents Overview  Products. We design, manufacture and market da Vinci Surgical Systems, which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery. We believe that this new generation of surgery, which we call da Vinci surgery, is a significant advancement similar in scope to previous generations of surgery—open surgery and minimally invasive surgery, or conventional MIS. The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeon’s console, or consoles, a patient-side cart and a high performance vision system. The da Vinci Surgical System translates the surgeon’s natural hand movements, which are performed on instrument controls at a console, into corresponding micro-movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small incisions, or ports. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical System provides the surgeon with intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and high definition 3-D vision, while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of MIS.  By placing computer-enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to deliver higher value minimally invasive surgical procedures to their patients. We model patient value as equal to: procedure efficacy / invasiveness. Here procedure efficacy is a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is how disruptive and painful the treatment is itself. When the patient value of robotic surgery is significantly higher than competing treatment options, we have seen that patients will seek out surgeons and hospitals that offer da Vinci procedures, potentially resulting in a local shift of treatment approach and market share. The combination of these local adoptions can drive a disruptive change in the marketplace and can lead to the broad adoption of robotic surgery. These adoptions occur procedure by procedure, and are driven by the relative patient value of da Vinci procedures against alternatives for the same disease state.  Business Model. In our business model, we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, derived from sales of instruments, accessories, and service. The da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for between $1.0 million and $2.3 million, depending on configuration and geography, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. We then generate recurring revenue as our customers consume our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da Vinci Surgical System. EndoWrist instruments and accessories have a limited life and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery, at which point they are replaced. We also generate recurring revenue from ongoing system service. We typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold. These service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period, typically at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $170,000 per year, depending on the configuration of the underlying system.  Recurring revenue has generally grown at a faster rate than system revenue. Recurring revenue increased from $419.6 million or 48% of total revenue in 2008, to $561.7 million, or 53% of total revenue in 2009 to $752.7 million, or 53% of total revenue in 2010. Recurring revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was $221.0 million, or 57% of total revenue. The increase in recurring revenue relative to system revenue reflects continuing adoption of procedures on a growing base of installed da Vinci Surgical Systems. We expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future. The installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown to 1,840 at March 31, 2011, compared with 1,752 at December 31, 2010 and 1,482 at March 31, 2010.  Regulatory Activities  We believe that we have obtained the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States. As we make additions to target procedures, we will continue to seek the necessary clearances. The following table lists chronologically our FDA clearances to date:        •    July 2000—General laparoscopic procedures        •    March 2001—Non-cardiac thoracoscopic procedures        •    May 2001—Prostatectomy procedures        •    November 2002—Cardiotomy procedures        •    July 2004—Cardiac revascularization procedures    17    Table of Contents     •    March 2005—Urologic surgical procedures        •    April 2005—Gynecologic surgical procedures        •    June 2005—Pediatric surgical procedures        •    December 2009—Transoral Otolaryngologic surgical procedures  During the first quarter of 2009, we received clearance to market our da Vinci Si Surgical System in the United States and Europe.  In November 2009, we received regulatory (Shonin) approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) for our da Vinci S System in Japan. During the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 we sold 5 and 7 da Vinci S Systems, respectively, in Japan. These sales were primarily made to early adopters. We are currently focusing our efforts on obtaining specific reimbursement for da Vinci procedures in Japan. If we are not successful in obtaining the necessary reimbursement approvals or obtaining approvals for future products and procedures, then the demand of our products could be limited. We have partnered with the experienced regulatory team from Johnson & Johnson K.K. Medical Company (Japan) in our Japanese regulatory process and are continuing to work with them to meet government requirements. We have partnered with Adachi Co., LTD as our separate independent distribution partner in Japan who is responsible for marketing, selling, and servicing our products in Japan. The recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan and their aftermath have created significant economic uncertainty in that country. Sales to customers located in Japan represented approximately 1% of our product revenue in 2010. Since the earthquake, we have noticed a significant drop in commercial activity in Japan, and we believe economic activity in the country may be disrupted for a substantial period of time. As a result, our sales in Japan may be adversely affected. Given the relatively small proportion of our total revenue coming from Japanese customers, we do not expect the overall impact on our revenues resulting from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan to be material. However, we do expect demand for our products in Japan, for the remainder of 2011 to be further curtailed as government health spending resources are redeployed into more immediately critical areas. At this time, we do not believe that we face any critical inventory supply issues related to Japanese sourced components.  2011 Business Events and Trends  Economic Environment. During the first half of 2009, the world-wide economic recession curtailed capital purchases of our da Vinci Surgical Systems. Beginning in the second half of 2009 through this first quarter of 2011, the U.S. economy has been recovering slowly. U.S. demand for da Vinci systems began improving during the second half of fiscal 2009 and has been relatively steady in recent quarters. Demand for da Vinci systems in Europe has recovered more slowly than in the U.S. Demand for da Vinci systems fluctuates quarter to quarter based upon changing economic and geopolitical impacts. The 120 total da Vinci Surgical Systems sold in the three months ended March 31, 2011 exceeded those sold during the same period of 2010 by 16 systems.  da Vinci Si Surgical System Market Acceptance. During the second quarter of 2009 we launched our newest da Vinci model, the da Vinci Si. The da Vinci Si Surgical System was FDA approved and CE marked upon launch and is currently available in most countries in Europe and Asia, other than Japan. da Vinci Si Systems are available with an option to purchase a second console. Existing da Vinci S instruments and most da Vinci S accessories, excluding endoscopes and drapes, are compatible with the da Vinci Si system. The da Vinci S System can be upgraded to the da Vinci Si System, however, most customers have chosen to trade-out their da Vinci S System rather than upgrade. We will continue to sell, service and support the da Vinci S Surgical System. Our sales of the standard da Vinci Surgical System have substantially ended; however, we will continue to service and support this product line.    18    Table of Contents Market acceptance of the da Vinci Si Surgical System has been positive since its market introduction in the first quarter of 2009. During the three months ended March 31, 2011, 113 out of 120 systems sold were da Vinci Si models, representing approximately 94% of system sales.  In the third quarter of 2010, we introduced the new Si-e model of the da Vinci Surgical System. The 3-arm Si-e System is designed to deliver core da Vinci functionality, providing a flexible, capable and economical solution for many robotic-assisted procedures. The da Vinci Si-e system is fully upgradeable to the da Vinci Si model by adding a fourth arm (third instrument arm), and other enhancements. During the three months ended March 31, 2011, we sold 3 da Vinci Si-e systems.  da Vinci Skills Simulator. In the first quarter of 2011, we began shipping the da Vinci Skills Simulator. The simulator is a practice tool for the da Vinci Si Surgical System that gives a user the opportunity to practice in his or her facility with the surgeon console controls. The simulator incorporates three-dimensional, physics-based computer simulation technology to immerse the user within a virtual environment. The user navigates through the environment and completes exercises by controlling virtual instruments from the surgeon console. The suite of exercises includes novice, intermediate, and advanced levels. Upon completion of a skills exercise, the simulator provides a quantitative assessment of user performance based on a variety of task-specific metrics. The Skills Simulator is intended to augment, not replace, existing training programs for the da Vinci Si Surgical System.  da Vinci Single-Site instruments. In February 2011 we received the CE mark for our da Vinci Single-Site instrument kit and began selling these new products into Europe. Single-Site is a set of instruments and accessories that allow da Vinci Si systems to work through a single incision rather than three incisions. Single incision surgery is intended to minimize trauma to patients by reducing the number of ports required to enter the body. Single site surgery today is typically performed with modified laparoscopic instruments. Early clinical results with manual instruments have been encouraging, however, manual single incision surgery is challenging due to a difficult user interface and the requirement to manage collisions in a small space near the patient. Single-Site instruments and accessories are designed to avoid collisions at the patient while the surgeon operates them from the surgeon’s console with Intuitive control. The initial Single-Site procedures performed to date have been cholecystectomies. Single-site instruments and accessories are not yet FDA cleared for sale in the U.S. The FDA has requested additional clinical information which we will submit once collected. We intend to furnish clinical data collected from our European customers.  da Vinci Fluorescence Imaging. During the three months ended March 31, 2011 we launched our new da Vinci Fluorescence Imaging product. This new accessory offering combines fluorescent dye with a specialized da Vinci endoscope and illuminator to allow surgeons to see vasculature in three dimensions beneath tissue surfaces to assess blood flow and other conditions that cannot be seen with direct imaging. The fluorescent images integrate seamlessly into the da Vinci surgeon console, providing the surgeon with real time images. We believe that da Vinci Fluorescence Imaging will enable surgeons to work with more confidence and precision in several procedures, potentially including partial nephrectomy and rectal resections.    19    Table of Contents Procedure Adoption  We believe the adoption of da Vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure, and is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value. The value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes, less surgical trauma, or both.  An increasing body of peer reviewed literature has indicated that many of our targeted procedures offer improved clinical outcomes compared to traditional open surgery. For example, da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) offers less surgical and post-surgical morbidity and da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH) offers increased lymph node retrieval counts and a significant reduction in blood transfusions. For most patients, a minimally invasive approach using the da Vinci Surgical System offers reduced pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, reduced post-operative complications and a quicker return to normal daily activities when compared to open surgery.  In 2010, approximately 278,000 surgical procedures were performed with the da Vinci Surgical System, up approximately 35% compared to 2009. The growth in our overall procedure volume was driven primarily by: dVH in the U.S., dVP outside the U.S. and follow-on procedures in the Urology and Gynecology categories (Partial Nephrectomy, Sacralcolpopexy, Myomectomy, Cystectomy, Pyeloplasty) in the U.S. Total da Vinci surgical procedures for the three months ended March 31, 2011 grew by approximately 30% compared with the three months ended March 31, 2010.  During 2010, dVH became our highest volume procedure, surpassing dVP. dVH procedure volume grew from approximately 69,000 cases in 2009 to approximately 110,000 cases in 2010. The very large majority of our 2010 dVH volume came from the U.S. market, where we estimate the total annual addressable robotic market to be approximately 300,000 to 350,000 cases, of which about 50,000 are for cancer.  dVP procedure volume grew from approximately 90,000 cases in 2009 to approximately 98,000 cases worldwide in 2010. The large majority of the approximately 85,000 prostatectomies performed each year in the U.S. are done robotically with the da Vinci Surgical System. 2010 U.S. dVP volume was essentially flat, with the majority of our 2010 worldwide dVP growth coming from European markets.  Other procedures (non-dVH/dVP) grew over 50% in 2010. Growth in these other da Vinci procedures is comprised of follow-on procedures such as da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy in Urology and da Vinci Sacralcopopexy in Gynecology as well as other procedures, which we term emerging procedures. Emerging procedures are earlier in their development, such as da Vinci Transoral Robotic Surgery (dVTORS) in head and neck surgery. While early results in emerging procedures are encouraging and may point to significant patient value, their growth is off of a small absolute base and their future growth rates are uncertain.    20    Table of Contents As we increase our penetratation into benign dVH and other benign conditions, our procedure volumes are likely to reflect more seasonality as patients have more short-term flexibility regarding when these procedures are performed. Historically, we have experienced relatively lower procedure counts in the first quarter, as insurance deductibles are reset, and the third quarter, attributable to vacation season, especially in Europe. The fourth quarter has historically been the seasonally strongest procedure quarter, as more insurance deductibles are met. Timing of procedures and changes in procedure growth directly affect the timing of instruments and accessory purchases and capital purchases.  Technology Acquisitions  We continue to make several strategic acquisitions of intellectual property and related technologies. Total investments in intellectual property and related technologies during the three months ended March 31, 2011 were $5.0 million, compared to $3.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2010. Amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 were $4.4 million and $3.9 million, respectively.  First Quarter 2011 Financial Highlights        •    Total revenue increased to $388.1 million, or 18%, during the three months ended March 31, 2011 from $328.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2010.        •    da Vinci procedures performed during the three months ended March 31, 2011 were up approximately 30% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2010.        •    Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $157.4 million, or 28%, during the three months ended March 31, 2011 from $122.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2010.        •    Recurring revenue increased to $221.0 million, or 28%, during the three months ended March 31, 2011, representing 57% of total revenue from $173.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2010, representing 53% of total revenue.        •    We sold 120 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the three months ended March 31, 2011, compared with 104 during the three months ended March 31, 2010.        •    System revenue increased to $167.1 million, or 8%, during the three months ended March 31, 2011 from $155.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2010.        •    As of March 31, 2011, we had a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of 1,840 systems, 1,344 in the United States, 330 in Europe, and 166 in the rest of the world.        •    We added 69 employees during the three months ended March 31, 2011, of which the majority were in field sales, service, training, and product operations, bringing our total headcount to 1,729 as of March 31, 2011.        •    Operating income increased to $148.3 million, or 14%, during the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to $129.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2010. Operating income included $32.1 million and $26.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock programs.        •    As of March 31, 2011, we had $1,757.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased by $148.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011 driven by cash flow from operations and $59.5 million generated from employee stock programs offset by $11.6 million of share repurchases.    21    Table of Contents Results of Operations  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income information (in millions, except percentages):                            Three months Ended March 31,        2011     % of totalrevenue     2010     % of totalrevenue     Revenue:                       Product   $ 324.5       84 %    $ 278.0       85 %    Service     63.6       16 %      50.6       15 %                                      Total revenue     388.1       100 %      328.6       100 %                                      Cost of revenue:                       Product     84.8       22 %      68.0       21 %    Service     24.5       6 %      20.1       6 %                                      Total cost of revenue     109.3       28 %      88.1       27 %                                      Products gross profit     239.7       62 %      210.0       64 %    Services gross profit     39.1       10 %      30.5       9 %                                      Gross profit     278.8       72 %      240.5       73 %                                      Operating expenses:                       Selling, general, and administrative     99.1       26 %      82.8       25 %    Research and development     31.4       8 %      28.0       9 %                                      Total operating expenses     130.5       34 %      110.8       34 %                                      Income from operations     148.3       38 %      129.7       39 %    Interest and other income, net     5.3       2 %      4.1       2 %                                      Income before taxes     153.6       40 %      133.8       41 %    Income tax expense     49.5       13 %      48.5       15 %                                      Net income   $ 104.1       27 %    $ 85.3       26 %                                    Total Revenue  Total revenue was $388.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to $328.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010. Revenue growth for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci surgery, driving higher system and recurring revenue. We believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure. Our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in our target procedures. dVH and dVP are our two largest procedures, representing more than 70% of our total procedures over the past several years. An increasing body of peer reviewed literature has indicated that many of our targeted procedures offer improved clinical outcomes compared to traditional open surgery. For example, dVP offers less surgical and post-surgical morbidity and dVH offers increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion. For most patients, a minimally invasive approach using the da Vinci Surgical System offers reduced pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, reduced post-operative complications and a quicker return to normal daily activities when compared to open surgery.  Revenue within the United States accounted for 77% and 79% of total revenue for the three month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We believe domestic revenue has accounted for the large majority of total revenue primarily due to more rapid procedure adoption in the United States, driven by the ability of patients to choose their provider and method of treatment. For the three months ended March 31, 2011, international revenue grew as a percentage of total revenue compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher European sales driven by increased dVP penetration in Europe.    22    Table of Contents The following table summarizes our revenue and da Vinci Surgical System unit sales for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 (in millions, except percentages and unit sales):                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2011     2010     Revenue             Instruments and accessories   $ 157.4     $ 122.7     Systems     167.1       155.3                       Total product revenue     324.5       278.0     Services     63.6       50.6                       Total revenue   $ 388.1     $ 328.6                       Recurring revenue   $ 221.0     $ 173.3                       % of total revenue     57 %      53 %    Domestic   $ 297.2     $ 260.2     International     90.9       68.4                       Total revenue   $ 388.1     $ 328.6                       % of Revenue - Domestic     77 %      79 %    % of Revenue - International     23 %      21 %        Domestic Unit Sales     89       80     International Unit Sales     31       24                       Total Unit Sales     120       104                     Product Revenue  Product revenue was $324.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared with $278.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010.  Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $157.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared with $122.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The increase in revenue of 28% was driven by an increase in procedures performed of 30%.  Systems revenue increased to $167.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011 from $155.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2010 primarily due to higher da Vinci system unit sales, partially offset by a lower average selling price (ASP). We sold 120 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the three months ended March 31, 2011, compared with 104 in the same period last year. 113 of the 120 systems sold during the three months ended March 31, 2011 were the da Vinci Si Surgical Systems. 13 standard and 19 da Vinci S Surgical Systems were traded in as part of da Vinci Si purchase transactions during the three months ended March 31, 2011, compared with 17 standard systems traded in during the same period last year. Prior to the fourth quarter 2010, transactions involving customers transitioning from da Vinci S to a da Vinci Si system were included in upgrade revenue and excluded from the system count. Our present treatment reflects the current nature of the higher-priced transactions where customers are now shipped completely new da Vinci Si systems in exchange for their used da Vinci S systems, rather than receiving component level field upgrades of their da Vinci S units. Revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2010 included $5 million of da Vinci S to da Vinci Si upgrade revenue. The da Vinci system ASP was $1.38 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011, resulting primarily from the higher proportion of system sales involving trade-ins, and the associated credits for the returned units. Secondary factors contributing to the lower ASP for the three months ended March 31, 2011 were a lower Euro exchange rate on euro-denominated system sales and regional mix. In addition, revenue of approximately $1.3 million related to da Vinci Skills Simulators, sold largely in connection with new system sales during the three months ended March 31, 2011, were deferred since they were not shipped prior to March 31, 2011. System upgrade revenue was $1.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to $5.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2010.     23    Table of Contents Service Revenue  Service revenue, comprised primarily of system service and customer training, increased 26% to $63.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared with $50.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010. We typically enter into system service contracts at the time systems are sold. These service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service period. Higher service revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2011 was primarily driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems.  Gross Profit  Product gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2011 increased 14% to $239.7 million, or 73.9% of product revenue, compared with $210.0 million, or 75.5% of product revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The higher 2011 product gross profit was driven by higher product revenue, as described above. The lower 2011 product gross profit percentage primarily reflects the lower average system selling price as previously described and higher first quarter reserves taken for excess inventory.  Service gross profit during the three months ended March 31, 2011 was $39.1 million, or 61.5% of service revenue, compared with $30.5 million, or 60.3% of service revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2010. The higher 2011 service gross profit was driven by higher service revenue, as described above. The higher 2011 gross service profit percentage was driven by lower first quarter 2011 field upgrade costs.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, proctoring expenses, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2011 increased 20% to $99.1 million compared with $82.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The increase was due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, particularly in our clinical sales team, higher commissions related to higher revenue levels, and increased stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses were approximately $20.2 million and $17.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.    24    Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. These enhancements represent significant improvements to our products.  Research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2011 increased 12% to $31.4 million compared with $28.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The increase was driven by the growth in our research and development organization and higher stock compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expense charged to research and development expenses were $6.6 million and $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property during the three months ended March 31, 2011 was $4.2 million compared to $3.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2010. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expense, including co-development arrangements with industry partners, will continue to increase in the future.  Interest and Other Income, Net  Interest and other income, net for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was $5.3 million compared with $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010. Higher interest and other income, net for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was driven by $1.7 million of capital gains realized on the sale of equity securities, partially offset by lower interest income resulting from lower rates earned on cash and investment balances during the three months ended March 31, 2011.  Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was $49.5 million, or 32.2% of pre-tax income, compared with $48.5 million, or 36.2% of pre-tax income for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2011 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the effect of income earned by certain of our overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate, partially offset by state income taxes and non deductible stock option expenses. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2010 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible stock option expenses, partially offset by the effect of income earned by certain of our overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate. We intend these foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The decrease in effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared with the three months ended March 31, 2010 is primarily related to the decrease in California tax after the adoption of single sales factor apportionment effective January 1, 2011, and an increase in foreign earnings taxed at lower rates relative to domestic income.  As of March 31, 2011, we had total gross unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $82.8 million compared with approximately $78.9 million as of December 31, 2010, representing an increase of approximately $3.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011. Of the total gross unrecognized tax benefits, $78.5 million and $74.7 million as of March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. Gross interest related to unrecognized tax benefit accrued was approximately $6.1 million and $5.5 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.  We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For U.S. federal and California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations currently remain open for all years since inception due to utilization of net operating losses and R&D credits generated in prior years.    25    Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Sources and Uses of Cash  Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents plus short and long-term investments increased from $1,609 million at December 31, 2010 to $1,757 million at March 31, 2011. Cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing and financing needs.  Consolidated Cash Flow Data (unaudited)                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2011     2010        (in millions)     Net cash provided by (used in)        Operating activities   $ 100.3     $ 115.6     Investing activities     7.3       (147.6 )    Financing activities     61.6       124.7     Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents     0.8       (0.5 )                      Net increase in cash and cash equivalents   $ 170.0     $ 92.2                     Operating Activities  For the three months ended March 31, 2011, cash flow from operations of $100.3 million was less than our net income of $104.1 million for two primary reasons:        1. Our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, and depreciation. These non-cash charges totaled $49.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011.        2. Cash used in working capital and other assets during the three months ended March 31, 2011 was approximately $53.3 million.  Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other liabilities. Accounts receivable increased by $13.1 million or 5% during the three months ended March 31, 2011 reflecting timing of system sales. The increase in inventory by $6.5 million or 7% during the three months ended March 31, 2011 reflects steps taken to increase component inventory where supplies have tightened and a build of finished goods as we prepare to move our manufacturing operations to our new building in Sunnyvale. Prepaid and other assets increased by $18.3 million or 79% during the three months ended March 31, 2011 primarily due to payment of estimated taxes. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities decreased by $20.1 million or 9% during the three months ended March 31, 2011 primarily due to the payments of 2010 incentive compensation and the purchase of stock by employees under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) during the three months ended March 31, 2011.  For the three months ended March 31, 2010, cash flow from operations of $115.6 million exceeded our net income of $85.3 million for two primary reasons:        1. Our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, and depreciation. These non-cash charges totaled $36.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2010.        2. Cash used in working capital and other assets during the three months ended March 31, 2010 was approximately $6.1 million.    26    Table of Contents Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other liabilities. Accounts receivable decreased by $25.2 million or 12% during the three months ended March 31, 2010 reflecting timing of system sales. Inventory increased by $10.9 million or 19% during the three months ended March 31, 2010 reflecting below optimal quantities at December 31, 2009. Prepaid and other assets increased by $20.6 million or 96% during the three months ended March 31, 2010 primarily due to payment of estimated taxes. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased by $3.6 million or 2% during the three months ended March 31, 2010 primarily due to the payments of 2009 incentive compensation, and the purchase of stock by employees under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) during the three months ended March 31, 2010.  Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2011 consisted proceeds from sales of investments (net of purchases of investments) of $22 million, and capital expenditures and acquisitions of intellectual property of $14.7 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2010 consisted primarily of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $131.4 million, capital expenditures and acquisitions of intellectual property of $16.2 million. We invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds. We are not a capital intensive business.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2011 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $59.5 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $13.7 million, offset by $11.6 million for the repurchase of approximately 36,000 shares of our common stock through open market transactions. Net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2010 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $92.5 million.  Our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption and acceptance of our products. Based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.    27    Table of Contents   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  There have been no material changes in our market risk during the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.      ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.    28    Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  We are involved in various ordinary and routine legal proceedings and disputes that arise in the normal course of business. These matters include product liability actions, patent infringement actions, contract disputes, and other matters. We do not know whether we will prevail in these matters nor can we assure that any remedy could be reached on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Based on currently available information, we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these actions and that the resolution of these cases is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or future results of operations. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. There have been no material developments to the legal proceedings disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.  From time to time, we may be involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings relating to securities laws, product liability, patent infringement, contract disputes and other matters relating to various claims that arise in the normal course of our business. Certain of these lawsuits are described in further detail below. We do not know whether we will prevail in these matters nor can we assure that any remedy could be reached on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Based on currently available information, we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these actions and that the resolution of these cases is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or future results of operations.

These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.  Purported Shareholder Class Action Lawsuit filed August 6, 2010  On August 6, 2010, a purported class action lawsuit entitled Perlmutter v. Intuitive Surgical et al., No. CV10-3451, was filed against us and seven of our current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock between February 1, 2008 and January 7, 2009. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making allegedly false and misleading statements and omitting certain material facts in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On February 15, 2011, the Police Retirement System of St. Louis was appointed Lead Plaintiff in the case pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. An amended complaint was filed on April 15, 2011, making allegations substantially similar to the allegations described above.  Purported Derivative Actions  On August 19, 2010, an alleged shareholder caused a purported shareholder’s derivative lawsuit entitled Himmel v. Smith et al., No. 1-10-CV-180416, to be filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of Santa Clara naming us as a nominal defendant, and naming 14 of our current and former officers and directors as defendants. The lawsuit seeks to recover, for the company’s benefit, unspecified damages purportedly sustained by us in connection with allegedly misleading statements and/or omissions made in connection with our financial reporting for the period between February 1, 2008 and January 7, 2009. It also seeks a series of changes to our corporate governance policies and an award of attorney’s fees. On September 15, 2010, another purported shareholder filed an essentially identical lawsuit entitled Applbaum v. Guthart et al., No. 1-10-CV-182645, in the same court against 15 of our current and former officers and directors. On October 5, 2010, the court ordered that the two cases be consolidated for all purposes. By agreement with the plaintiffs, formal discovery has been stayed in the case.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  There have been no changes to the Risk Factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, except for the following:  NATURAL OR OTHER DISASTERS COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULT IN LOSS OF REVENUE OR IN HIGHER EXPENSES.  Natural disasters, terrorist activities and other business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. For example, the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan and their aftermath have created significant economic uncertainty in that country. Since the earthquake, we have noticed a significant drop in commercial activity in Japan, and we believe economic activity in the country may be disrupted for a substantial period of time. As a result, our sales in Japan may be adversely affected. In addition, we expect demand for our products in Japan for the remainder of 2011 to be further curtailed as government health spending resources are redeployed into more immediately critical areas.  Our corporate headquarters and many of our operations are located in California, a seismically active region. A natural disaster in any of our major markets in North America or Europe could have a material adverse impact on our operations, operating results and financial condition. Further, any unanticipated business disruption caused by Internet security threats, damage to global communication networks or otherwise could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.      ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
