Item 1A: Risk Factors”. Our actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.  Intuitive® , Intuitive Surgical®, da Vinci®, da Vinci S®, da Vinci® S HD Surgical System™, da Vinci® Si™, EndoWrist®, and InSite® are trademarks of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.  Overview  Products. We design, manufacture and market da Vinci Surgical Systems, which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery. We believe that this new generation of surgery, which we call da Vinci surgery, is a significant advancement similar in scope to previous generations of surgery—open surgery and minimally invasive surgery, or conventional MIS. The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeon’s console, or consoles, a patient-side cart and a high performance vision system. The da Vinci Surgical System translates the surgeon’s natural hand movements, which are performed on instrument controls at a console, into corresponding micro-movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small incisions, or ports. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical System provides the surgeon with intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and high definition 3-D vision, while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of MIS.  By placing computer-enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to deliver higher value surgical procedures to their patients. We model patient value as equal to: procedure efficacy / invasiveness. Here efficacy is a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is how disruptive and painful the treatment is itself. When the patient value of robotic surgery is significantly higher than competing treatment options, we have seen that patients will seek out surgeons and hospitals that offer da Vinci procedures, resulting in a local shift of treatment approach and market share. The combination of these local adoptions drives a disruptive change in the marketplace and leads to the broad adoption of robotic surgery. These adoptions occur procedure by procedure, and are driven by the relative patient value of da Vinci procedures against alternatives for the same disease state.  Business Model. In our business model, we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, derived from sales of instruments, accessories, and service revenue. The da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for $1.0 million to $2.3 million, depending on configuration and geography, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. We then generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da Vinci Surgical System. EndoWrist instruments and accessories will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery and will need to be replaced as they are consumed. We generate additional recurring revenue from ongoing system service. We typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period, typically at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $180,000 per year, depending on the configuration of the underlying system.    16    Table of Contents Since the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System in 1999, robotic surgery volume has increased and our established base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown. Recurring revenue has grown at an equal or faster rate than system revenue. Recurring revenue increased from $276.4 million, or 46% of total revenue in 2007, to $419.6 million, or 48% of total revenue in 2008 to $561.7 million, or 53% of total revenue in 2009. Recurring revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2010 was $182.9 million or 52% of total revenue and for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $356.2 million, or 52% of total revenue. The increase in recurring revenue relative to system revenue reflects continuing adoption of procedures on a growing base of installed da Vinci Surgical Systems. We expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future. The installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown to 1,571 at June 30, 2010, compared with 1,242 at June 30, 2009 and 1,482 at March 31, 2010.  Regulatory Activities  We believe that we have obtained the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States. As we make additions to target procedures, we will continue to seek the necessary clearances. The following table lists chronologically our FDA clearances to date:        •    July 2000 – General laparoscopic procedures        •    March 2001 – Non-cardiac thoracoscopic procedures        •    May 2001 – Prostatectomy procedures        •    November 2002 – Cardiotomy procedures        •    July 2004 – Cardiac revascularization procedures        •    March 2005 – Urologic surgical procedures        •    April 2005 – Gynecologic surgical procedures        •    June 2005 – Pediatric surgical procedures        •    December 2009 – Transoral Otolaryngologic surgical procedures  During the first quarter of 2009, we received clearance to market our da Vinci Si Surgical System in the United States and Europe.  In November 2009, we received regulatory (Shonin) approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) for our da Vinci S System in Japan. During the three months ended March 31, 2010 and six months ended June 30, 2010, we sold seven and eight da Vinci S Systems, respectively, in Japan. These sales were primarily made to early adopters in Japan who were anticipating our Shonin approval. We are currently focusing our efforts on obtaining the appropriate reimbursement for da Vinci procedures in Japan. If we are not successful in obtaining the necessary reimbursement approvals or obtaining approvals for future products and procedures, then the demand of our products could be limited. We have partnered with the experienced regulatory team from Johnson & Johnson K.K. Medical Company (Japan) in our Japanese regulatory process and are continuing to work with them to meet government requirements. We have partnered with Adachi Co., LTD as our separate independent distribution partner in Japan who is responsible for marketing, selling, and servicing our products in Japan.  2010 Business Events and Trends  Economic Environment. During the first half of 2009, the world-wide economic recession curtailed hospital demand for capital purchases of our da Vinci Surgical Systems. Driven by the U.S. market, demand for our da Vinci Surgical Systems improved towards the end of 2009 and into 2010. The 212 total da Vinci Surgical Systems sold in the six months ended June 30, 2010 exceeded those sold during the same period of 2009 by 70 systems. The increase was primarily in the United States. However, the macro-economic environment in Europe has constrained capital spending such that system sales in the six months ended June 30, 2010 were 25 compared with 30 for the six months ended June 30, 2009 despite significant procedure growth.  da Vinci Si Surgical System Product Launch. During the second quarter of 2009 we launched our newest da Vinci model, the da Vinci Si. The da Vinci Si brings to market three significant innovations. First, our InSite™ imaging system has been substantially redesigned for increased visual acuity and improved ease-of-use. The HD imaging system’s increased performance is similar to the move from 720p to 1080i in commercial television. We believe that the increased visual performance will continue to enhance    17    Table of Contents  surgeon precision and confidence and will contribute to improved patient outcomes and shorter procedure times. Secondly, the da Vinci Si surgeon console’s user interface was redesigned to allow simplified and integrated control of da Vinci products and other operating room devices, such as electro-surgical units. The new user interface also includes a set of ergonomic controls for surgeon comfort. We believe the simplified interface will allow for easier surgeon training. The third significant improvement is the introduction of a dual surgeon’s console for use during surgery, which will allow new methods of training da Vinci surgeons and enable collaborative da Vinci surgery. With the da Vinci Si, a surgeon sitting at a second console can view the same surgery as the primary surgeon and can be passed control of some or all of the da Vinci arms during a case. We believe this will both shorten the learning curve for new surgeons and will allow collaborative surgery in complex cases.  The da Vinci Si Surgical System was FDA approved and CE marked upon launch and is currently available in the United States, Europe, and certain other countries. da Vinci Si Systems are available with an option to purchase a second console. Existing da Vinci S instruments and most da Vinci S accessories are compatible with the da Vinci Si system. An upgrade from a da Vinci S System to the da Vinci Si System is available for our current customers. We will continue to sell, service and support the da Vinci S Surgical System. Our sales of the standard da Vinci Surgical System have substantially ended; however, we will continue to service and support this product line.  We offered certain of our customers who purchased da Vinci S Surgical Systems in the first quarter of 2009 the opportunity to upgrade their recently purchased da Vinci S Surgical Systems to da Vinci Si Surgical Systems at a discount to the list price of our upgrade. The upgrade program also provided our customers the opportunity to return their recently purchased da Vinci S camera accessories and receive a credit towards the purchase of da Vinci Si camera or other accessories. These customers were given until June 30, 2009 to accept our offer. Total revenue in an amount equal to the discount, of approximately $20.1 million, was deferred in the first quarter of 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, we recognized $13.8 million of revenue from offers declined, upgrades completed or accessories delivered. In the third quarter of 2009, we completed all accepted da Vinci Si system upgrade offers and recognized the remaining $6.3 million of deferred revenue.  Market acceptance of the da Vinci Si Surgical System has been positive since its market introduction in the second quarter of 2009. In the second quarter of 2010, 89 out of 108 systems sold were da Vinci Si Surgical Systems, representing approximately 82% of system sales.  Second Quarter 2010 Financial Highlights        •    Second quarter 2010 surgical procedures performed with the da Vinci Surgical System grew by approximately 36% compared to the second quarter of 2009.        •    Second quarter 2010 da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH) procedure volume surpassed da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) volume, becoming the highest volume da Vinci surgery procedure.        •    Total revenue increased to $350.7 million from $260.6 million during the second quarter of 2010. Second quarter 2009 total revenue included recognition of $13.8 million of $20.1 million of revenue deferred in the first quarter of 2009 related to da Vinci Si system upgrade offers made.        •    Recurring revenue increased to $182.9 million from $137.1 million during the second quarter of 2010.

Second quarter 2009 system revenue included recognition of $12.4 million of $18.0 million of revenue deferred in the first quarter of 2009 related to da Vinci Si system upgrade offers made.        •    As of June 30, 2010, we had a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of 1,571 systems, 1,160 in the United States, 276 in Europe, and 135 in the rest of the world.    18    Table of Contents     •    We added 119 employees during the second quarter of 2010, primarily in field sales and product operations functions, bringing our total headcount to 1,476 at June 30, 2010.        •    Operating income was $139.7 million compared to $99.5 million during the second quarter of 2009. Second quarter 2009 operating income included recognition of $13.8 million of $20.1 million related to revenue deferred in the first quarter of 2009 for da Vinci Si system upgrade revenue offers made. Operating income included $30.3 million and $24.6 million during the second quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for the estimated fair value of employee stock options and stock purchases.        •    We ended the second quarter of 2010 with $1,588.2 million in cash and investments. Cash and investments increased by $192.7 million during the second quarter of 2010.  Procedure adoption  We believe the adoption of da Vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure, and is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value. The value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes, less surgical trauma, or both.  The procedures that have driven the most growth in our business recently are the da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH) and da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP). Other gynecologic procedures such as da Vinci Myomectomy and da Vinci Sacral Colpopexy, other urologic procedures such as da Vinci Nephrectomy, da Vinci Cystectomy and da Vinci Pyeloplasty, cardiothoracic procedures such as da Vinci Mitral Valve Repair and da Vinci Revascularization, and da Vinci colorectal procedures have also contributed to our growth. We anticipate total 2010 procedures to grow approximately 35% from approximately 205,000 procedures performed in 2009.

For the six months ended June 30, 2010, revenue increased to $679.3 million from $449.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. Second quarter 2009 total revenue was impacted by recognition of $13.8 million of the $20.1 million of revenue deferred in the first quarter of 2009 related to da Vinci Si system upgrade revenue offers made. Total revenue in the first half of 2009 excluded the remaining unrecognized $6.3 million of revenue in connection with the upgrade offers described above. Revenue growth for the first half of 2010 was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci surgery, driving higher system and recurring revenue. We believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure. Our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in our target procedures. dVH and dVP are our two largest procedures, representing more than 70% of our total procedures over the past several years. An increasing body of peer review literature has indicated that dVP offers superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal, continence, and sexual potency. Favorable clinical results have been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology, which includes increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion. For most patients, a minimally invasive approach using the da Vinci Surgical System offers reduced pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, reduced post-operative complications and a quicker return to normal daily activities.  Revenue within the United States accounted for 82% and 81% of total revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2010, respectively, and 78% and 77% of total revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2009, respectively. We believe domestic revenue accounts for the large majority of total revenue primarily due to the ability of patients to choose their provider and method of treatment. The increase in second quarter and first half 2010 revenue in the United States relative to the rest of the world reflects increased hospital capital spending in the United States and decreased spending in Europe due to the economic environment, compared to the second quarter and first half of 2009.  The following table summarizes our revenue and da Vinci Surgical System unit sales for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 (in millions, except percentages and unit sales):                            Three Months EndedJune 30,     Six Months EndedJune 30,        2010     2009     2010     2009     Revenue                       Instruments and accessories   $ 127.5     $ 95.8     $ 250.2     $ 175.4     Systems     167.8       123.5       323.1       193.0                                       Total product revenue     295.3       219.3       573.3       368.4     Services     55.4       41.3       106.0       80.6                                       Total revenue   $ 350.7     $ 260.6     $ 679.3     $ 449.0                                       Recurring revenue   $ 182.9     $ 137.1     $ 356.2     $ 256.0                                       % of total revenue     52 %      53 %      52 %      57 %    Domestic   $ 287.7     $ 202.8     $ 547.9     $ 344.7     International     63.0       57.8       131.4       104.3                                       Total revenue   $ 350.7     $ 260.6     $ 679.3     $ 449.0                                       % of Revenue - Domestic     82 %      78 %      81 %      77 %    % of Revenue - International     18 %      22 %      19 %      23 %          Domestic Unit Sales     86       56       166       100     International Unit Sales     22       20       46       42                                       Total Unit Sales     108       76       212       142                                       20    Table of Contents Product Revenue  Product revenue was $295.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010 compared with $219.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009. Second quarter 2009 product revenue included recognition of $13.8 million of $20.1 million of revenue deferred in the first quarter of 2009 associated with da Vinci Si launch described above.  Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $127.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010 compared with $95.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009. Instruments and accessories revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2009 included recognition of $1.4 million of $2.1 million of camera accessories revenue associated with the da Vinci Si launch described above. The increase in revenue was driven by an increase in procedures performed and increased stocking orders associated with increased system sales. Procedure growth was primarily driven by hysterectomy adoption.  Systems revenue increased to $167.8 million during the three months ended June 30, 2010 from $123.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2009 primarily due to 32 more systems sold, more second quarter 2010 system upgrade revenue, and higher average selling prices (ASPs) resulting from a higher percentage of the higher-priced single and dual console da Vinci Si Surgical Systems in the systems product mix. Second quarter 2009 systems revenue includes $12.4 million recognition of $18.0 million of system revenue deferred in the first quarter 2009 system revenue associated with da Vinci Si upgrade offers. We sold 108 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the three months ended June 30, 2010, compared with 76 in the same period last year. 89 of the 108 systems sold during the second quarter of 2010 were the da Vinci Si Surgical Systems, of which 15 systems were dual console configurations. We had 19 standard da Vinci Surgical Systems traded in during the three months ended June 30, 2010, compared with 5 standard systems traded in during the same period last year.  Product revenue was $573.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared with $368.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. Product revenue in the first half of 2009 excluded the remaining unrecognized $6.3 million of revenue deferred in connection with the da Vinci Si Surgical launch described above.  Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $250.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared with $175.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. Instruments and accessories revenue for the first half of 2009 excluded the remaining unrecognized $0.7 million of revenue deferrals in connection with the da Vinci Si launch described above. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2010 resulted from the same factors as the three months ended June 30, 2010.  Systems revenue was $323.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared with $193.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2009. The increase was primarily due to 70 more systems sold, more system upgrade revenue during the first half of 2010, and higher average selling prices (ASPs) resulting from a higher percentage of the higher-priced single and dual console da Vinci Si Surgical Systems in the systems product mix. Systems revenue during the first half of 2009 excluded the remaining unrecognized $5.6 million of $18.0 million associated with da Vinci Si upgrade offers. We sold 212 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the first half of 2010, compared with 142 in the same period last year. 169 of the 212 systems sold during the first half of 2010 were the da Vinci Si Surgical Systems, of which 30 systems were dual console configurations. We had 36 standard da Vinci Surgical Systems traded in during the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared with 11 standard systems traded in during the same period last year.  Service Revenue  Service revenue, comprised primarily of system service and customer training, increased 34% to $55.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010 compared with $41.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009. We typically enter into system    21    Table of Contents  service contracts at the time systems are sold. These service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service period. Higher service revenue for second quarter of 2010 was primarily driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue. There were approximately 1,482 and 1,171 systems installed, entering the second quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Service revenue increased 32% to $106.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared with $80.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. Higher service revenue during the first six months of 2010 was primarily driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue.  Gross Profit  Product gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2010 increased 36% to $222.6 million, or 75.4% of product revenue, compared with $163.8 million, or 74.7% of product revenue, for the three months ended June 30, 2009. Product gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2010 increased 62% to $432.6 million, or 75.4% of product revenue, compared with $267.6 million, or 72.6% of product revenue, for the six months ended June 30, 2009. The higher product gross profit was driven by higher 2010 product revenue, as described above. The higher product gross profit percentage for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 was driven by higher first and second quarter 2010 system ASPs, system and instrument material cost reductions, and leveraging manufacturing overhead across higher revenue.  Service gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2010 increased 30% to $34.2 million, or 61.7% of service revenue, compared with $26.4 million, or 63.9% of service revenue, for the three months ended June 30, 2009. Service gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2010 increased 26% to $64.7 million, or 61.0% of service revenue, compared with $51.3 million, or 63.6% of service revenue, for the six months ended June 30, 2009. The higher 2010 service gross profit was driven by higher service revenue as described above. The lower 2010 gross service profit percentage was primarily driven by increased service costs per system.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, proctoring expenses, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2010 increased 32% to $88.6 million compared with $67.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2010 increased 32% to $171.4 million compared with $129.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. The increases were due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, higher commissions related to higher revenue levels, and increased stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses were approximately $20.0 million and $37.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, compared with $15.5 million and $29.9 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively.  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. These enhancements represent significant improvements to our products.  Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2010 increased 21% to $28.5 million compared with $23.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009. Research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2010 increased 26% to $56.5 million compared with $44.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. The increases were due to the growth in our research and development organization and higher prototype costs. Amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property during the quarter ended June 30, 2010 was $3.7 million compared to $3.8 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property during the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $7.3 million compared to $7.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2009. Stock-based compensation expense increased to approximately $5.7 million and $10.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, compared with $5.5 million and $10.5 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2009. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expense, including co-development arrangements with industry partners, will continue to increase in the future.    22    Table of Contents Interest and Other Income, Net  Interest and other income, net for the three months ended June 30, 2010 was $4.5 million compared with $5.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009. Interest and other income, net for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $8.6 million, which was $1.6 million less than the $10.2 million recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2009. The change was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on higher cash and investment balances in 2010, and partially offset by lower foreign exchange losses for 2010.  Income Tax Expense  We record provision for income taxes during interim periods based on our estimate of the effective tax rate for the year. Discrete items and changes in our estimate of the annual effective tax rate are recorded in the period in which they occur. We recognize interest related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2010 was $55.5 million, or 38.5% of pre-tax income, compared with $42.3 million, or 40.4% of pre-tax income for the three months ended June 30, 2009. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $104.0 million, or 37.4% of pre-tax income, compared with $64.2 million, or 41.5% of pre-tax income for the six months ended June 30, 2009. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible stock option expenses, partially offset by the effect of income earned by certain of our overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate. As a result of the macro-economic environment in Europe, we now estimate U.S. pretax income will represent a greater portion of our total pretax income than we estimated at the end of the first quarter. As a result, we are now estimating our annual effective tax rate for 2010 will be approximately 37% versus the 36% estimated at the end of the first quarter. We intend these foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible stock option expenses, partially offset by 2009 research and development (“R&D”) credits and domestic production deductions. The state income taxes for the six month period ended June 30, 2009 included a discrete increase of approximately 1.0% resulting from re-measurement of long term deferred tax assets due to a California law change enacted in February 2009.  As of June 30, 2010, we had total gross unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $75.4 million compared with approximately $70.0 million as of December 31, 2009, representing an increase of approximately $5.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010. Of the total gross unrecognized tax benefits, $71.1 million and $65.7 million as of June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. Gross interest related to unrecognized tax benefit accrued was approximately $4.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009.  We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For U.S. federal and California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations currently remain open for all years since inception due to utilization of net operating losses and R&D credits generated in prior years.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Sources and Uses of Cash  Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents plus short and long-term investments increased from $1,172 million at December 31, 2009 to $1,588 million at June 30, 2010. Cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing and financing needs.    23    Table of Contents Consolidated Cash Flow Data (unaudited)                    Six MonthsEnded June 30,        2010     2009        (in millions)     Net cash provided by (used in)        Operating activities   $ 291.1     $ 173.1     Investing activities     (254.2 )      (57.4 )    Financing activities     162.8       (137.0 )    Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents     (1.1 )      0.1                       Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents   $ 198.6     $ (21.2 )                    Operating Activities  For the six months ended June 30, 2010, cash flow from operating activities of $291.1 million exceeded our net income of $174.0 million for two primary reasons:        1. Our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, and depreciation. These non-cash charges totaled $70.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2010.        2. Cash used in working capital and other assets during the six months ended June 30, 2010 was approximately $46.5 million.  Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other liabilities. Accounts receivable decreased by $10.7 million or 5% during the six months ended June 30, 2010 reflecting timing of system sales. Inventory increased by $16.4 million or 28% during the six months ended June 30, 2010 reflecting below optimal quantities at December 31, 2009. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased by $43.1 million or approximately 25% during the six months ended June 30, 2010 primarily due to taxes payable later this year and timing of vendor payments during the six months ended June 30, 2010.  For the six months ended June 30, 2009, cash flow from operating activities of $173.1 million exceeded our net income of $90.5 million for two primary reasons:        1. Our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, and depreciation. These non-cash charges totaled $55.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2009.        2. Cash provided by working capital and other assets during the six months ended June 30, 2009 was approximately $26.9 million.  Working capital is comprised primarily of deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Deferred revenue increased by $10.3 million or 13% during the six months ended June 30, 2009 related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist and due to the deferral associated with the da Vinci Si upgrade offers. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased by $21.5 million or 17% during the six months ended June 30, 2009 primarily due to timing of vendor payments.    24    Table of Contents Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 consisted primarily of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $217.7 million and $17.1 million respectively, and, capital expenditures and acquisitions of intellectual property of $36.5 million and $40.3 million respectively. We invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2010 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $115.9 million. Net cash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2009 consisted primarily of payment of $150.0 million for the repurchase of 1.4 million shares of our common stock, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $12.0 million.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. With the exception of the updates to the following critical accounting estimates, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.  Revenue recognition. We frequently enter into revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as system and services. Judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement, the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical in respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with U.S. GAAP. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance. If shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner, our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations.  In September 2009, the FASB amended the accounting standards related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements that include software elements (“new accounting principles”). The new accounting principles permit prospective or retrospective adoption, and we elected prospective adoption at the beginning of the first quarter of 2010.  These new accounting principles do not generally change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions and we continue to have system and service as the different elements in our multiple element arrangements. For multiple element arrangements entered into on or after January 1, 2010, we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. Because we have neither VSOE nor TPE for our systems, the allocation of revenue has been based on ESPs. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product was sold on a stand-alone basis. We determine ESP for our systems by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the system, geographies, type of customer and market conditions. We expect to review ESP regularly and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. We do not expect material changes to ESPs established as of January 1, 2010 in future periods. However, since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material changes would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement.    25    Table of Contents   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  There have been no material changes in our market risk during the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.      ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  We are involved in various ordinary and routine legal proceedings and disputes that arise in the normal course of business. These matters include product liability actions, patent infringement actions, contract disputes, and other matters. We do not know whether we will prevail in these matters nor can we assure that any remedy could be reached on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Based on currently available information, we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these actions and that the resolution of these cases is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or future results of operations. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  There have been no changes to the Risk Factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, except for the below.  HEALTHCARE POLICY CHANGES, INCLUDING RECENTLY ENACTED LEGISLATION REFORMING THE U.S. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  In March 2010, the President signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), which makes changes that are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. One of the principal aims of the PPACA as currently enacted is to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million Americans who are currently uninsured. The consequences of these significant coverage expansions on the sales of the Company’s products are unknown and speculative at this point.  The PPACA contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions among other things. This includes new fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. Beginning in 2013, each medical device manufacturer will have to pay an excise tax (or sales tax) in an amount equal to 2.3 percent of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices. Though there are some exceptions to the excise tax, this excise tax does apply to all of the Company’s products and product candidates.    26    Table of Contents Other significant measures contained in the PPACA include, by way of example, coordination and promotion of research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures, initiatives to revise Medicare payment methodologies, such as bundling of payments across the continuum of care by providers and physicians, and initiatives to promote quality indicators in payment methodologies. The PPACA also includes significant new fraud and abuse measures, lowering the government’s thresholds to find violations and increasing potential penalties for such violations.  In addition to PPACA discussed above, the effect of which cannot presently be fully quantified given its recent enactment, various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. We cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. The taxes imposed by the new federal legislation and the expansion in government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursements by payors for our products, reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, possibly materially.      ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
