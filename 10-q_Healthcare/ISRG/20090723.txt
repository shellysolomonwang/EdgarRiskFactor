Item 1A: Risk Factors”. Our actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.  Intuitive®, Intuitive Surgical®, da Vinci®, da Vinci S®, da Vinci® S HD Surgical System™, da Vinci® Si™, EndoWrist®, and InSite® are trademarks of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.  Overview  Products. We design, manufacture and market da Vinci Surgical Systems, which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery. The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeon’s console, a patient-side cart and a high performance vision system. The product line also includes proprietary “wristed” instruments and surgical accessories. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly translates the surgeon’s natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro-movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical System is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and 3-D High Definition (HD) visualization, while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery, or MIS. By placing computer-enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the invasiveness of complex surgical procedures. The da Vinci Surgical System is sold into multiple surgical specialties, principally urology, gynecology, cardiothoracic, and general surgery.  Business Model. In our business model, we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, comprised of instruments, accessories, and service revenue. The da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for $0.7 million to $2.3 million, depending on configuration, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. We then generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da Vinci Surgical System. EndoWrist instruments and accessories will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery and will need to be replaced as they are consumed. We generate additional recurring revenue from ongoing system service. We typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period, typically at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $180,000 per year, depending on the configuration of the underlying system.  Since the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System in 1999, our established base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown and robotic surgery volume has increased. Recurring revenue has grown at an equal or faster rate than system revenue. Revenue generated from the sale of instruments and accessories, and service increased from 45% of total revenue in 2006 to 48% of total revenue in 2008. Recurring revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2009 was $137.1 million or 53% of total revenue and for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $256.0 million, or 57% of total revenue. The increase in recurring revenue relative to system revenue reflects continuing adoption of procedures on a growing base of installed da Vinci Surgical Systems. The installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown from 559 at December 31, 2006 to 1,111 at December 31, 2008 to 1,242 at June 30, 2009.    19    Table of Contents Regulatory Clearances  We believe that we have obtained the necessary clearances to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States. As we make additions to the target procedures, we will continue to obtain the necessary clearances. The following table lists chronologically our FDA clearances to date:        •    July 2000 – General laparoscopic procedures        •    March 2001 – Non-cardiac thoracoscopic procedures        •    May 2001 – Prostatectomy procedures        •    November 2002 – Cardiotomy procedures        •    July 2004 – Cardiac revascularization procedures        •    March 2005 – Urologic surgical procedures        •    April 2005 – Gynecologic surgical procedures        •    June 2005 – Pediatric surgical procedures  During the first quarter of 2009, we received clearance to market our da Vinci Si Surgical System.  2009 Business Events and Trends   Introduction. We have experienced rapid procedure growth since introducing our products in 1999 through the second quarter of 2009. This has been driven by the continued adoption of the da Vinci Surgical System for use in urologic, gynecologic, cardiothoracic, and general surgeries. While procedure growth has continued to be strong, system sales during late 2008 and first half of 2009 have been impacted by reduced hospital demand for capital equipment in connection with the current economic recession.  da Vinci Si Surgical System Product Launch. We recently launched our newest da Vinci model, the da Vinci Si. The da Vinci Si brings to market three significant innovations. First, our InSite™ imaging system has been substantially redesigned for increased visual acuity and improved ease-of-use. The HD imaging system’s increased performance is equivalent to the move from 720p to 1080i in commercial television. We believe that the increased visual performance will continue to increase surgeon precision and confidence and will contribute to improved patient outcomes and shorter procedure times. Secondly, the da Vinci Si surgeon’s user interface has been redesigned to allow simplified and integrated control of da Vinci products and other operating room devices, such as electro-surgical units. The new user interface also includes a set of ergonomic controls for surgeon comfort. We believe the simplified interface will allow for easier surgeon training and decreased surgeon workload during surgery. The third significant improvement is the introduction of a dual surgeon’s console for use during surgery, which will allow new methods of training da Vinci surgeons and enable collaborative da Vinci surgery. With the da Vinci Si, a surgeon sitting at a second console can view the same surgery as the primary surgeon and can be passed control of some or all of the da Vinci arms during a case. We believe this will both shorten the learning curve for new surgeons and will allow collaborative surgery in complex cases.  The da Vinci Si Surgical System is FDA approved and CE marked. It is currently available in the United States and most of Europe. da Vinci Si Systems are available with an option to purchase a second console. Existing da Vinci S instruments and most da Vinci S accessories are compatible with the da Vinci Si system. An upgrade from a da Vinci S System to the da Vinci Si System is available for our current customers. We will continue to sell, service and support the previous da Vinci models - the standard da Vinci and the da Vinci S Surgical Systems.  We offered certain of our customers who purchased da Vinci S Surgical Systems in the first quarter of 2009 the opportunity to upgrade their recently purchased da Vinci S Surgical Systems to da Vinci Si Surgical Systems at a discount to the list price of our upgrade. The upgrade program also provided our customers the opportunity to return their recently purchased da Vinci S camera accessories and receive a credit towards the purchase of da Vinci Si camera or other accessories. These customers were given until June 30, 2009 to accept our offer. Total revenue in an amount equal to the discount, of approximately $20.1 million, was deferred in the first quarter of 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, we recognized $13.8 million of revenue from offers declined, upgrades completed or accessories delivered. We expect to be able to complete all accepted da Vinci Si system upgrade offers and recognize the remaining $6.3 million deferred revenue by the end of 2009.    20    Table of Contents Second Quarter 2009 Financial Highlights        •    Procedures grew approximately 52% during the second quarter of 2009, compared to the second quarter of 2008.        •    Total revenue, including the $13.8 million recognized from the upgrade offer, increased to $260.6 million from $219.2 million during the second quarter of 2008.        •    Recurring revenue increased 33% to $137.1 million from $103.0 million during the second quarter of 2008.        •    Instruments and accessories revenue, including $1.4 million of the $13.8 million recognized from the upgrade offer, increased to $95.8 million from $73.6 million during the second quarter of 2008.        •    System revenue, including $12.4 million of the $13.8 million recognized from the upgrade offer, increased to $123.5 million from $116.2 million during the second quarter of 2008.        •    We sold 76 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the second quarter of 2009 compared with 85 in the second quarter of 2008. 47 of the 76 systems sold were the recently launched da Vinci Si model.        •    As of June 30, 2009, we had a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of 1,242 systems, 916 in the United States, 221 in Europe, and 105 in the rest of the world.        •    Operating income, including the $13.8 million recognized from the upgrade offer, increased to $99.5 million, or 38% of revenue, during the second quarter of 2009 from $78.2 million, or 36% of revenue, during the second quarter of 2008. Operating income included $24.6 million and $19.7 million during the second quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for the estimated fair value of employee stock options and stock purchases.        •    We ended the second quarter of 2009 with $902.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, an increase of $80.4 million from the end of the first quarter of 2009.  Procedure adoption  We believe the adoption of da Vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure, and it is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value. The value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes, less surgical trauma, or both.  The procedures that have driven the most growth in our business recently are the da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) and the da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH). Other urologic procedures such as da Vinci Nephrectomy, da Vinci Cystectomy and da Vinci Pyeloplasty, other gynecologic procedures such as da Vinci Myomectomy and da Vinci Sacral Colpopexy, cardiothoracic procedures such as da Vinci Mitral Valve Repair and da Vinci Revascularization, and various general surgery procedures have also contributed to our growth. We anticipate total 2009 procedures to grow over 45% from approximately 136,000 procedures performed in 2008.  Technology Acquisitions  We continue to make several strategic acquisitions of intellectual property. Total investments in intellectual property during the three months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 were $8.0 million and $20.0 million, and $25.7 million and $30.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Amortization expenses related to purchased intellectual property for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $4.0 million and $2.4 million, and $7.6 million, and $3.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.    21    Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income information (in thousands):                                    Three months Ended June 30,     Six months Ended June 30,        2009   % of totalrevenue     2008   % of totalrevenue     2009   % of totalrevenue     2008   % of totalrevenue     Revenue:                                   Products   $ 219,346   84 %    $ 189,780   87 %    $ 368,396   82 %    $ 350,731   86 %    Services     41,278   16 %      29,409   13 %      80,600   18 %      56,652   14 %                                                      Total revenue     260,624   100 %      219,189   100 %      448,996   100 %      407,383   100 %                                                      Cost of revenue:                                   Products     55,542   21 %      50,036   23 %      100,808   22 %      94,888   23 %    Services     14,897   6 %      13,097   6 %      29,299   7 %      26,632   7 %                                                      Total cost of revenue     70,439   27 %      63,133   29 %      130,107   29 %      121,520   30 %                                                      Products gross profit     163,804   63 %      139,744   64 %      267,588   60 %      255,843   63 %    Services gross profit     26,381   10 %      16,312   7 %      51,301   11 %      30,020   7 %                                                      Gross profit     190,185   73 %      156,056   71 %      318,889   71 %      285,863   70 %                                                      Operating expenses:                                   Selling, general, and administrative     67,276   26 %      57,504   26 %      129,642   29 %      106,138   26 %    Research and development     23,369   9 %      20,357   9 %      44,681   10 %      36,658   9 %                                                      Total operating expenses     90,645   35 %      77,861   35 %      174,323   39 %      142,796   35 %                                                      Income from operations     99,540   38 %      78,195   36 %      144,566   32 %      143,067   35 %    Interest and other income, net     5,171   2 %      5,707   3 %      10,187   2 %      14,248   4 %                                                      Income before taxes     104,711   40 %      83,902   39 %      154,753   34 %      157,315   39 %    Income tax expense     42,323   16 %      32,720   15 %      64,223   14 %      61,352   15 %                                                      Net income   $ 62,388   24 %    $ 51,182   24 %    $ 90,530   20 %    $ 95,963   24 %                                                     Total Revenue  Total revenue increased to $260.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009 from $219.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, revenue increased to $449.0 million from $407.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008. During the second quarter of 2009, as described previously, we recognized $13.8 million of $20.1 million revenue that was originally deferred in the first quarter of 2009 in association with da Vinci Si launch. First half of 2009 revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci surgery. We believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure. Our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in all of our target procedures. dVP has been our highest volume procedure to date, while dVH has been one of our fastest growing procedures since 2006. dVP and dVH have represented more than 75% of our total procedures over the past several years. An increasing body of clinical evidence has indicated that dVP offers superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal, continence, and sexual potency. Favorable clinical results have been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology, which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusions. For most patients, a minimally invasive approach using the da Vinci Surgical System offers reduced pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, reduced post-operation complications and a quicker return to normal daily activities.  Revenue within the United States accounted for 78% and 77% of total revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2009, respectively, and 80% and 78% of total revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2008, respectively. We believe domestic revenue accounts for the large majority of total revenue primarily due to the competitive nature of the domestic healthcare market.    22    Table of Contents The following table summarizes our revenue and da Vinci Surgical System unit sales for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands, except percentages and unit sales):                            Three Months EndedJune 30,     Six Months EndedJune 30,        2009     2008     2009     2008     Revenue                        Instruments and accessories   $ 95,827     $ 73,632     $ 175,355     $ 135,473     Systems     123,519       116,148       193,041       215,258                                       Total product revenue     219,346       189,780       368,396       350,731     Services     41,278       29,409       80,600       56,652                                       Total revenue   $ 260,624     $ 219,189     $ 448,996     $ 407,383                                       Recurring revenue   $ 137,105     $ 103,041     $ 255,955     $ 192,125                                       % of total revenue     53 %      47 %      57 %      47 %    Domestic   $ 202,815     $ 175,051     $ 344,713     $ 319,077     International     57,809       44,138       104,283       88,306                                       Total revenue   $ 260,624     $ 219,189     $ 448,996     $ 407,383                                       % of Revenue - Domestic     78 %      80 %      77 %      78 %    % of Revenue - International     22 %      20 %      23 %      22 %    Domestic Unit Sales     56       66       100       120     International Unit Sales     20       19       42       39                                       Total Unit Sales     76       85       142       159                                      Product Revenue  Product revenue increased to $219.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009 compared with $189.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008. Second quarter 2009 product revenue included recognition of $13.8 million of revenue that was originally deferred in the first quarter of 2009 associated with da Vinci Si launch described above.  Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $95.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009 compared with $73.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by an increase in procedures performed. Procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with hysterectomy and prostatectomy being the largest drivers of growth. Instruments and accessories revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2009 included recognition of $1.4 million of the total $2.1 million of accessories revenue deferred in the first quarter of 2009 associated with da Vinci Si upgrade program described above.  Instruments and accessories revenue per procedure declined approximately 15% during the second quarter of 2009 compared with the second quarter of 2008 due to multiple factors. First, there were fewer initial stocking orders of instruments and accessories as we sold fewer systems during the second quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of 2008, and stocking orders continue to represent a smaller portion of total instruments and accessories revenue as our installed base grows. Second, our average revenue per procedure has gradually declined due to customers becoming more efficient in their use of instruments and accessories and a gradual growth in the mix of procedures that require fewer instruments such as benign dVH procedures. We expect our average revenue per procedure to fluctuate quarter to quarter due to variations in stocking orders and customer buying patterns.  Systems revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2009 was $123.5 million compared with $116.1 million during the three months ended June 30, 2008. The increase was primarily due to recognition of $12.4 million of system revenue deferred from the first quarter of 2009, higher average selling prices (ASP’s) resulting from the impact of the higher-priced single and dual console da Vinci Si Surgical Systems, partially offset by fewer system sales. Excluding the impact of our deferral in the first quarter of 2009 of $18.0 million and revenue recognized in the second quarter of 2009 of $12.4 million, our ASP for three months ended June 30, 2009 was $1.43 million, compared to $1.35 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008. We sold 76 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the second quarter of 2009, compared with 85 in the same period last year. 47 of the 76 systems sold during the second quarter of 2009 were the da Vinci Si Surgical Systems, of which 5 systems were dual console configurations.    23    Table of Contents Product revenue was $368.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared with $350.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008. Product revenue in the first half of 2009 reflects the remaining unrecognized $6.3 million of revenue deferrals in connection with the da Vinci Si Surgical System launch described above.  Instruments and accessories revenue increased $175.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared with $135.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2009 resulted from the same factors as the three months ended June 30, 2009.  Systems revenue was $193.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared with $215.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to $5.6 million remaining unrecognized system revenue deferral as a result of the da Vinci Si upgrade offers and lower system unit sales. We sold 142 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the first half of 2009, compared with 159 in the same period last year.   Service Revenue  Service revenue, comprised primarily of system service, increased 40% to $41.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009 compared with $29.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008. We typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold. These service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service period. Higher service revenue for second quarter of 2009 was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue. There were approximately 1,171 and 867 systems installed, entering the second quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively, generating an average of $35,000 and $34,000 per system for each quarter, respectively.  Service revenue increased 42% to $80.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared with $56.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008. Higher first six months of 2009 service revenue was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue.  Gross Profit  Product gross profit during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2009 was $163.8 million, or 74.7% of product revenue, and $267.6 million, or 72.6% of product revenue, respectively, compared with $139.7 million, or 73.6% of product revenue, and $255.8 million, or 72.9% of product revenue, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively. The higher product gross profit was driven by higher 2009 product revenue, as described above. The higher product gross profit percentage for the three months ended June 30, 2009 was driven by $13.8 million of da Vinci Si deferred revenue recognized and product material costs reductions. The lower product gross profit percentage for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was driven by the remaining $6.3 million of da Vinci Si deferred revenue, partially offset by product material costs reductions.  Service gross profit during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2009 was $26.4 million, or 63.9% of service revenue, and $51.3 million, or 63.6% of service revenue, respectively, compared with $16.3 million, or 55.5% of service revenue, and $30.0 million, or 53.0% of service revenue, during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2008, respectively. The higher 2009 service gross profit was driven by higher revenue generated from a larger installed base. The higher 2009 gross service profit percentage was driven by leveraging service costs across a larger base of installed systems, lower service parts consumption and repair costs per system, and reduced customer training center costs.  Total gross profit during the three months ended June 30, 2009 was $190.2 million, or 73.0% of total revenue, compared to $128.7 million, or 68.3% of total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2009, and $156.1 million, or 71.2% of total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2008. Since there was no cost deferred in association with the deferred revenue related to the da Vinci Si upgrade offer, the $20.1 million of revenue deferred during the first quarter of 2009 and the $13.8 million of revenue recognized during the second quarter of 2009 had equal impacts on gross profit, operating income and pretax income. Excluding the impact of the da Vinci Si deferred revenue during the first quarter of 2009 and subsequent recognition during the second quarter of 2009 , the total gross profit margin percentage was 71.5%, 71.4%, and 71.2% of total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2009, March 31, 2009, and June 30, 2008 respectively.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses.    24    Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2009 increased 17% to $67.3 million compared with $57.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2009 increased 22% to $129.6 million compared with $106.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008. The increases are due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, higher commissions related to higher revenue levels, and increased stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $15.5 million and $29.9 million, and $12.4 million and $21.4 million, respectively.  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. These enhancements represent significant improvements to our products.  Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2009 increased 15% to $23.4 million compared with $20.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008. Research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2009 increased 22% to $44.7 million compared with $36.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008. The increases are due to the growth in our research and development organization, stock-based compensation expense and higher amortization expenses of purchased intellectual property. Amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property during the quarter ended June 30, 2009 was $3.8 million compared to $2.2 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2008. Amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property during the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $7.2 million compared to $3.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2008. Stock-based compensation expense increased to approximately $5.5 million and $10.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, compared with $4.4 million and $7.7 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2008. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expense will continue to increase in the future.  Interest and Other Income, Net  Interest and other income, net for the three months ended June 30, 2009 was $5.2 million compared with $5.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008. The change was primarily due to declining market interest rates associated with our marketable securities.  Interest and other income, net for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $10.2 million, which was $4.0 million less than $14.2 million recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2008. The change was primarily due to declining market interest rates and the impact of funding the $150 million stock repurchase announced during the first quarter of fiscal 2009.  Income Tax Expense  We provide for income taxes during interim periods based on our estimate of the effective tax rate for the year. Discrete items and changes in our estimate of the annual effective tax rate are recorded in the period in which they occur. We recognize interest related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2009 was $42.3 million, or 40.4% of pre-tax income, compared with $32.7 million, or 39.0% of pre-tax income for the three months ended June 30, 2008. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $64.2 million, or 41.5% of pre-tax income, compared with $61.3 million, or 39.0% of pre-tax income for the six months ended June 30, 2008. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible stock option expenses, partially offset by 2009 research and development (“R&D”) credits and domestic production deductions. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible stock option expenses, partially offset by domestic production deductions.  A California tax law change enacted in February 2009 allows an elective single sales factor for state apportionment for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. We expect to benefit from the California single sale factor election for apportioning income for years 2011 and beyond. As a result of its anticipated election of the single sales factor, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” we re-measured our deferred tax assets taking into account the reversal pattern and the expected California tax rate under the elective single sales factor. The impact of this change resulted in a decrease to California beginning deferred tax assets of $1.6 million and this charge was recorded in our income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2009.    25    Table of Contents As of June 30, 2009, we had total gross unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $51.0 million compared with approximately $42.0 million as of December 31, 2008, representing an increase of approximately $9.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. Of the total gross unrecognized tax benefits, $49.9 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition.  We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For U.S. federal and California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations currently remain open for all years since inception due to utilization of net operating losses and R&D credits generated in prior years.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Sources and Uses of Cash  Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents plus short and long-term investments increased from $901.9 million at December 31, 2008 to $902.1 million at June 30, 2009, including the $150.0 million stock repurchase. Cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing and financing needs.  Consolidated Cash Flow Data                    Six MonthsEnded June 30,        2009     2008        (in thousands)     Net cash provided by (used in)        Operating activities   $ 173,113     $ 104,185     Investing activities     (57,434 )      (63,600 )    Financing activities     (136,976 )      58,898     Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents     95       715                       Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents   $ (21,202 )    $ 100,198                      Operating Activities  For the six months ended June 30, 2009, cash flow from operating activities of $173.1 million exceeded our net income of $90.5 million for two primary reasons:        1. Our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, and depreciation. These non-cash charges totaled $55.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2009.        2. Cash provided by working capital and other assets during the six months ended June 30, 2009 was approximately $26.9 million.  Working capital is comprised primarily of deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Deferred revenue increased by $10.3 million or 13% during the six months ended June 30, 2009 related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist and due to the deferral associated with the da Vinci Si upgrade offers. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased by $21.5 million or 17% during the six months ended June 30, 2009 primarily due to timing of vendor payments.  For the six months ended June 30, 2008, cash flow from operating activities of $104.2 million exceeded our net income of $96.0 million due to:        1. Non-cash charges to our net income in the form of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, and depreciation. These non-cash charges totaled $39.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2008.        2. Partially offset by $31.7 million of investments in working capital for the six months ended June 30, 2008.    26    Table of Contents Accounts receivable increased by $31.7 million or 24% during the six months ended June 30, 2008 reflecting increased revenue and the timing of system sales. Inventory increased by $10.2 million or 31% during the six months ended June 30, 2008. The increase in 2008 reflects inventory necessary to support growth in our business and inventory associated with the start up of our Mexican manufacturing operations. Deferred revenue increased by $11.4 million or 21% for the six months ended June 30, 2008 which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities decreased by $5.6 million or 6% during the six months ended June 30, 2008 primarily due to the timing of vendor payments.  Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 consisted primarily of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $17.1 million and $11.6 million respectively, and, capital expenditures and acquisitions of intellectual property of $40.3 million and $52.0 million respectively. We invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds. We are not a capital intensive business.  Financing Activities  Net cash used by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2009 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $12.1 million and payment of $150.0 million for the repurchase of 1.4 million shares of our common stock through the accelerated share repurchase program. As of June 30, 2009, we had $150.0 million remaining under the board authorized amount of stock repurchases. Net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2008 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $23.3 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $35.6 million.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008.      ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  There have been no material changes in our market risk during the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.      ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.    27    Table of Contents As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.    28    Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  We are involved in various ordinary and routine legal proceedings and disputes that arise in the normal course of business. These matters include product liability actions, patent infringement actions, contract disputes, and other matters. We do not know whether we will prevail in these matters nor can we assure that any remedy could be reached on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Based on currently available information, we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these actions and that the resolution of these cases is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or future results of operations. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,” we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  With the exception of the new risk factors below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.  WE MAY INCUR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY HEDGE OUR EXPOSURE.  Our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. We have established a hedging program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily for the Euro. We regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments as necessary based on the judgment factors discussed above. Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  HEALTHCARE REFORMS, CHANGES IN HEALTHCARE POLICIES AND CHANGES TO THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENTS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS   The U. S. government has in the past, is currently considering and may in the future, consider healthcare policies and proposals intended to curb rising healthcare costs, including those that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services. State and local governments, as well as a number of foreign governments, are also considering or have adopted similar types of policies. Future significant changes in the healthcare systems in the United States or elsewhere, and current uncertainty about whether and how changes may be implemented, could have a negative impact on the demand for our products and services and our business. These include changes that may reduce reimbursement rates for procedures using our products and changes that may be proposed or implemented by the current U.S. Presidential administration or Congress. It is unclear which, if any, of the various U.S. healthcare reforms currently being discussed and/or proposed might be enacted by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by the President. We are unable to predict what healthcare reform legislation or regulations, if any, will be enacted in the United States or elsewhere; whether other healthcare legislation or regulations affecting our business may be proposed or enacted in the future; what effect any legislation or regulation would have on our business; or the effect ongoing uncertainty about these matters will have on the purchasing decisions of our customers.    29    Table of Contents     ITEM 2.
