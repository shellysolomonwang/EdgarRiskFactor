Item 1A: Risk Factors”. Our actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.  Intuitive®, Intuitive Surgical®, da Vinci®, da Vinci®S™, da Vinci®Si™, TilePro™, Solo Surgery™, EndoWrist®, InSite®, and Navigator™ are trademarks of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.  Overview  Products. We design, manufacture and market da Vinci Surgical Systems, which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery. The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeon’s console, a patient-side cart and a high performance vision system. The product line also includes proprietary “wristed” instruments and surgical accessories. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly translates the surgeon’s natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro-movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical System is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and 3-D HD visualization, while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery, or MIS. By placing computer-enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the invasiveness of complex surgical procedures. The da Vinci Surgical System is sold into multiple surgical specialties, principally urology, gynecology, cardiothoracic, and general surgery.  Business Model. In our business model, we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, comprised of instrument, accessory, and service revenue. The da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for $0.7 million to $2.3 million, depending on configuration, and includes one year service, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. We then generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da Vinci Surgical System. EndoWrist instruments and accessories will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery and will need to be replaced as they are consumed. We generate additional recurring revenue from ongoing system service. We typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period, at an annual rate of $100,000 to $180,000 per year, depending on configuration of the underlying system.    19    Table of Contents Since the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System in 1999, our established base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown and robotic surgery volume has increased. Recurring revenue has grown at an equal or faster rate than system revenue. Revenue generated from the sale of instruments and accessories, and service increased from 45% of revenue in 2006 to 48% of revenue in 2008. Recurring revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $118.9 million or 63% of total revenue. The increase in recurring revenue relative to system revenue reflects continuing adoption of procedures coupled with the $18.0 million of deferred system revenue outlined below and reduced hospital capital spending.  Regulatory Clearances  We believe that we have obtained all of the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States. As we make additions to the target procedures, we will continue to obtain the necessary clearances. The following table lists chronologically our FDA clearances to date:        •    July 2000 – General laparoscopic procedures        •    March 2001 – Non-cardiac thoracoscopic procedures        •    May 2001 – Prostatectomy procedures        •    November 2002 – Cardiotomy procedures        •    July 2004 – Cardiac revascularization procedures        •    March 2005 – Urologic surgical procedures        •    April 2005 – Gynecologic surgical procedures        •    June 2005 – Pediatric surgical procedures  During the first quarter of 2009, we received clearance to market our da Vinci Si Surgical System.  2009 Business Events and Trends   Introduction. We have experienced rapid procedure growth since introducing our products in 1999 through the first quarter of 2009. This has been driven by the continued adoption of the da Vinci Surgical System for use in urologic, gynecologic, cardiothoracic, and general surgeries. While procedure growth has continued to be strong, system sales have been impacted by reduced hospital demand for capital equipment in connection with the current economic recession.  da Vinci Si Surgical System Product Launch. This quarter, we launched our newest da Vinci model, the da Vinci Si. The da Vinci Si brings to market three significant innovations. First, it introduces a dual surgeons’ console for use during surgery, which will allow new methods of training da Vinci surgeons and enable collaborative da Vinci surgery. With the da Vinci Si, a surgeon sitting at a second console can view the same surgery as the primary surgeon and can be passed control of some or all of the da Vinci arms during a case. We believe this will both shorten the learning curve for new surgeons and will allow collaborative surgery in complex cases. Secondly, our Insight™ imaging system has been substantially redesigned for increased visual acuity and improved ease-of-use. The HD imaging system’s increased performance is equivalent to the move from 720p to 1080i in commercial television. We believe that the increased visual performance will continue to increase surgeon precision and confidence and will contribute to improved patient outcomes and shorter procedure times. The third significant improvement is the da Vinci Si surgeon’s user interface, which has been redesigned to allow simplified and integrated control of da Vinci and other operating room devices, such as electro-surgical units. The new user interface also includes a set of ergonomic controls for surgeon comfort. The simplified interface will allow for easier surgeon training and decreased surgeon workload during surgery.    20    Table of Contents The da Vinci Si system is FDA approved and CE marked. It is currently available in the United States and most of Europe. da Vinci Si systems will be available with an option to purchase a second console. Existing da Vinci S instruments and most da Vinci S accessories are compatible with the da Vinci Si system. An upgrade from da Vinci S systems to the da Vinci Si system is available for our current customers. We will continue to sell, service and support both the da Vinci and the da Vinci S Surgical Systems.  In April 2009, we offered certain of our customers who purchased da Vinci S Surgical Systems in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the opportunity to upgrade their recently purchased da Vinci S Surgical Systems to da Vinci Si Surgical Systems. Under this program, the upgrade is being offered at a discount to its fair value. These customers have been given until June 30, 2009 to accept our offer. In accordance with EITF No. 00-21, “Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” (EITF 00-21), revenue in an amount equal to the discount, totaling approximately $18.0 million, has been deferred from the original sale of the da Vinci S Surgical Systems in the first quarter. The amounts deferred from the first quarter will be recognized as revenue by June 30, 2009 for those customers not accepting our offer and at the date the upgrade is installed for those customers accepting our offer. We anticipate being able to complete all the upgrades offered by December 31, 2009. The upgrade program also provided our customers the opportunity to return their recently purchased da Vinci S camera accessories for a 75% credit towards the purchase of da Vinci Si camera or other accessories. In accordance with SFAS No. 48 “Revenue recognition when return right exists” (SFAS 48), we provided return reserves of approximately $2.1 million, for the entire amount of revenue originally recorded in association with the returnable da Vinci S camera equipment. The deferred accessory revenue will be recognized as revenue by June 30, 2009 for those customers not accepting our offer. In the case customers accept our offer, we will recognize revenue on the replacement camera accessories plus 25% of the revenue value of the returned camera accessories upon shipment of the replacement camera accessories.  First Quarter 2009 Financial Highlights        •    Procedures grew 60% to approximately 45,500 procedures performed during the first quarter of 2009.        •    Total revenue increased to $188.4 million from $188.2 million during the first quarter of 2008.        •    Recurring revenue increased to $118.9 million from $89.1 million during the first quarter of 2008.        •    Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $79.5 million from $61.9 million during the first quarter of 2008.        •    System revenue was $69.5 million compared with $99.1 million during the first quarter of 2008.        •    We sold 66 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the first quarter of 2009 compared with 74 in the first quarter of 2008.        •    As of March 31, 2009, we had a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of 1,171 systems, 863 in North America, 211 in Europe, and 97 in the rest of the world.        •    Operating income was $45.0 million compared to $64.9 million during the first quarter of 2008. Operating income was net of $20.1 million of revenue deferral associated with the da Vinci Si launch. Operating income included $22.7 million and $14.6 million during the first quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for the estimated fair value of employee stock options and stock purchases.        •    During the first quarter of 2009, we entered into a $150 million Accelerated Stock Repurchase program. During March 2009, 1.4 million shares of common stock were received and retired under the program.        •    We ended the first quarter of 2009 with $821.7 million in cash and investments. Cash and investments decreased by $80.1 million from the fourth quarter of 2008, including the $150 million stock repurchase.  Procedure adoption  We believe the adoption of da Vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure, and is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value. The value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes, less surgical trauma, or both.  The procedures that have driven the most growth in our business recently are the da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) and the da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH). Other urologic procedures such as da Vinci Nephrectomy, da Vinci Cystectomy and da Vinci Pyeloplasty, other gynecologic procedures such as da Vinci Myomectomy and da Vinci Sacral Colpopexy, cardiothoracic procedures such as da Vinci Mitral Valve Repair and da Vinci Revascularization, and da Vinci Gastric Bypass have also contributed to our growth. We anticipate total 2009 procedures to grow over 40% from approximately 136,000 procedures performed in 2008.    21    Table of Contents Technology Acquisitions  We continue to make several strategic acquisitions of intellectual property. Total investments in intellectual property during the three months ended March 31, 2009 were $17.7 million, compared to $10.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2008. Amortization expenses related to purchased intellectual property, for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $3.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively.

First quarter 2009 revenue of $188.4 million was net of $20.1 million of revenue which was deferred or reserved in association with an upgrade program. In April 2009, we offered certain of our customers who purchased da Vinci S Surgical Systems in the first quarter, the opportunity to upgrade their recently purchased da Vinci S Surgical Systems to a da Vinci Si Surgical System. The upgrade is being offered at a discount to its fair value. These customers have been given until June 30, 2009 to accept our offer. In accordance with EITF 00-21, revenue in an amount equal to the discount, totaling approximately $18.0 million, has been deferred from the original sale of the da Vinci S Surgical Systems in the first quarter. The amounts deferred from the first quarter will be recognized as revenue by June 30, 2009 for those customers not accepting our offer and at the date the upgrade is installed for those customers accepting our offer. We anticipate being able to complete all the upgrades offered by December 31, 2009. The upgrade program also provided our customers the opportunity to return their recently purchased da Vinci S camera accessories for a 75% credit towards the purchase of da Vinci Si camera or other accessories. In accordance with SFAS 48, we provided return     22    Table of Contents  reserves of approximately $2.1 million, for the entire amount of revenue originally recorded in association with the returnable da Vinci S camera equipment. The deferred accessory revenue will be recognized as revenue by June 30, 2009 for those customers not accepting our offer. In cases where customers accept our offer, we will recognize revenue on the replacement camera accessories plus 25% of the revenue value of the returned camera accessories upon shipment of the replacement camera accessories. We will continue to sell, service and support both the da Vinci and the da Vinci S Surgical Systems and related instruments and accessories.  First quarter of 2009 revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci surgery. We believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure. Our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in all of our target procedures. dVP has been our highest volume procedure to date and has been a significant sales catalyst. An increasing body of clinical evidence has indicated that dVP offers superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal, continence, and sexual potency. From 2006 through the first quarter of 2009, dVH has been one of our fastest growing procedures. Favorable clinical results have been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology, which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusions. For most patients, a minimally invasive approach using the da Vinci Surgical System offers reduced pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, reduced post-operation complications and a quicker return to normal daily activities.  Revenue within the United States accounted for 75% of total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 77% of total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2008. We believe domestic revenue accounts for the large majority of total revenue primarily due to the competitive nature of the domestic healthcare market. The decrease in revenue in the United States relative to the rest of the world reflects decreased hospital capital spending in the United States.    23    Table of Contents The following table summarizes our revenue and da Vinci Surgical System unit sales for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands, except percentages and unit sales):                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2009     2008     Revenue              Instruments and accessories   $ 79,528     $ 61,841     Systems     69,522       99,110                       Total product revenue     149,050       160,951     Services and training     39,322       27,243                       Total revenue   $ 188,372     $ 188,194                       Recurring revenue   $ 118,850     $ 89,084                       % of total revenue     63 %     47 %   Domestic   $ 141,898     $ 144,026     International     46,474       44,168                       Total revenue   $ 188,372     $ 188,194                       % of Domestic Revenue     75 %     77 %   % of International Revenue     25 %     23 %   Domestic Unit Sales     44       54     International Unit Sales     22       20                       Total Unit Sales     66       74                      Product Revenue  Product revenue was $149.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009 compared with $161.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008. First quarter 2009 product revenue reflects the $20.1 million of revenue deferrals associated with da Vinci Si launch described above.  Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $79.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009 compared with $61.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008. Instruments and accessories revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2009 reflects the non-recognition of $2.1 million of camera accessories revenue associated with the da Vinci Si launch described above. The increase in revenue is driven by an increase in procedures performed. Procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with prostatectomy and hysterectomy being the largest drivers of growth.  Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure declined approximately 18% during the first quarter of 2009 compared with the first quarter of 2008 due to multiple factors. First, the revenue deferral for camera accessories mentioned above represented a one-time reduction of $2.1 million to the first quarter 2009 revenues. Secondly, there were fewer stocking orders in the first quarter of 2009 as 66 new systems were placed during the quarter compared with 74 systems placed during the first quarter of 2008. Finally, our average revenue per procedure has gradually declined due to customers becoming more efficient in their use of instruments and accessories and a gradual growth in the mix of procedures that require fewer instruments such as benign dVH procedures. We expect our average revenue per procedure to decline over time, however it may fluctuate quarter to quarter due to timing of customer orders.    24    Table of Contents Systems revenue was $69.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2009 compared with $99.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the $18.0 million system revenue deferral as a result of the upgrade program announced in April 2009 and fewer system unit sales (66 compared with 74). The average selling price (“ASP”) for the three months ended March 31, 2009, excluding the deferral of revenue associated with the da Vinci Si upgrade, was relatively the same as the ASP for the three months ended March 31, 2008.  Service Revenue  Service revenue, comprised primarily of system service, increased 44% to $39.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009 compared with $27.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008. We typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold. These service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service period. Higher service revenue for first quarter of 2009 was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue. There were approximately 1,111 and 795 systems installed, entering the first quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively, generating an average of $35,000 and $34,000 per system for each quarter, respectively.  Gross Profit  Product gross profit during the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $103.8 million, or 69.6% of product revenue, compared with $116.1 million, or 72.1% of product revenue, during the three months March 31, 2008, respectively. The lower product gross profit was impacted by $20.1 million, for the revenue deferral described above. There was no cost of sales impact associated with the deferral. The negative margin impact of the system revenue deferral was partially offset by instrument and system material cost reductions.  Service gross profit during the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $24.9 million, or 63.4% of service revenue, compared with $13.7 million, or 50.3% of service revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2008. The higher 2009 service gross profit was driven by a larger installed base. The higher 2009 gross service profit percentage was driven by leveraging service costs across a larger base of installed systems and lower service parts consumption and repair costs per system.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2009 increased 28% to $62.4 million compared with $48.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008. The increase is due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, higher commissions and other variable compensation related to higher revenue levels and increased stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $14.4 million and $9.0 million, respectively.  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. These enhancements represent significant improvements to our products.  Research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2009 increased 31% to $21.3 million compared with $16.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008. The increase is due to the growth in our research and development organization, stock-based compensation expense, higher amortization expenses of purchased intellectual property, higher costs related to co-development licensing arrangements, and higher prototype expenses. Amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property during the quarter ended March 31, 2009 was $3.6 million, compared to $1.4 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2008. Stock-based compensation expenses charged to research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 were $5.0 million and $3.3 million, respectively. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expense, including the aforementioned co-development arrangements with industry partners, will continue to increase in the future.    25    Table of Contents Interest and Other Income, Net  Interest and other income, net, for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $5.0 million compared with $8.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008. Interest and other income, net for the three months ended March 31, 2009 consisted primarily of $0.8 million net foreign exchange loss and $5.6 million of interest income. Interest and other income, net for the three months ended March 31, 2008 was comprised primarily of $1.4 million in foreign exchange gains and $7.3 million of interest income. The $2.2 million change in foreign exchange losses resulted primarily from the strengthening of the US dollar and the respective loss from re-measuring non-US dollar balance sheet accounts which was partially offset by foreign currency hedging gains. The $1.7 million decrease in interest income resulted from declining market interest rates and the impact of funding the $150 million stock repurchase announced during the first quarter of fiscal 2009. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, we recorded $3.7 million loss on the UBS put option which was offset by a mark to market gain on auction-rate securities (ARS) that have been classified, per SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” as trading securities.  Income Tax Expense  We provide for income taxes during interim periods based on our estimate of the effective tax rate for the year. Discrete items and changes in our estimate of the annual effective tax rate are recorded in the period in which they occur. We recognize interest related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $21.9 million, or 43.8% of pre-tax income, compared with $28.6 million, or 39.0% of pre-tax income for the three months ended March 31, 2008. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2009 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible stock option expenses, partially offset by 2009 research and development (“R&D”) credits and domestic production deductions. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2008 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, partially offset by domestic production deductions.  A California tax law change enacted in February 2009 allows an elective single sales factor for state apportionment for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. We expect to benefit from the California single sale factor election for apportioning income for years 2011 and beyond. As a result of its anticipated election of the single sales factor, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS 109), we re-measured our deferred tax assets taking into account the reversal pattern and the expected California tax rate under the elective single sales factor. The impact of this change resulted in a decrease to California deferred tax assets of $1.8 million and this charge was recorded in our income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2009.  As of March 31, 2009, we had total gross unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $45.0 million compared with approximately $42.0 million as of December 31, 2008, representing an increase of approximately $3.0 million for the first three months of fiscal 2009. Of the total gross unrecognized tax benefits, $44.0 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. Interest included in income tax expense during the three months ended March 31, 2009 was not material. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For U.S. federal and California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations currently remain open for all years since inception due to utilization of net operating losses and R&D credits generated in prior years.    26    Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Sources and Uses of Cash  Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents plus short and long-term investments decreased from $901.9 million at December 31, 2008 to $821.7 million at March 31, 2009, including the $150.0 million stock repurchase. Cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing and financing needs.

Our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, and depreciation. These non-cash charges totaled $28.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2009.        2. Cash provided by working capital and other assets during the three months ended March 31, 2009 was approximately $33.8 million  Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable decreased by $30.8 million or 18% during the three months ended March 31, 2009 reflecting the impact on system sales from reduced hospital demand for capital equipment and the timing of system sales. Deferred revenue increased by $19.1 million or 24% for the three months ended March 31, 2009 which is primarily due to the deferral associated with the upgrade program. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities decreased by $13.7 million or 15.8% during the three months ended March 31, 2009 primarily due to the payment of 2008 incentive compensation and the purchase of stock by employees under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) during the three months ended March 31, 2009.  For the three months ended March 31, 2008, cash flow from operations of $39.4 million was 88% of our net income of $44.8 million for the following reasons:        1. Our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of stock-based compensation, taxes, and depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets. These non-cash charges totaled $17.4 million.        2. We invested $22.8 million in working capital for the three months ended March 31, 2008.  Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $5.3 million or 4% in the first quarter of 2008, reflecting the timing of system sales. Inventory increased $6.4 million or 20% in the first quarter of 2008 reflecting growth in our business. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $5.4 million or 10% in the first quarter of 2008, which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities decreased $15.6 million or 16% in the first quarter of 2008 primarily due to the payment of 2007 incentive compensation and the purchase of stock by employees under the ESPP during the three months ended March 31, 2008.    27    Table of Contents Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2009 consisted primarily of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $15.9 million, capital expenditures and acquisitions of intellectual property of $27.5 million. Net cash provided by investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2008 consisted primarily of sales and maturities of investments (net of proceeds from purchases of investments) of $40.7 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $6.9 million. We invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds. We are not a capital intensive business.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2009 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $5.6 million and payment of $150 million for the repurchase of our common stock through the accelerated share repurchase program. Net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2008 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises of $15.0 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $19.2 million.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008.      ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Interest Rate and Market Risk  The recent financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets has resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in fixed income and credit markets. The credit ratings of the securities we have invested in could further deteriorate and may have an adverse impact on the carrying value of these investments. Credit rating changes are monitored for compliance with our Corporate Cash and Investment Policy and are dealt with on a case by case basis as they occur. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. treasuries and government agencies, corporate debt, money market funds, commercial paper and municipal bonds (which may have an auction reset feature). The securities, other than money market funds, are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The weighted-average maturity of our investments excluding auction rate securities as of March 31, 2009 was approximately 1 year. If interest rates rise, the market value of our investments may decline, which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity. A hypothetical increase in interest rate by 25 basis points would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately $1.6 million as of March 31, 2009. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks.    28    Table of Contents At March 31, 2009, we held approximately $ 82.3 million of municipal bond investments, classified as long-term assets, with an auction reset feature (“auction rate securities”) whose underlying assets are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government. Since February 2008, these auctions have failed and therefore continue to be illiquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process. As a result, our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist. If the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments.  In November 2008, we accepted an offer (the “Right”) from UBS AG (“UBS”), one of our investment providers, entitling us to sell at par value auction-rate securities (ARS) originally purchased from UBS at anytime during a two-year period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. If UBS has insufficient funding to buy back the ARS and the auction process continues to fail, then we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ARS.  However, we believe that, based on total cash and investments position and our expected operating cash flows, we are able to hold these securities until there is a recovery in the auctions market, which may be at final maturity. As a result, we do not anticipate that the current illiquidity of these ARS will have a material effect on our cash requirement or working capital.  Foreign Exchange Risk   The majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, since a portion of our operations consists of sales activities outside of the United States, we have foreign exchange exposures to non-U.S. dollar revenues, operating expenses, accounts receivable, accounts payable and currency bank balances. Our primary exposure is with the Euro.  For the three months ended March 31, 2009, sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 16% of total revenue. In January 2009, we began a hedging program to address the risk associated with non-functional currency financial statement exposures primarily to partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our net cash flow from foreign currency denominated sales. We also hedge the net recognized non-functional currency balance sheet exposures with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. For the three months ended March 31, 2009, our revenue would have decreased by approximately $2.9 million if the US dollar exchange rate would have strengthened by 10%. In addition, we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. A 10% strengthening of the US dollar exchange rate against all currencies with which we have exposure, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions at March 31, 2009 would have resulted in a $0.9 million decrease in the carrying amounts of those net assets. Actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the hypothetical gains and losses discussed above based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements and our actual exposure and hedging transactions.  Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.      ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms     29    Table of Contents  and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.    30    Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  We are involved in various ordinary and routine legal proceedings and disputes that arise in the normal course of business. These matters include product liability actions, patent infringement actions, contract disputes, and other matters. We do not know whether we will prevail in these matters nor can we assure that any remedy could be reached on commercially viable terms, if at all. Based on currently available information, we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these actions and that the resolution of these cases is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or future results of operations. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”, we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Our Risk Factors are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. We have updated our risk factors as stated below to address our ability to effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations.  WE MAY INCUR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY HEDGE OUR EXPOSURE.  Our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. We have established a hedging program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily for the Euro. We regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments as necessary based on the judgment factors discussed above. Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
