We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.  Intuitive®, da Vinci®, da Vinci®S™, TilePro™, Solo Surgery™, EndoWrist®, InSite®, AESOP®, HERMES®, ZEUS®, SOCRATES™ and Navigator™ are trademarks of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.  Overview  Products. We design, manufacture and market da Vinci Surgical Systems, which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery. The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeon’s console, a patient-side cart and a high performance vision system. The product line also includes proprietary “wristed” instruments and surgical accessories. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly translates the surgeon’s natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro-movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical System is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and 3-D HD visualization, while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery, or MIS. By placing computer-enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the invasiveness of complex surgical procedures. The da Vinci Surgical System is sold into multiple surgical specialties, principally urology, gynecology, cardiothoracic, and general surgery.  Business Model. In our business model, we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, comprised of instrument, accessory, service, and training revenue. The da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for approximately $1.0 million to $1.7 million, depending on configuration, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. We then generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da Vinci Surgical System. EndoWrist instruments and accessories will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery and will need to be replaced as they are consumed. We generate additional recurring revenue from ongoing system service and customer training. We typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period, typically at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $150,000 per year, depending on configuration of the underlying system.  Since the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System in 1999, our established base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown and robotic surgery volume has increased. Recurring revenue has grown at an equal or faster rate than system revenue. Over the past five years, revenue generated from the sale of instruments and accessories, service and training increased from 22% of revenue in 2002 to 45% of revenue in 2006. Recurring revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2007 was $71.4 million, or 45% of total revenue, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $195.6 million, or 48% of total revenue. We expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future.    14    Table of Contents Regulatory Activities  We believe that we have obtained clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States. As we make additions to target procedures, we will continue to obtain the necessary clearances. The following table lists chronologically our FDA clearances to date:        •    July 2000 – General laparoscopic procedures        •    March 2001 – Non-cardiac thoracoscopic procedures        •    May 2001 – Prostatectomy procedures        •    November 2002 – Cardiotomy procedures        •    July 2004 – Cardiac revascularization procedures        •    March 2005 – Urologic surgical procedures        •    April 2005 – Gynecologic surgical procedures        •    June 2005 – Pediatric surgical procedures  In an October of 2007 Enforcement report from FDA, the FDA reported on two corrections and removals conducted by Intuitive for our systems. Intuitive has addressed these issues through field inspections and corrections using our field service organization. As part of our quality system, we take a pro-active approach in upgrading software in our field systems routinely and in monitoring system performance. These actions are reviewed by FDA and are periodically reported if they meet certain criteria for public reporting. We believe our quality systems are functioning properly and we continue to work with FDA and agencies worldwide to satisfy their reporting requirements.  2007 Business Events and Trends  Introduction. We experienced rapid growth during 2006 and through the third quarter of 2007, which was driven by the continued adoption of the da Vinci Surgical System for use in urologic, gynecologic, cardiothoracic, and general surgeries.  Third Quarter 2007 Financial Highlights        •    Total revenue grew 64% to $156.9 million from $95.8 million during the third quarter of 2006.        •    Recurring revenue grew 64% to $71.4 million from $43.4 million during the third quarter of 2006.        •    Instruments and accessories revenue grew 70% to $49.5 million from $29.0 million during the third quarter of 2006.        •    We sold 63 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the third quarter of 2007, an increase of 37% compared with 46 in the third quarter of 2006.        •    As of September 30, 2007, we had a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of 719 systems—545 in the United States, 119 in Europe, and 55 in the rest of the world.        •    Operating income increased by 110% to $54.0 million, or 34% of revenue, from $25.7 million, or 27% of revenue, during the third quarter of 2006. Operating income included $8.7 million and $7.0 million during the third quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for the estimated fair value of employee stock options and stock purchases.        •    Our business continues to demonstrate the ability to generate positive cash flow while supporting our business growth. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased by $86.0 million, including $21.4 million of proceeds from employee stock programs, from the second quarter of 2007, as we ended the third quarter of 2007 with $533.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments.    15    Table of Contents Procedure adoption  We believe the adoption of da Vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure, and it is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value. The value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes, less surgical trauma, or both.  The procedures that have driven the most growth in our business recently are the da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) and the da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH). During 2006 and the first nine months of 2007, dVP procedures represented more than half of all the da Vinci surgical procedures. We expect dVP procedures to grow more than 65% from 2006 to 2007. The dVH procedure was our fastest growing procedure from a percentage growth standpoint in 2006 and the first nine months of 2007, and it is expected to grow more than 175% from 2006 to 2007.  New Products  In January 2007, we launched the high definition (HD) vision system in the United States. The HD vision system provides 20% more viewing area and enhances visualization of tissue planes and critical anatomy compared with our standard vision system. The digital zoom feature in the 3-D HD vision system allows surgeons to magnify the surgical field of view without adjusting endoscope position and reduces interference between the endoscope and instruments. We believe the new 3-D HD vision system enables improved surgical outcomes. The 3-D HD vision is available as an option on new da Vinci S Surgical Systems and as an upgrade option to our existing customers who own a da Vinci S Surgical System. During the third quarter of 2007, 35 of the 46 da Vinci S systems sold in the United States were 3-D HD systems. We launched the 3-D HD vision system for our international customers in May 2007 and 8 of the 14 da Vinci S systems sold outside the United States during the third quarter of 2007 were 3-D HD systems. We expect a majority of the systems sold in the future to be da Vinci S Systems with HD vision system, but we do not expect 3-D HD upgrades to comprise a significant portion of revenue in the future.  During the second quarter of 2007, we launched the 3-arm da Vinci S Surgical System. The 3-arm da Vinci S Surgical System shares the same core functionality of the da Vinci S Surgical System including a streamlined interface, a motorized patient cart, quick-click cannula mounts and single-use sterile adapters for rapid instrument exchange. The 3-arm da Vinci S Surgical System includes a standard definition 3D vision system and a patient-side cart with two instrument arms. The 3-arm da Vinci S Surgical System is an addition to the da Vinci S product line and can be upgraded in the future to the full capability of a 4-arm da Vinci S system with HD vision. We sold four 3-arm da Vinci S during the three months ended September 30, 2007.  During the third quarter of 2007, we introduced the EndoWrist Large Hem-o-lok® Clip Applier, a new 8mm EndoWrist Clip Applier, that provides the surgeon direct control in placing large Hem-o-lok® polymer clips. The EndoWrist Large Hem-o-lok® Clip Applier was developed in collaboration with Teleflex Medical, a division of Teleflex Corporation.    16    Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income information (in thousands):                                    Three months Ended     Nine months Ended        September 30,2007   % of totalrevenue     September 30,2006   % of totalrevenue     September 30,2007   % of totalrevenue     September 30,2006   % of totalrevenue     Revenue:                                   Products   $ 135,053   86 %   $ 81,433   85 %   $ 351,387   85 %   $ 221,312   85 %   Services     21,851   14 %     14,399   15 %     59,995   15 %     38,803   15 %                                                     Total revenue     156,904   100 %     95,832   100 %     411,382   100 %     260,115   100 %                                                     Cost of revenue:                                   Products     38,305   24 %     26,663   28 %     103,067   25 %     68,454   27 %   Services     10,129   7 %     6,936   7 %     29,229   7 %     18,770   7 %                                                     Total cost of revenue     48,434   31 %     33,599   35 %     132,296   32 %     87,224   34 %                                                     Products gross profit     96,748   62 %     54,770   57 %     248,320   60 %     152,858   58 %   Services gross profit     11,722   7 %     7,463   8 %     30,766   8 %     20,033   8 %                                                     Gross profit     108,470   69 %     62,233   65 %     279,086   68 %     172,891   66 %                                                     Operating expenses:                                   Selling, general, and administrative     40,163   26 %     28,578   30 %     112,989   27 %     79,652   30 %   Research and development     14,319   9 %     7,979   8 %     32,736   8 %     21,330   8 %                                                     Total operating expenses     54,482   35 %     36,557   38 %     145,725   35 %     100,982   38 %                                                     Income from operations     53,988   34 %     25,676   27 %     133,361   33 %     71,909   28 %   Interest and other income, net     12,220   8 %     3,146   3 %     22,060   5 %     8,602   3 %                                                     Income before taxes     66,208   42 %     28,822   30 %     155,421   38 %     80,511   31 %   Income tax expense     25,289   16 %     11,559   12 %     60,037   15 %     32,108   12 %                                                     Net income   $ 40,919   26 %   $ 17,263   18 %   $ 95,384   23 %   $ 48,403   19 %                                                    Total Revenue  Total revenue increased to $156.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007 from $95.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, revenue increased to $411.4 million from $260.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. First nine months of 2007 revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci surgery. We believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure. Our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in our target procedures. dVP has been our most successful procedure to date and has been a significant sales catalyst. An increasing body of clinical evidence has indicated that dVP offers superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal, continence, and sexual potency. In 2006, dVH emerged as our fastest growing procedure on a percentage of growth basis. Favorable clinical results have been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology, which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion. For most patients, a minimally invasive approach using the da Vinci Surgical System offers reduced pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays and a quicker return to normal daily activities.  Revenue within the United States accounted for 78% and 80% of total revenue for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2007, respectively, and 84% and 83% of total revenue for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2006, respectively. We believe domestic revenue accounts for the large majority of total revenue due primarily to the competitive nature of the domestic healthcare market. We also believe that at this stage, as we penetrate the early adopters of robotic surgery, revenue will continue to be concentrated in the U.S. market, as U.S. hospitals are generally more willing to invest in technology that will drive incremental patients into their healthcare systems. We expect that as adoption progresses and as we reach standard of care for target procedures, international revenue will increase as a percentage of overall revenue.  The following table summarizes our revenue and da Vinci Surgical System unit sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 (in millions, except unit sales):    17    Table of Contents                         Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2007     2006     2007     2006    Revenue                       Instruments and accessories   $ 49.5     $ 29.0     $ 135.6     $ 78.4     Systems     85.5       52.4       215.8       142.9                                       Total product revenue     135.0       81.4       351.4       221.3     Services and training     21.9       14.4       60.0       38.8                                       Total revenue   $ 156.9     $ 95.8     $ 411.4     $ 260.1                                       Recurring revenue   $ 71.4     $ 43.4     $ 195.6     $ 117.2                                       % of total revenue     45 %     45 %     48 %     45 %   Domestic   $ 123.1     $ 80.9     $ 329.7     $ 216.9     International     33.8       14.9       81.7       43.2                                       Total revenue   $ 156.9     $ 95.8     $ 411.4     $ 260.1                                       da Vinci Surgical System unit sales     63       46       163       120    Product Revenue  Product revenue increased to $135.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007 from $81.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006. The $53.6 million (66%) increase was due to higher volume of instruments and accessories, and systems sales.  Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $49.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007, up 70% compared with $29.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006. The increase is driven by a similar increase in procedures. The hysterectomy procedure was the fastest growing procedure on a percentage basis and prostatectomy was the largest volume procedure.  Systems revenue increased to $85.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2007 from $52.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2006, primarily due to the growth in the number of systems reflecting adoption of robotic surgery and increased average selling price (ASPs) resulting from the higher priced da Vinci S and da Vinci S HD Surgical Systems and the favorable foreign exchange impact of Euro-denominated sales. We sold 63 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the three months ended September 30, 2007 compared with 46 systems sold during the three months ended September 30, 2006. Of the 63 systems sold during the three months ended September 30, 2007, 43 were 3-D HD systems. In addition, we recognized revenue from HD and fourth arm upgrades of $1.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2007 compared with $0.5 million of fourth arm upgrades during the three months ended September 30, 2006. The average revenue recognized per da Vinci system was $1.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2007, compared with $1.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2006.  Product revenue increased to $351.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 from $221.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The $130.1 million (59%) increase was due to higher instruments and accessories, and systems revenue.  Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $135.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, up 73% compared with $78.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 is the result of the same factors as the three months ended September 30, 2007.  Systems revenue increased to $215.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2007 from $142.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2006, primarily due to the growth in the number of systems reflecting adoption of robotic surgery and increased ASPs resulting from the higher priced da Vinci S and da Vinci S HD Surgical Systems. We sold 163 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the nine months ended September 30, 2007, compared with 120 systems sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2006. Of the 163 systems sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2007, 102 were 3-D HD systems. In addition, we     18    Table of Contents  recognized revenue from HD and fourth arm upgrades of $3.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared with $1.9 million of fourth arm upgrades during the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The average revenue recognized per da Vinci system was $1.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2007, compared with $1.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2006.  Service and Training Revenue  Service and training revenue increased to $21.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007 from $14.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006. We typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold. These service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service period. Higher service revenue for third quarter of 2007 was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue and higher revenue earned per system under service contract. There were approximately 656 systems under service contract entering the third quarter of 2007 generating approximately $33,000 per system for the quarter, compared to approximately 467 systems entering the third quarter of 2006 generating approximately $31,000 per system for the quarter. The increase in service revenue per system was driven by a higher percentage of four-arm da Vinci Systems and da Vinci S Surgical Systems in the third quarter of 2007 installed base. da Vinci S Surgical Systems carry a higher contractual service rate than four-arm da Vinci Systems which in turn have higher contractual service rates than three-arm systems.  Service and training revenue increased to $60.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 from $38.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. Higher service revenue for the first nine months of 2007 was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue and higher revenue earned per system under service contract. The increase in service revenue per system was driven by a higher percentage of da Vinci S and da Vinci S HD Surgical Systems in the installed base during the nine months ended September 30, 2007.  Gross Profit  Product gross profit during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $96.7 million, or 72% of product revenue, and $248.3 million, or 71% of product revenue, respectively, compared with $54.8 million, or 67% of product revenue, and $152.9 million, or 69% of product revenue, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006, respectively. The higher product gross profit was driven by higher 2007 product revenue, as described above. The higher 2007 product gross profit percentage was driven by the higher 2007 da Vinci Surgical Systems ASPs, instrument material cost reductions and favorable manufacturing absorption. Product gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 included stock-based compensation expense of $0.9 million and $2.5 million, and $0.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively.  Service gross profit during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $11.7 million, or 54% of service revenue, and $30.8 million, or 51% of service revenue, respectively, compared with $7.5 million, or 52% of service revenue, and $20.0 million, or 52% of service revenue, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006, respectively. The higher 2007 service gross profit was driven by higher service revenue, as described above. Service gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 included stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million and $1.6 million, and $0.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2007 were $40.2 million, up 41% from $28.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 were $113.0 million, up 42% from $79.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The increase is due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, higher commissions and other variable compensation related to higher revenue levels, increased stock-based compensation and international reorganization costs. Stock-based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 were $5.2 million and $16.2 million, and $4.4 million and $11.7 million, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the future to support our expanding business.    19    Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products.  Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2007 were $14.3 million, compared with $8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 were $32.7 million, compared with $21.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The increase is due to the growth in our research and development organization, higher prototype expenses, and stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense charged to research and development expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 were $2.1 million and $5.8 million, and $1.5 million and $3.9 million, respectively. During the second quarter of 2007, we entered into several intellectual property co-development arrangements with corporate partners. Costs associated with these co-development arrangements were $1.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses, including the aforementioned intellectual property development arrangements, will continue to increase in the future.  Interest and Other Income, Net  Interest and other income, net, was $12.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007, compared with $3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006. Interest and other income during the three months ended September 30, 2007 comprised of $6.3 million in interest income, $4.1 million of gain on sale of publicly-traded equity securities and $1.8 million of foreign exchange gains. The increase in interest and other income reflects $3.3 million from interest earned on higher cash and investment balances and higher interest rates; $1.7 million of foreign exchange gains and $4.1 million of gain on the sale of investments in publicly-traded equity securities.  Interest and other income, net, comprised mostly of interest income, was $22.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, compared with $8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The increase resulted from $8.1 million of interest income earned on higher cash and investment balances and higher interest rates, $4.1 million gain on the sale of publicly-traded equity securities and $1.3 million of foreign exchange gains.  Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2007 was $25.3 million, or 38.2% of pre-tax income, compared to $11.6 million, or 40.1% of pre-tax income for the three months ended September 30, 2006. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $60.0 million, or 38.6% of pre-tax income, compared to $32.1 million, or 39.9% of pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes, partially offset by research and development credits generated in 2007 and domestic production deductions expected to be generated in 2007. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes. We have net operating loss carryforwards and employee stock tax benefits that will be utilized in fiscal 2007. Approximately $114 million of employee stock tax benefits have been generated in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007. As a result, our cash outlay for taxes will be between 5% and 10% of pretax income.  Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and tax rates, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes under FIN 48, mergers and acquisitions, future levels of R&D spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings, and future federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above-mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Sources and Uses of Cash  Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents plus short and long-term investments increased from $330.3 million at December 31, 2006 to $533.5 million at September 30, 2007. Cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing and financing needs.    20    Table of Contents Consolidated Cash Flow Data                   Nine Months Ended September 30,        2007     2006        (in thousands)    Net cash provided by (used in)         Operating activities   122,675     71,919     Investing activities   (159,609 )   (54,715 )   Financing activities   88,756     30,690     Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents   181     43                   Net increase in cash and cash equivalents   52,003     47,937                  Operating Activities  For the nine months ended September 30, 2007 cash flow from operations of $122.7 million exceeded our net income of $95.4 million for two primary reasons:      1. Our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of stock-based compensation, taxes, and depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets. These non-cash charges totaled $35.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2007. Also included in our net income is approximately $4.1 million of gain on the sale of publicly-traded equity securities which has been classified as an investing activity.      2. We experienced rapid growth in our business with revenues increasing 58% during the nine months ended September 30, 2007. This growth requires investment in working capital, primarily accounts receivable and inventory. Our net investment in working capital and other operating assets totaled $8.4 million.  Working capital is comprised of accounts receivable, inventory, other current assets, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable increased by $25.6 million or 27% during the nine months ended September 30, 2007 reflecting increased revenue and the timing of system sales. Other current assets increased by $7.7 million or 112%, reflecting the timing of payments. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased by $11.2 million or 30% during 2007, which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other current liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased $16.1 million or 36% reflecting changes in the volume of our business and timing of vendor payments.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2006 cash flow from operations of $71.9 million exceeded our net income of $48.4 million for two primary reasons:      1. Our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of stock-based compensation, taxes, and depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets. These non-cash charges totaled $40.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2006.      2. We experienced rapid growth in our business with revenues increasing 68% during the nine months ended September 30, 2006. This growth requires investment in working capital, primarily accounts receivable and inventory. Our net investment in working capital and other operating assets totaled $16.9 million.  Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 consisted primarily of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $147.4 million and $40.5 million, respectively, and purchases of property and equipment and licensing of patents of $12.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively. Our investments are in U.S. government notes and bonds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and auction rate securities, and they generated approximately 5.1% interest in the first nine months of 2007. We are not a capital-intensive business. Our purchases of property and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2007 related mainly to facilities and information technology infrastructure to support capacity expansion in our business.    21    Table of Contents Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2007 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock options and warrants exercises of $41.6 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $47.1 million. Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock options and warrants exercises of $15.8 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $14.8 million.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and there have been no material changes other than to the income taxes policy discussed below.  Our accounting policy for income taxes was recently modified due to the adoption of FIN 48 and is described below.  In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“FAS 109”). This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits, classification on the balance sheet, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. Changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently, affect our operating results. Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, we recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions based upon Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”.       ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Interest Rate Risk  The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including government and corporate securities, commercial paper and auction rate securities. These securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our holdings of the securities of any one issuer, except government agencies, do not exceed 10% of the portfolio. If interest rates rise, the market value of our investments may decline, which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity. A hypothetical increase in interest rate by 25 basis points would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately $0.8 million and $0.6 million as of September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks.  Foreign Exchange Risk  The majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, since a portion of our operations consists of sales activities outside of the United States, we have entered into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Euro, and therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk. Our foreign operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007, sales denominated in foreign currencies were 10% of total revenue. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2007, our revenue would have decreased by approximately $1.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively, if the US dollar exchange rate used would have strengthened by 10%. In addition, we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. A 10% strengthening of the US dollar exchange rate at September 30, 2007, would have resulted in approximately $3.3 million decrease in the carrying amounts of those net assets.  Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. We do not utilize derivate financial instruments to manage our exchange rate risks.    22    Table of Contents    ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.    23    Table of Contents  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION       ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  We are involved in various legal proceedings and disputes that arise in the normal course of business. These matters include product liability actions, patent infringement actions, contract disputes, and other matters. We do not know whether we will prevail in these matters nor can we assure that any remedy could be reached on commercially viable terms, if at all. Based on currently available information, we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these actions and that the resolution of these cases is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or future results of operations. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”, we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.  In January 2007, the California Institute of Technology filed a patent infringement suit against our company in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. We believe the lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend our company in this matter.       ITEM 1A.
