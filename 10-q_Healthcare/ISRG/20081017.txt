We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.  Intuitive®, Intuitive Surgical®, da Vinci®, da Vinci®S™, da Vinci S HD Surgical System™, EndoWrist®, InSite®, 3DHD™, AESOP®, HERMES® and ZEUS™ are trademarks of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.  Overview   Products. We design, manufacture and market da Vinci Surgical Systems, which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery. The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeon’s console, a patient-side cart and a high performance vision system. The product line also includes proprietary “wristed” instruments and surgical accessories. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly translates the surgeon’s natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro-movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical System is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and 3-D HD visualization, while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery, or MIS. By placing computer-enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the invasiveness of complex surgical procedures. The da Vinci Surgical System is sold into multiple surgical specialties, principally urology, gynecology, cardiothoracic, and general surgery.  Business Model. In our business model, we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, comprised of instrument, accessory, service, and training revenue. The da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for approximately $1.0 million to $1.7 million, depending on configuration, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. We then generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da Vinci Surgical System. EndoWrist instruments and accessories will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery and will need to be replaced as they are consumed. We generate additional recurring revenue from ongoing system service. We typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period, typically at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $150,000 per year, depending on configuration of the underlying system.  Since the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System in 1999, our established base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown and robotic surgery volume has increased. Recurring revenue has grown at an equal or faster rate than system revenue. Over the past five years, revenue generated from the sale of instruments and accessories, service and training increased from 33% of revenue in 2003 to 46% of revenue in 2007. Recurring revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2008 was $109.7 million or 46% of total revenue and for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $301.8 million, or 47% of total revenue. We expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future.  Regulatory Clearances  We believe that we have obtained clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States. As we make additions to the target procedures, we will continue to obtain the necessary clearances. The following table lists chronologically our FDA clearances to date:        •    July 2000 – General laparoscopic procedures    15    Table of Contents     •    March 2001 – Non-cardiac thoracoscopic procedures        •    May 2001 – Prostatectomy procedures        •    November 2002 – Cardiotomy procedures        •    July 2004 – Cardiac revascularization procedures        •    March 2005 – Urologic surgical procedures        •    April 2005 – Gynecologic surgical procedures        •    June 2005 – Pediatric surgical procedures  In March 2008 we received clearance to market our system-held cardiac stabilizer and permission to remove the warning in our labeling regarding system use in non-arrested heart procedures.  2008 Business Events and Trends  Introduction. We experienced rapid growth during 2007 and through the third quarter of 2008, which was driven by the continued adoption of the da Vinci Surgical System for use in urologic, gynecologic, cardiothoracic, and general surgeries.  Third Quarter 2008 Financial Highlights        •    Total revenue grew 50% to $236.0 million from $156.9 million during the third quarter of 2007.        •    Recurring revenue grew 54% to $109.7 million from $71.4 million during the third quarter of 2007.        •    Instruments and accessories revenue grew 53% to $75.9 million from $49.5 million during the third quarter of 2007.        •    We sold 91 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the third quarter of 2008, an increase of 44% compared with 63 in the third quarter of 2007.        •    As of September 30, 2008, we had a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of 1,032 systems, 776 in North America, 171 in Europe, and 85 in the rest of the world.        •    Operating income increased by 58% to $85.0 million, or 36% of revenue, during the third quarter of 2008 from $54.0 million, or 34% of revenue, during the third quarter of 2007. Operating income included $21.0 million and $8.7 million during the third quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for the estimated fair value of employee stock options and stock purchases.        •    Our business continues to demonstrate the ability to generate significant positive cash flow while supporting our rapid business growth. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased by $81.6 million, net of $21.0 million of capital expenditure for land, buildings, intellectual property rights and other items, from the second quarter of 2008, as we ended the third quarter of 2008 with $821.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments.  Procedure adoption  We believe the adoption of da Vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure, and it is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value. The value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes, less surgical trauma, or both.  The procedures that have driven the most growth in our business recently are the da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) and the da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH). dVP procedures are expected to grow at least 30% from 2007 to 2008 and dVH procedures are expected to grow at least 150% from 2007 to 2008. Other urologic procedures such as nephrectomies, cystectomies and pyeloplasties, other gynecologic procedures such as myomectomies and sacral colpopexies, cardiothoracic procedures such as mitral valve repair and cardiac revascularization have also contributed to our growth. dVP and dVH represented approximately 79% of the procedures performed during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and no other procedure represents a significant part of our business at this time.    16    Table of Contents New Products  During the third quarter of 2008, we launched the EndoWrist Grasping Retractor. The EndoWrist Grasping Retractor is a multi-functional 8mm instrument to facilitate soft tissue management. The EndoWrist Grasping Retractor is designed with the primary intent of providing an atraumatic, large profile, multi-functional instrument for grasping and retracting abdominal viscera and peritoneal tissue in a totally endoscopic environment, in order to obtain the necessary exposure during pelvic and abdominal procedures. The EndoWrist Grasping Retractor is used in procedures such as hysterectomy for cancer with lymphadenectomy, sacrocolpopexy, and low anterior resection.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, revenue increased to $643.4 million from $411.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. First nine months of 2008 revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci surgery. We believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure. Our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in all of our target procedures. dVP has been our most successful procedure to date and has been a significant sales catalyst. An increasing body of clinical evidence has indicated that dVP offers superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal, continence, and sexual potency. In 2006 and through the first nine months of 2008, dVH has been one of our fastest growing procedures. Favorable clinical results have been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology, which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion. For most patients, a minimally invasive approach using the da Vinci Surgical System offers reduced pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, reduced post-operation complications and a quicker return to normal daily activities.  Revenue within the United States accounted for 81% and 79% of total revenue for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2008, respectively, and 78% and 80% of total revenue for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2007, respectively. We believe domestic revenue accounts for the large majority of total revenue primarily due to the competitive nature of the domestic healthcare market and pronounced seasonal slowdown overseas.    17    Table of Contents The following table summarizes our revenue and da Vinci Surgical System unit sales for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands, except percentages and unit sales):                            Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2008     2007     2008     2007     Revenue                       Instruments and accessories   $ 75,941     $ 49,491     $ 211,414     $ 135,556     Systems     126,326       85,562       341,584       215,831                                       Total product revenue     202,267       135,053       552,998       351,387     Services and training     33,725       21,851       90,376       59,995                                       Total revenue   $ 235,992     $ 156,904     $ 643,374     $ 411,382                                       Recurring revenue   $ 109,666     $ 71,342     $ 301,790     $ 195,551                                       % of total revenue     46 %     45 %     47 %     48 %   Domestic   $ 191,071     $ 123,111     $ 510,145     $ 329,730     International     44,921       33,793       133,229       81,652                                       Total revenue   $ 235,992     $ 156,904     $ 643,374     $ 411,382                                       % of Domestic Revenue     81 %     78 %     79 %     80 %   % of International Revenue     19 %     22 %     21 %     20 %   da Vinci Surgical System Unit Sales                       da Vinci S HD     76       43       206       102     da Vinci S 4-arm     11       13       28       47     da Vinci S 3-arm     2       4       9       4     standard da Vinci 3 arm     0       1       2       4     standard da Vinci 4 arm     2       2       5       6                                           91       63       250       163                                       Domestic Unit Sales     71       46       191       122     International Unit Sales     20       17       59       41    Product Revenue  Product revenue increased 50% to $202.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008 compared with $135.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007.  Instruments and accessories revenue increased 53% to $75.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008 compared with $49.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007. The increase in revenue is driven by an increase in procedures performed. Procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with prostatectomy and hysterectomy being the largest drivers of growth. Utilization per installed system for the three months ended September 30, 2008 also increased as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2007.    18    Table of Contents Systems revenue increased 48% to $126.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2008 compared with $85.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2007. The increase is primarily due to the growth in the number of system unit sales (91 compared with 63), reflecting adoption of robotic surgery; the increase in the average selling price (“ASP”) ($1.37 million compared with $1.33 million) resulting from a higher mix of the higher priced da Vinci S HD Surgical Systems and favorable foreign exchange impact of Euro-denominated sales.  Product revenue increased 57% to $553.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared with $351.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.  Instruments and accessories revenue increased 56% to $211.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared with $135.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 is the result of the same factors as the three months ended September 30, 2008.  Systems revenue increased 58% to $341.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared with $215.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2007. The increase is primarily due to the growth in the number of system unit sales (250 compared with 163), reflecting adoption of robotic surgery; the increase in the ASP ($1.35 million compared with $1.3 million) resulting from a higher mix of the higher priced da Vinci S HD surgical systems and favorable foreign exchange impact of Euro-denominated sales.  Service Revenue  Service revenue, comprised primarily of system service, increased 54% to $33.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008 compared with $21.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007. We typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold. These service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service period. Higher service revenue for third quarter of 2008 was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue and higher revenue for service provided outside of contracts. There were approximately 946 and 656 systems installed, entering the third quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively, generating an average of $36,000 and $33,000 per system for each quarter, respectively.  Service revenue increased 51% to $90.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared with $60.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. Higher first nine months of 2008 service revenue was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue.  Gross Profit  Product gross profit during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2008 was $148.8 million, or 74% of product revenue, and $404.6 million, or 73% of product revenue, respectively, compared with $96.7 million, or 72% of product revenue, and $248.3 million, or 71% of product revenue, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007, respectively. The higher product gross profit was driven by higher 2008 product revenue, as described above. The higher 2008 product gross profit percentage was driven by the higher 2008 da Vinci Surgical Systems ASP and instrument and system material cost reductions.  Service gross profit during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2008 was $20.8 million, or 62% of service revenue, and $50.8 million, or 56% of service revenue, respectively, compared with $11.7 million, or 54% of service revenue, and $30.8 million, or 51% of service revenue, during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2007, respectively. The higher 2008 service gross profit was driven by a larger installed base. The higher 2008 gross service profit percentage was driven by leveraging service costs across a larger base of installed systems and lower service parts consumption and repair costs per system.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2008 increased 56% to $62.7 million compared with $40.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 increased 49% to $168.8 million compared with $113.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. The increases are due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, higher commissions and other variable compensation related to higher revenue levels, and increased stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense increased by approximately $8.0 million and $18.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively.    19    Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. These enhancements represent significant improvements to our products.  Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2008 increased 53% to $21.9 million compared with $14.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 increased 79% to $58.5 million compared with $32.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. The increases are due to the growth in our research and development organization, costs associated with co-development arrangements with industry partners, higher prototype expenses, the amortization of intellectual property rights and stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense increased by approximately $2.6 million and $6.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expense, including the aforementioned co-development arrangements with industry partners, will continue to increase in the future.  Interest and Other Income, Net  Interest and other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2008 was $4.6 million compared with $12.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007. The decline of $7.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2008 was due to foreign exchange loss of $1.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2008, compared with a foreign exchange gain of $1.8 million and a non-recurring gain on sale of equity securities of $4.1 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2007. In addition, we earned lower interest income on our cash and investment balances. Our foreign exchange loss during the three months ended September 30, 2008 was primarily due to the impact of the strengthening US dollar on Euro-based cash and accounts receivable balances, compared to gains resulting from a weakening US dollar in the prior year.  Interest and other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $18.8 million , which was $3.2 million less than $22.0 million recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. The decline was primarily due to the non-recurring gain from sales of equity securities of $4.1 million recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2007. In addition, we recorded a foreign exchange loss of $0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared with a foreign exchange gain of $2.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2007. We also had higher interest earned of $3.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared with the same period in 2007.  In October 2008, we received an offer (the “Offer”) from UBS AG (“UBS”), one of our investment providers, to sell at par value auction-rate securities originally purchased from UBS (approximately $71 million) at anytime during a two-year period beginning June 30, 2010. The Offer is non-transferable and expires on November 14, 2008. The acceptance of the Offer will likely result in a charge to income for the difference between the fair value of the Offer and the unrealized loss on the auction rate securities held ($6.0 million at September 30, 2008 related to the auction-rate securities held by UBS). We are in the process of evaluating the Offer and its potential financial statements impact.  Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2008 was $32.0 million, or 35.7% of pre-tax income, compared with $25.3 million, or 38.2% of pre-tax income for the three months ended September 30, 2007. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $93.4 million, or 37.8% of pre-tax income, compared with $60.0 million, or 38.6% of pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes, partially offset by 2008 California research and development (R&D) credits, domestic production deductions and a $3.1 million increase in 2007 R&D credits recorded after our 2007 tax returns were filed in September 2008. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, partially offset by research and development credits. We have net operating loss carry forwards and employee stock tax benefits that will be utilized in fiscal 2008. Approximately $120.0 million of employee stock option tax deductions have been generated in the nine months ended September 30, 2008. As a result, we estimate that our cash outlay for income taxes in fiscal year 2008 will be approximately 20% of pre-tax income.  On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 and Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 (HR1424) was signed into law, which, as enacted, includes a provision that retroactively extends the research tax credit to January 1, 2008, for two years. We have not yet completed our analysis of the 2008 benefit which will be recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.    20    Table of Contents On September 23, 2008, 2008-2009 budget legislation that contains significant California State tax law changes was signed. Under the new law, for tax years 2008 and 2009, taxpayers may not use certain business tax credits to reduce their tax liability below 50% of their net tax amount, before application of any credits. The carryover period of any credit not allowed as a result of this limitation is increased by the number of taxable years the credit (or any portion thereof) is not allowed. The immediate impact in the current tax year for us is a limitation on the R&D tax credit that we will be able to utilize. We do not expect this change to impact our income tax expense.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Sources and Uses of Cash  Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents plus short and long-term investments increased from $635.4 million at December 31, 2007 to $821.4 million at September 30, 2008. Cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing and financing needs.  Consolidated Cash Flow Data                    Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2008     2007        (in thousands)     Net cash provided by (used in)        Operating activities   $ 175,995     $ 122,675     Investing activities     (166,221 )     (159,609 )   Financing activities     94,784       88,756     Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents     231       181                       Net increase in cash and cash equivalents   $ 104,789     $ 52,003                      Operating Activities  For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, cash flow from operating activities of $176.0 million exceeded our net income of $153.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007 cash flow from operating activities of $122.7 million exceeded our net income of $95.4 million due to:        1. Non-cash charges to our net income in the form of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, and depreciation. These non-cash charges totaled $61.3 million and $35.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 respectively.        2. Partially offset by $38.9 million and $8.4 million of increases in working capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 respectively. Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other current liabilities.  Accounts receivable increased by $43.3 million or 33% during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared with an increase of $25.6 million or 27% for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 reflecting increased revenue and the timing of system sales.  Inventory increased by $20.1 million or 62% during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared with an increase of $2.5 million or 10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. The increase in 2008 reflects inventory necessary to support growth in our business.  Deferred revenue, which represents deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased by $18.1 million or 33% for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared with an increase of $11.2 million or 30% during the nine months ended September 30, 2007 which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist.  Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased by $4.3 million or 4% during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared to an increase of $16.1 million or 36% during the nine months ended September 30, 2007 primarily due to the timing of vendor payments.    21    Table of Contents Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 consisted primarily of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $93.2 million and $147.4 million respectively, and, capital expenditures and acquisitions of intellectual property of $73.0 million and $12.2 million respectively. Our investments are in U.S. treasuries and government agencies, money market funds, corporate debt, commercial paper, and municipal bonds (which may have an auction reset feature). Capital expenditure of $73.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 included $20.0 million of land and land improvements associated with our plans to construct a 154,000 sq ft manufacturing and engineering facility in Sunnyvale, California, $33.5 million of acquired intellectual property rights for use in the development of surgical robotic products, which intellectual property rights are being amortized over their expected useful dates of 5 years; and facilities improvements and information technology infrastructure to support capacity expansion in our business. In October 2008, we purchased an approximately 75,000 sq. ft building near our Corporate Headquarters in Sunnyvale, California for $13.5 million, intended to be used for shipping and logistics.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $42.0 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $52.8 million. Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2007 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option and warrant exercises of $41.6 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $47.1 million.  Auction Rate Securities  At September 30, 2008, we recorded all investments at fair value in accordance with SFAS 157. As defined by SFAS 157, we classified the majority of our investments were classified as either Level 1 or Level 2; however, we classified $86.6 million of municipal bond investments with an auction reset feature (“auction rate securities” or “ARS”) as Level 3. The underlying assets of these auction rate securities are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government.  Auction-rate securities are long-term floating rate bonds tied to short-term interest rates. After the initial issuance of the securities, the interest rate on the securities is reset periodically, at intervals established at the time of issuance (primarily every twenty-eight days), based on market demand for a reset period. Auction-rate securities are bought and sold in the marketplace through a competitive bidding process often referred to as a “Dutch auction.” If there is insufficient interest in the securities at the time of an auction, the auction may not be completed and the rates may be reset to predetermined “penalty” or “maximum” rates based on mathematical formulas in accordance with each security’s prospectus.  In February 2008, auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed. Consequently, the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process. All but one of our ARS are currently rated AAA, the highest rating, by a rating agency. We do not expect to need to access these funds in the short-term; however, in the event we are needed to access these funds, they are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs: a successful auction occurs, the issuer redeems the issue, a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities mature. In October 2008, we received an Offer from UBS, of our investment advisors, to sell at par value auction-rate securities originally purchased from UBS (approximately $71 million) at anytime during a two-year period beginning June 30, 2010. The Offer is non-transferable and expires on November 14, 2008. The acceptance of the Offer will likely result in a charge to income for the difference between the fair value of the Offer and the unrealized loss in the auction rate securities held ($6.0 million at September 30, 2008 related to the auction-rate securities held by UBS). We are in the process of evaluating the Offer and its potential financial statements impact.  Typically, the fair value of ARS investments approximates par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process. While we continue to earn interest on its ARS investments at the contractual rate, these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not have a readily determinable market value. At September 30, 2008, our investment advisors provided a Level 3 valuation for the ARS investments. The investment advisors utilized a discounted cash flow approach to arrive at this valuation, which was corroborated by a separate and comparable discounted cash flow analysis prepared by us. The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates of, based on data available as of September 30, 2008, interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods of the ARS. These assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change.  Based on this Level 3 valuation, we recorded an unrealized loss on these investments of $8.3 million at September 30, 2008, which we believe to be temporary. Although there is uncertainty with regard to the short-term liquidity of these securities, we continue to believe that the carrying value represents the fair value of these marketable securities because of the overall quality of the underlying     22    Table of Contents  investments and the anticipated future market for such investments. In addition, we have the intent and ability to hold these securities until the earlier of: the market for auction rate securities stabilizes, the issuer refinances the underlying security, a buyer is found outside of the auction process at acceptable terms, the underlying securities have matured or we accept the investment manager’s offer to redeem the securities.  Based on the cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance of $408.2 million and expected positive operating cash flows we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity associated with the auction rate securities will adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, and our ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period. We will continue to evaluate any changes in the market value of the failed auction rate securities that have not been liquidated subsequent to quarter-end. Depending upon future market conditions, we may be required to record an other-than-temporary decline in market value at that time. Furthermore, given the volatility of the Level 3 assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis, this potential income statement impact may be greater than the $8.3 million we estimated above.  Liquidity  At September 30, 2008 we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $821.4 million. A portion of these are held as cash in operating accounts that are with third party financial institutions. These balances exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits. While we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts.  The remainder of our cash equivalents and investments are invested in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions. These funds invest in U.S. treasuries and government agencies, money market funds, corporate debt, commercial paper, and municipal bonds (which may have an auction reset feature). Except with respect to the auction rate securities (as further described under “Auction Rate Securities” above), to date we have experienced no material loss or lack of access to our cash and investments; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. We discuss our newly adopted Fair Value policy below.  Fair Value Measurements  Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157). In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”, which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually. Therefore, we have adopted the provisions of FAS 157 with respect to our financial assets and liabilities only. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under SFAS 157 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under SFAS 157 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:        •    Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.    23    Table of Contents     •    Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.        •    Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis. We did not elect to adopt the fair value option for certain financial instruments on the adoption date.      ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Interest Rate and Market Risk  The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. treasuries and government agencies, corporate debt, money market funds, commercial paper and municipal bonds (which may have an auction reset feature). The securities, other than money market funds, are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The weighted-average maturity of our investments excluding auction rate securities as of September 30, 2008 was approximately one year. If interest rates rise, the market value of our investments may decline, which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity. A hypothetical increase in interest rate by 25 basis points would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately $1.5 million as of September 30, 2008. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks.  At September 30, 2008, we held approximately $86.6 million of municipal bond investments, classified as long-term assets, with an auction reset feature (“auction rate securities”) whose underlying assets are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government. In February 2008, auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed. Consequently, the investments are not currently liquid and the Company will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process. As a result, our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist. An auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not. All but one of our auction rate securities are currently rated AAA, the highest rating, by a rating agency. If the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments. In October 2008, we received an Offer from UBS, one of our investment advisors, to sell at par value auction-rate securities originally purchased from UBS (approximately $71 million) at anytime during a two-year period beginning June 30, 2010. The Offer is non-transferable and expires on November 14, 2008. The acceptance of the Offer will likely result in a charge to income for the difference between the fair value of the Offer and the unrealized loss in the auction rate securities held ($6.0 million at September 30, 2008 related to the auction-rate securities held by UBS). We are in the process of evaluating the Offer and its potential financial statements impact. Based on our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan.  Foreign Exchange Risk  The majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, since a portion of our operations consists of sales activities outside of the United States, we have entered into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Euro, and therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk. Our foreign operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency.  For the three months ended September 30, 2008, sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 8% of total revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2008, our revenue would have decreased by approximately $1.9 million if the US dollar exchange rate used would have strengthened by 10%. In addition, we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. A 10% strengthening of the US dollar exchange rate against all currencies with which we have exposure at September 30, 2008 would have resulted in a $0.6 million decrease in the carrying amounts of those net assets.  Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our exchange rate risks.    24    Table of Contents   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.    25    Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  We are involved in various ordinary and routine legal proceedings and disputes that arise in the normal course of business. These matters include product liability actions, patent infringement actions, contract disputes, and other matters. We do not know whether we will prevail in these matters nor can we assure that any remedy could be reached on commercially viable terms, if at all. Based on currently available information, we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these actions and that the resolution of these cases is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or future results of operations. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”, we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Our Risk Factors are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. We have updated our risk factors as stated below to address the effect of the current credit crisis on our business and to address the concerns on our investment portfolio in light of current market conditions.  CURRENT CREDIT AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS COULD DELAY, OR PREVENT OUR CUSTOMERS FROM OBTAINING FINANCING TO PURCHASE THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  Due to the recent tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit, particularly in the United States, our customers may be delayed in obtaining, or may not be able to obtain, necessary financing for their purchases of the da Vinci Surgical System. Delays of this nature would adversely affect our product sales and revenues, and therefore harm our business and results of operations.  THE INVESTMENT OF OUR SUBSTANTIAL CASH BALANCE AND OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS WHICH MAY CAUSE LOSSES AND AFFECT THE LIQUIDITY OF THESE INVESTMENTS.  At September 30, 2008, we had $227.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $593.8 million in investments in marketable debt securities. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. treasuries and government agencies, corporate debt, money market funds, commercial paper and municipal bonds (which may have an auction reset feature) meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. While we do not hold any investments whose value is directly correlated to sub-prime debt, these risks have been and may further be exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults, which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, we determined that any declines in the fair value of our investments were temporary. There may be further declines in the value of these investments, which we may determine to be other-than-temporary. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.  At September 30, 2008, we held approximately $86.6 million of municipal notes investments, classified as long-term assets, with an auction reset feature (“auction rate securities”) whose underlying assets are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government. In February 2008, auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed. Consequently, the investments are not currently liquid and the Company will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process. As a result, our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or may not exist. An auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not. All but one of our auction rate securities, are currently rated AAA, the highest rating, by a rating agency. If the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments. We believe these securities are not significantly impaired, primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities; however, it could take until the final maturity of the underlying bonds (up to 30 years) to realize our investments’ recorded value. In October 2008, the Company received an Offer from UBS, one of its investment providers, to sell at par value auction-rate securities originally purchased from UBS (approximately $71 million) at anytime during a two-year period beginning June 30, 2010. The Offer is non-transferable and expires on November 14, 2008. The acceptance of the Offer will likely result in a charge to income for the difference between the fair value of the Offer and the unrealized loss on the auction rate securities held ($6.0 million at September 30, 2008 related to the auction-rate securities held by UBS). The Company is in the process of evaluating the Offer and its potential financial statements impact. However, there is no assurance that UBS will have enough financial resources necessary to perform its obligations under the Offer. Based on our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan.    26    Table of Contents   ITEM 2.
