Item 1A. Risk Factors  The following risk factors and other information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended September 28, 2007 should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE OR KEEP PACE WITH CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE AND THE DIRECTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND CUSTOMER DEMANDS, OUR PRODUCTS MAY BECOME LESS USEFUL OR OBSOLETE AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS WILL SUFFER  The marketplace for our radiation therapy products, including our Oncology Systems products, is characterized by rapid change and technological innovation. Because our products often have long development and government approval cycles, we must anticipate changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands. For example, most of our recent product introductions in our Oncology Systems business segment have related to IMRT and IGRT, and enhancements of existing products through greater systems integration and simplification.  We believe that IMRT has become a well-accepted standard of treatment in the radiation oncology market. However, if future studies contradict current knowledge about IMRT or call into question the effectiveness of our IMRT products or show negative side effects, or if other more effective technologies are introduced, our revenues could fail to increase or could decrease. Our success will depend upon the continued growth in awareness, acceptance and success of IMRT in general and acceptance of our products utilizing this technology in particular. IMRT drove high order and revenue growth in North America from 1999 to 2003. However, as more institutions purchase IMRT-equipped linear accelerators or upgrade their existing accelerators with IMRT technology, the market for IMRT products may become saturated and we would face competition from newer technologies. We have seen and continue to expect that the rate of growth for IMRT equipment will be lower than what we have experienced previously, particularly in the North American market, as over 50% of our customer sites worldwide have the products and accessories necessary to perform IMRT. Our future success, therefore, will depend on our ability to accurately anticipate and capitalize on new customer demands through technological innovations and changes, including new technologies for treatment such as IGRT and VMAT, as well as new products such as our RapidArc products.  IGRT is an advanced radiation therapy technology that complements IMRT to further enhance radiation therapy treatments, and we continue to invest in product development relating to IGRT treatment capabilities. We are seeing customers accept IGRT as the next significant enhancement in curative radiation therapy, and demand for our products for IGRT has been one of the main contributors to net orders and revenue growth in our Oncology Systems business segment. Our future success will also depend upon the wide-spread awareness, acceptance and adoption by the radiation oncology market of IGRT and our IGRT products as an evolutionary technology and methodology for radiotherapy treatment of cancers. We believe hospitals and clinics are converting to this new clinical process as early IGRT sites demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of IGRT. Our efforts to increase awareness and adoption of our IGRT products may not be successful. If our assumptions regarding the future importance of IGRT are incorrect, if IGRT fails to be effective as a treatment methodology, or if IGRT fails to become widely accepted, our orders and revenues could fail to increase or could decrease.  In January 2007, we completed the acquisition of ACCEL Instruments GmbH, or ACCEL, a privately-held supplier of proton therapy systems for cancer treatment and scientific research instruments. The acquisition will enable us to develop and offer products for delivering image-guided, intensity-modulated proton therapy for certain types of cancers. While we intend to continue to invest in product development relating to proton therapy treatment capabilities, acceptance of this technology may be slower than with our other cancer treatment technologies due to the relatively large scale, higher costs and complex     46    Table of Contents  project financing associated with implementing a proton therapy system. Our future success will depend upon the wide-spread awareness, acceptance and adoption by the oncology market of proton therapy systems for treatment of certain cancers. Our efforts to increase awareness and adoption of our proton therapy systems may not be successful. If proton therapy fails to be effective as a treatment methodology, or if proton therapy fail to become widely accepted, our orders and revenues may not materialize.  As radiation oncology treatment becomes more complex, our customers are increasingly interested in the interconnectivity and simplicity of use of our various products for treating patients. For example, our linear accelerators, treatment simulators, treatment verification products and treatment planning and information management software products are highly sophisticated and require a high level of training and education in order to use them competently and safely. The complexity and training requirements are further increased by the products’ capability of operating together within integrated environments. We have directed substantial product development efforts into (i) tighter interconnectivity of our products for more seamless operation within a system, (ii) simplifying the usability of our software products and (iii) lowering setup and treatment times and increasing patient throughput, while maintaining an “open systems” approach that allows customers the flexibility to “mix and match” individual products, incorporate products from other manufacturers, share information with other systems or products and use the equipment for offering various modalities of radiation therapy treatment methodologies. We anticipate that these efforts will increase the acceptance and adoption of IMRT and IGRT and will foster greater demand for our products from new customers and upgrades from existing customers. However, we face competition from “closed-ended” dedicated-use systems that emphasize simplicity of use while sacrificing the ability for customers to customize the system to their individual needs, incorporate products from other manufacturers, share information with other systems or products, or use the equipment for differing modalities of radiation therapy treatment methodologies. If we have misjudged the importance to our customers of maintaining an “open systems” approach while enabling greater interconnectivity, simplicity-of-use and lowering setup and treatment times, or if we are unsuccessful in these efforts to enable greater interconnectivity, enhance simplicity-of-use efforts and setup and treatment times, our revenues could fail to increase or could decrease.  Our X-ray Products business segment sells products primarily to a limited number of OEM customers who incorporate our products into their diagnostic imaging systems. Some of these companies also manufacture X-ray tubes or flat panel detectors for their own systems. We, therefore, compete with these in-house X-ray tube and flat panel detector manufacturing operations for business from their affiliated systems businesses. To succeed, we must provide X-ray tube and flat panel detector products that meet our customer demands for lower cost, better product quality and/or superior technology and performance. If we are unable to continue to innovate our X-ray Products technology and anticipate our customers’ demands in the areas of cost, quality, technology and performance, then our revenues could fail to increase or could decrease as our customers purchase from their internal manufacturing operations or from other independent X-ray tube or flat panel detector manufacturers.  We may be unable to accurately anticipate changes in our markets and the direction of technological innovation and demands of our customers, our competitors may develop improved products or processes, or the marketplace may conclude that the tasks our products were designed to do is no longer an element of a generally accepted diagnostic or treatment regimen. If this occurs, the market for our products may be adversely affected and they may become less useful or obsolete. Any development adversely affecting the markets for our products would force us to reduce production volumes or to discontinue manufacturing one or more of our products or product lines and would reduce our revenues and earnings.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP NEW GENERATIONS OF PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN CUSTOMERS OR GAIN ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS BY CUSTOMERS  Our success depends upon the successful development, introduction and commercialization of new generations of products, treatment systems and enhancements to and/or simplification of existing products. Our Oncology Systems products are technologically complex and must keep pace with, among other things, new product introductions of our competitors. Our X-ray Products business segment must also continually innovate to develop products with lower cost, better product quality and superior technology and performance. Accordingly, many of our products require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing process levels. In addition, we are making significant investments in long-term growth initiatives, such as development of our SIP business through the acquisition of Bio-Imaging Research, Inc., or BIR, and entry into the proton therapy business through the acquisition of ACCEL, and expect that further efforts will be necessary to develop and commercialize some of the products and technology acquired. These activities require significant capital commitments, involvement of our senior management and other investments on our part, which we may be unable to recover. Our timeline for the development of new products or enhancements may not be     47    Table of Contents  achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. Commercialization of new products may prove challenging, and we may be required to invest more time and money than expected to successfully introduce these products. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of new products or enhancements. In addition, a few of our research and development projects are funded by government contracts. Changes in government priorities and our ability to attract similar funding may affect our overall research effort and ultimately, our ability to develop successful new products and product enhancements.  Our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products, treatment systems and product enhancements and simplifications, and the revenues and costs associated with these efforts, are affected by our ability to:        •    properly identify customer needs;        •    prove feasibility of new products;        •    limit the time required from proof of feasibility to routine production;        •    comply with internal quality assurance systems and processes timely and efficiently;        •    limit the timing and cost of regulatory approvals;        •    accurately predict and control costs associated with inventory overruns caused by phase-in of new products and phase-out of old products;        •    price our products competitively;        •    manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time, and accurately predict and control costs associated with manufacturing, installation, warranty and maintenance of the products;        •    manage customer acceptance and payment for products;        •    manage customer demands for retrofits of both new and old products; and        •    anticipate and compete successfully with competitors’ efforts.  Additionally, our ability to gain healthcare market acceptance and demand for our new radiation therapy products and treatment procedures may be also affected by the budgeting cycles of hospitals and clinics for capital equipment purchases, which are frequently fixed one or more years in advance, and which may lengthen sales and ordering timeframes. In addition, even if customers accept new products or product enhancements, the revenues from these products may not be sufficient to offset the significant costs associated with making them available to customers.  We cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully develop, manufacture or phase in new products, treatment systems or product enhancements. The roll-out of new products, systems and product enhancements involves compliance with complex quality assurance processes, including the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. Failure to complete these processes timely and efficiently could result in delayed introduction of new products, treatment systems and product enhancements. Without the successful introduction of new products, systems and product enhancements, we may be unable to attract and retain customers, causing our revenues and operating results to suffer. Additionally, if we fail to successfully manage the transition from old products to new products, systems and product enhancements, our customers may delay or cancel orders, which would adversely affect our revenues and operating results.  In addition, the installation times associated with new products generally are longer than with well-established products. Because recognition of a portion of the revenue associated with products is generally tied to installation and acceptance of the product, our recognition of revenue associated with new products may be deferred longer than expected. While we are working to decrease the installation times associated with new products, we cannot assure you that these plans will be successful or have a meaningful impact on reducing the associated revenue recognition deferrals. Furthermore, even if our plans to decrease installation times are successful, potential customers may not decide to upgrade their equipment, or customers may delay delivery of some of our more sophisticated products because of the longer preparation and renovation of treatment rooms required. As a result, our revenues may be adversely impacted over a longer period of time, and our financial results could be adversely affected.    48    Table of Contents ROUGHLY HALF OF OUR REVENUES ARE INTERNATIONAL, AND ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES OR MAKE THEM LESS PREDICTABLE  We conduct business globally. Our international revenues accounted for approximately 50% and 51% of revenues during the third quarter of fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. As a result, we must provide significant service and support on a worldwide basis, and we have sales and service offices located in Europe, Asia, South America and Australia. In addition, we have manufacturing and research operations in England, Germany, Switzerland, France, Finland and China. We also invested in the expansion of our China X-ray business through our recent acquisition of Pan-Pacific Enterprises, Inc., or Pan-Pacific. We have invested and will continue to invest substantial financial and management resources to develop an international infrastructure to meet the needs of our customers. We intend to continue to expand our presence in international markets, although we cannot be sure we will be able to compete successfully in the international markets, generate new business, or meet the service and support needs of our customers there. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:        •    the difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through many foreign country’s legal systems;        •    the longer payment cycles associated with many foreign customers;        •    the possibility that foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income, impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade;        •    the fact that international regions typically have a longer period from shipment to revenue recognition resulting in greater revenue recognition deferrals, higher backlog and a lower gross margin on our products;        •    our ability to obtain U.S. export licenses and other required export or import licenses or approvals;        •    failure to comply with U.S. export laws and requirements which may result in civil or criminal penalties and restrictions on our ability to export our products, particularly our industrial linear accelerator products;        •    changes in the political, regulatory, safety or economic conditions in a country or region; and        •    the possibility that it may be more difficult to protect our intellectual property in foreign countries.  Historically, our international sales have had lower average selling prices and gross margins. So, as the geographic distribution of our orders and sales shifts increasingly towards our international regions, our overall rate of orders growth (measured in U.S. dollars) could slow down and overall revenues and gross margins may be negatively affected.  In addition, we generally retain cash received through international operations in our local subsidiaries. As of June 27, 2008, 94% of our cash and cash equivalents were held abroad. If these funds were repatriated to the United States, they could be subject to additional taxation, and we would not receive the full benefit of such repatriation. Additionally, this could cause our overall tax rate to increase. This could cause our business and results of operations to suffer.  OUR RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  Since we sell our products internationally and have international operations, we are also subject to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may affect product demand, our expenses and/or the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in foreign markets where payment for our products and services or of our expenses is made in the local currency. We manage this risk through established policies and procedures that include the use of derivative financial instruments. We have historically entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of operational (sales orders) and balance sheet exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our forward exchange contracts generally range from one to twelve months in maturity.  Although we engage in hedging strategies that may offset the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the protection these strategies provide will be affected by the timing of transactions, and the effectiveness of those strategies, the number of transactions that are hedged, forecast volatility and the extent of movement of foreign currency exchange rates. If our hedging strategies are not effective in offsetting the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, our operating results may be harmed. In addition, because currencies fluctuate and we engage in hedging strategies over time, movement in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial results positively or negatively in one period and not     49    Table of Contents  another, and therefore make comparing our financial results from period to period more difficult. Also because our hedging strategy is to protect the gross margin dollars on our orders, currency exchange rate fluctuations that positively affect our revenues may result in erosion of gross margin.  In addition, long-term movements in foreign currency exchange rates could affect the competitiveness of our products. Even though sales of our products internationally occur predominantly in local currencies, our cost structure is weighted towards the U.S. dollar, and some of our competitors may have cost structures based in other currencies, so our overall margins and pricing competitiveness may be adversely affected. In fact, we have benefited from the relatively weak U.S. dollar that has made our pricing more competitive with our foreign competitors. This has been a contributor to our international order and revenue growth. Any significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other countries’ currencies may result in slower growth in our international orders and revenues, which then could negatively affect our overall financial performance and results. The relative weakness of the U.S. dollar against other currencies has been a subject of policy discussions within the U.S. government and among other countries’ governments. Changes in monetary or other policies will likely affect foreign currency exchange rates.  WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND IF WE FAIL OR ARE DELAYED IN OBTAINING REGULATORY CLEARANCES OR APPROVALS OR FAIL TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS OR MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES  Our products and the products of OEMs that incorporate our products are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation, both in the United States and in foreign countries. Compliance with these laws and regulations is expensive and time-consuming, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.  In the United States, as a manufacturer and seller of medical devices and devices utilizing radioactive by-product material, we and some of our suppliers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and state and local regulatory agencies, such as the State of California, to ensure the devices are safe and effective. These regulations govern, among other things, the design, development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, import/export, sale and marketing and disposal of our products.  Unless an exception applies, the FDA requires that medical devices receive 510(k) pre-market clearance or pre-market approval before we, as a manufacturer of medical devices, can take orders for or sell those products in the United States. In addition, modifications or enhancements to these products that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness, or that constitute a major change in intended use, require further FDA clearance or approval. Obtaining FDA clearances or approvals is time-consuming, expensive and uncertain. We may fail to obtain the necessary clearances or approvals or may be unduly delayed in doing so. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses of the product, which may limit the market for those products. If we were unable to obtain required FDA approval or clearance for a product or unduly delayed in doing so, or the uses of that product were limited, our business would suffer. In the past, our products have either been subject to 510(k) clearance or exempt from 510(k) clearance. The 510(k) clearance process is generally less time-consuming, expensive and uncertain than the pre-market approval, or PMA, process. If we were required to use the PMA approval process for future products or product modifications, it could delay or prevent release of the proposed products or modifications, and could cause our business to suffer.  Our manufacturing operations are required to comply with the FDA’s QSR, which addresses the design, controls, methods, facilities and quality assurance used in manufacturing, assembly, packing, storing and installing medical devices. The FDA makes announced and unannounced inspections to determine compliance with QSR and in connection with these inspections has issued, and in the future may issue, reports or written notices listing instances where we have failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures or may issue Warning Letters citing failure to comply with applicable regulations or procedures. If a Warning Letter were issued, we would be required to take prompt corrective action to come into compliance. Failure to respond timely to a Warning Letter or other notice of noncompliance and to come into compliance could result in the FDA bringing enforcement action against us, which could include the shutdown of our production facilities and criminal and civil fines. Additionally, if a Warning Letter were issued, customers could delay purchasing decisions or cancel orders, and we could face increased pressure from our competitors, who could use the Warning Letter against us in competitive sales situations, either of which could adversely affect our business and stock price.    50    Table of Contents The FDA and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, also regulates advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. If the FDA or FTC determines that any of our advertising or promotional claims are not permissible, we may be subject to enforcement actions and may be required to revise our promotional claims.  In addition, we are required to timely file various reports with the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including (i) reports of Corrections and Removals from the market of our devices, and (ii) reports required by the medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations and similar international regulations, which require that we report to regulatory authorities if our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. If these reports are not filed timely, sales of our products may suffer, and we may be subject to product liability or regulatory enforcement actions, all of which could harm our business.  Our medical devices utilizing radioactive material are subject to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, clearance and approval requirements, and the manufacture and sale of these products are subject to extensive state regulation that varies from state to state. Our manufacture and distribution of medical devices utilizing radioactive material also requires us to obtain a number of licenses and certifications for these devices and materials. Service of these products must also be in accordance with a specific radioactive materials license. In addition, we are subject to a variety of environmental laws regulating our manufacturing operations and the handling, storage, transport and disposal of hazardous materials, and which impose liability for the cleanup of any contamination from these materials.  As a participant in the healthcare industry, we are also subject to extensive laws and regulations protecting the privacy and integrity of patient medical information, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and similar data privacy laws and regulations in foreign countries, “fraud and abuse” laws and regulations such as physician self-referral prohibitions, anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. We also must comply with numerous federal, state and local laws of more general applicability relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices and fire hazard control.  If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face:        •    adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers;        •    increased pressures from our competitors;        •    investigations, notices of non-compliance or Warning Letters;        •    fines, injunctions, and civil penalties;        •    partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities, or the imposition of operating restrictions;        •    increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals;        •    losses of clearances or approvals already granted, or the refusal of future requests for clearance or approval;        •    seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers;        •    delays in purchasing decisions by customers or cancellation of existing orders;        •    the inability to sell our products; and        •    criminal prosecutions.  Government regulation also may cause considerable delay or even prevent the marketing and full commercialization of future products or services that we may develop, and/or may impose costly requirements on our business. Insurance coverage is not commercially available for violations of law, including the fines, penalties or investigatory costs that may flow to VMS as the consequence of regulatory violations; consequently, VMS does not have insurance that would cover this type of liability.    51    Table of Contents WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS.  Our operations and sales of our products outside the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country, and may differ significantly from those in the United States. In general, our products are regulated outside the United States as medical devices by foreign governmental agencies similar to the FDA. We are also subject to laws and regulations outside the United States applicable to manufacturers of radiation-producing devices and products utilizing radioactive materials, and laws and regulations of general applicability relating to matters such as environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices and other matters, in each case that are often comparable, if not more stringent, than regulation in the United States. In addition, our sales of products in foreign countries are subject to regulation of matters such as product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, environmental and product recycling requirements, import and export restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. In some countries, we rely on our foreign distributors to assist us in complying with foreign regulatory requirements. We may be required to incur significant time and expense in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory approvals, the loss of previously obtained approvals or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could restrict or prevent us from doing business in the applicable country or subject us to a variety of enforcement actions, which would adversely affect our business.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN LAWS GOVERNING OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES WHICH, IF VIOLATED, COULD SUBJECT US TO SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES. ADDITIONALLY, ANY CHALLENGES TO OR INVESTIGATION INTO OUR PRACTICES UNDER THESE LAWS COULD CAUSE ADVERSE PUBLICITY AND BE COSTLY TO RESPOND TO, AND THUS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS   The Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback laws, and several similar state laws, prohibit payments or other remuneration that is intended to induce hospitals, physicians or others either to refer patients or to purchase, lease or order, or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of healthcare products or services for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products. In particular, these laws influence, among other things, how we structure our sales offerings, including discounts and rebate practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting, research grants and other service arrangements. These laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how these laws will be applied to specific circumstances.  Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Although we do not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, or through certain other activities, including promoting products for uses not approved by the FDA, which is called off-label promotion. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties, which can be substantial, and potential exclusion from healthcare programs for noncompliance. Moreover, even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and results of operations.  In addition, we are subject to similar laws in foreign countries where we conduct business. As an example, within the EU, the control of unlawful marketing activities is a matter of national law in each of the member states of EU. The member states of the EU closely monitor perceived unlawful marketing activity by companies. We could face civil, criminal and administrative sanctions if any member state determines that we have breached our obligations under its national laws. Moreover, industry associations closely monitor the activities of member companies. If these organizations or national authorities were to name us as having breached our obligations under their laws, regulations, rules or standards, our reputation would suffer and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.  In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, antitrust and anti-competition laws, and similar laws in foreign countries, any violation of which could create a substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market. From time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.    52    Table of Contents PRODUCT DEFECTS OR MISUSE MAY RESULT IN MATERIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY OR PROFESSIONAL ERRORS AND OMISSIONS CLAIMS, INVESTIGATION BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR PRODUCT RECALLS THAT COULD HARM FUTURE REVENUES AND REQUIRE US TO PAY MATERIAL UNINSURED CLAIMS  Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacture, sale, installation, servicing and support of medical devices and other devices that deliver radiation. Because our products are involved in the intentional delivery of radiation to the human body, other situations where people may come in contact with radiation (for example, when our SIP products are being used to scan cargo), the collection and storage of patient treatment data for medical analysis and treatment delivery, the planning of radiation treatment and diagnostic imaging of the human body, and the diagnosing of medical problems, the possibility for significant injury and/or death exists. Our medical products are used as part of an overall process that takes place within our customers’ facilities and network systems, and under quality assurance, or QA, procedures established by the facility that ultimately result in the delivery of radiation to patients. Additionally, human and other errors or accidents may arise from the fact that our products operate in complex environments with products from other vendors, where interoperability or data sharing protocol may not be optimized even though the equipment or system operate according to specifications. As a result, we may face substantial liability to patients, our customers or others for damages resulting from the faulty or allegedly faulty design, manufacture, installation, servicing, support, testing, interoperability or the misuse of our products. We may also be subject to claims for property damages or economic loss related to or resulting from any errors or defects in our products, or the installation, servicing and support of our products. With any accident, we could be subject to legal costs, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, whether or not our products or services were a factor. Furthermore, adverse publicity regarding accidents or mistreatments involving radiation therapy could adversely impact our business by negatively affecting the reputation of radiation therapy in general, causing patients to question the efficacy of radiation therapy as a viable treatment for cancer and seek other modalities of treatment.  In addition, if a product we designed or manufactured were defective (whether due to design, labeling or manufacturing defects, improper use of the product or other reasons), we may be required to recall the product and notify regulatory authorities. Product recalls may also result in unexpected loss accruals under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, that may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. The adverse publicity resulting from a recall could cause customers to review and potentially terminate their relationships with us. These recalls, especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity or cancellation of customer orders and service contracts, could result in our incurring substantial costs and management time, losing revenues and damaging our reputation, each of which would harm our business.  We maintain limited product liability insurance coverage for our business and currently self-insure professional liability/errors and omission liability. The product liability insurance policies that we maintain are expensive and have high deductible amounts and self-insured retentions. In the future, these policies may not be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts, if at all. In addition, the insurance coverage we have obtained may not be adequate. A successful material claim brought against us relating to a self-insured liability or a liability that is in excess of our insurance coverage, or for which insurance coverage is denied or limited would require us to pay damage amounts that could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operation.  THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY LOSE MARKET SHARE TO COMPANIES WITH GREATER RESOURCES OR THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP MORE EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, OR WE COULD BE FORCED TO REDUCE OUR PRICES  The markets for radiation therapy equipment and software are characterized by rapidly evolving technology, intense competition and pricing pressure. Many of the companies with which our Oncology Systems business competes have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Also, we expect that the rapid technological changes occurring in our markets will lead to the entry of new competitors into our markets, as well as our encountering new competitors as we apply our technologies in new market segments such as stereotactic radiosurgery. Our ability to compete successfully depends, in part, on our ability to provide technologically superior, clinically proven products that deliver more precise, cost-effective, high quality clinical outcomes, together in a complete package of products and services, and to do so ahead of our competitors. Our ability to compete in the radiation therapy market may be adversely affected when purchase decisions are based solely upon price, because our products are generally sold on a total value to the customer basis. This may occur if hospitals and clinics give purchasing decision authority to group purchasing organizations that focus solely on pricing as the primary determinant in making purchase decisions. In addition, the presence of additional competitors may delay customer purchasing decisions as customers evaluate the products of these competitors along with ours. These delays can extend our sales cycle and therefore adversely affect our net orders and operating results. In our sales of linear accelerator products     53    Table of Contents  for radiotherapy and radiosurgery, we compete primarily with Siemens Medical Solutions, Elekta AB (which recently acquired Computerized Medical Systems, Inc.), Tomotherapy Incorporated and Accuray Incorporated. With our information and image management, simulation, treatment planning and radiosurgery products, we also compete with a variety of companies, such as Elekta AB, Philips Medical Systems, North American Scientific, Inc., Nucletron B.V. and Siemens Medical Solutions. We also have begun to encounter some competition from providers of hospital information systems. With respect to our BrachyTherapy business, our primary competitor is Nucletron B.V. For the service and maintenance business for our products, we compete with independent service organizations and our customers’ internal service organizations.  The market for X-ray imaging components and subsystems is extremely competitive, with our competitors frequently having greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Some of the major diagnostic imaging systems companies, which are the primary OEMs for our X-ray tubes, also manufacture X-ray tubes for use in their own imaging systems products. We must compete with these in-house manufacturing operations that are naturally favored by their affiliated companies. As a result, we must have a competitive advantage in one or more significant areas, which may include lower product cost, better product quality or superior technology and performance. We sell a significant volume of our X-ray tubes to OEMs such as Toshiba Corporation, Hitachi Medical Corporation, Philips Medical Systems and GE Healthcare, all of which have in-house X-ray tube production capability. In addition, we compete against other stand-alone X-ray tube manufacturers such as Comet AG and IAE Industria Applicazioni Elettroniche Spa. These companies compete with us for both the OEM business and the independent servicing business for X-ray tubes. The market for flat panel detectors is also very competitive, and we primarily compete against Perkin-Elmer, Inc., Trixell S.A.S. and Canon, Inc. in our flat panel detector product line.  In our SIP business, including BIR, we compete with other OEM suppliers, primarily outside of the United States, and our major competitor in this market is Nuctech Company Limited. The market for our SIP products used for nondestructive testing in industrial application is very small and highly fractured. There is no single major competitor in this nondestructive testing market.  The market for proton therapy products is still developing and is characterized by rapidly evolving technology, high competition and pricing pressure. Our ability to compete successfully depends, in part, on our ability to complete the development of our commercial proton therapy system, lower our product costs, develop and provide technologically superior, clinically proven products that deliver more precise, cost-effective, high quality clinical outcomes, including integration of IGRT technologies such as OBI. In the proton therapy market, we compete principally with Ion Beam Applications S.A., Hitachi Medical Corporation, Siemens Medical Solutions and Still River Systems, Inc. The presence of competitors may delay customer purchasing decisions as customers evaluate the products of these competitors along with ours. In the scientific research instruments market, we compete with other companies as well as the internal engineering and fabrication capabilities in national and international research laboratories. Our competitors in this market include Thales Group, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Advanced Energy Systems, Inc. and Ettore Zanon SpA for our radio frequency cavities and linear accelerators; ASG Superconductors SpA, Babcock Noell GmbH, Danfysik AS and Cryogenics Ltd. for our magnet systems, and Oxford Danfysik Beamlines Limited, Kohzu Precision Co., Ltd. and Instrument Design Technology Ltd. for our X-ray beamlines.  In each of our business segments, existing competitors’ actions and new entrants may adversely affect our ability to compete. These competitors could develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we currently use or produce or that could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, the timing of our competitors’ introduction of products into the market could affect the market acceptance and market share of our products. Some competitors offer specialized products that are or may be perceived by customers to provide a marketing advantage over our mainstream cancer treatment products. Also, some of our competitors may not be subject to or operate under the same standards, regulatory and/or other legal requirements that we do, and therefore, they could have a competitive advantage in developing, manufacturing and marketing products and services. Any inability to develop, gain regulatory approval for and supply commercial quantities of competitive products to the market as quickly and effectively as our competitors could limit market acceptance of our products and reduce our sales. In addition, some of our smaller competitors could be acquired by larger companies that have greater financial strength, which could enable them to compete more aggressively. Our competitors could also acquire some of our suppliers or distributors, which could disrupt these supply or distribution arrangements and result in less predictable and reduced revenues in our businesses. Any of these competitive factors could negatively affect our pricing, sales, revenues, market share and gross margins and our ability to maintain or increase our operating margins.    54    Table of Contents INTEROPERABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THEIR COMPATIBILITY WITH THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE OUR PRODUCTS INTEROPERATE WITH ONE ANOTHER OR COMPATIBLE WITH WIDELY USED THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD DECREASE  As radiation therapy becomes more and more complex, our customers are increasingly concerned about the interoperability and compatibility of the various products they use in providing treatment to patients. For example, our linear accelerators, treatment simulators, treatment verification products, treatment planning and information management software products are designed to interoperate with one another, and to be compatible with other widely used third-party radiation oncology products. Obtaining and maintaining this interoperability and compatibility is costly and time-consuming. When third parties modify the design or functionality of their products, it can require us to modify our products to ensure compatibility. Conversely, when we implement design improvements to our products, customers may be reluctant to adopt our new technology due to interoperability issues; for example, a clinic may be unwilling to implement one of our new technologies because its third-party software network provider does not yet have a proper software interface available. In addition, our ability to obtain compatibility with third-party products can depend on the third parties’ providing us with adequate information regarding their products. In many cases, these third parties are our competitors and may time their product changes, and their sharing of relevant information with us, to place us at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we could be required to obtain additional regulatory clearances for any modification of our products due to interoperability issues with the products of third parties. It is also possible that, despite our best efforts, we may be unable to make our products interoperable or compatible with widely used third-party products or may only be able to do so at a prohibitive expense, making our products less attractive or more costly to our customers.  WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DO SO, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION WOULD BE HARMED  We file applications as appropriate for patents covering new products and manufacturing processes. We cannot be sure, however, that our current patents, the claims allowed under our current patents, or patents for technologies licensed to us will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology position against competitors. Issued patents owned by, or licensed to, us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or the rights granted under the patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. We also cannot be sure that patents will be issued from any of our pending or future patent applications. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources if we have to assert our patent rights against others in litigation or other legal proceedings. An unfavorable outcome in any such litigation or proceeding could harm us. In addition, we may not be able to detect patent infringement by others or may lose our competitive position in the market before we are able to do so.  We also rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret and other laws, and contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying and transferring title (including confidentiality agreements with vendors, strategic partners, co-developers, employees, consultants and other third parties), to protect our proprietary rights. We cannot assure you that these protections will prove adequate, that agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or be independently developed by others. We have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that are maintained and enforced to provide customer recognition for our products in the marketplace. We cannot assure you that unauthorized third parties will not use our trademarks. We also have agreements with third parties that license to us certain patented or proprietary technologies. If we were to lose the rights to license these technologies, or our costs to license these technologies were to materially increase, our business would suffer.  THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM WE ARE INFRINGING THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND WE COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION OR LICENSING EXPENSES OR BE PREVENTED FROM SELLING OUR PRODUCTS  The industries in which we compete are characterized by a substantial amount of litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights. Our competitors, like companies in many high technology businesses, continually review other companies’ products for possible conflicts with their own intellectual property rights. Determining whether a product infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights involves complex legal and factual issues, and the outcome of this type of litigation is often uncertain. Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to infringe those intellectual property rights. We may not be aware of intellectual property rights of others that relate to our products, services or technologies. From time to time, we have received notices from third parties asserting infringement and we have been subject to lawsuits alleging infringement of third-party patent or other intellectual property rights. Any dispute regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and     55    Table of Contents  key personnel from our business operations. We cannot assure you that we would prevail in any such dispute. We also do not maintain insurance for such intellectual property infringement. Therefore, if we are unsuccessful in defending any such infringement claim, we may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of our products, or may be required to enter into costly royalty or license agreements. We cannot assure you that any licenses required would be made available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  SINCE WE DEPEND UPON A LIMITED GROUP OF SUPPLIERS, AND IN SOME CASES SOLE SOURCE SUPPLIERS, FOR SOME PRODUCT COMPONENTS, THE LOSS OF A SUPPLIER OR ANY INABILITY TO OBTAIN SUPPLIES OF THESE COMPONENTS COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS, CAUSE MATERIAL DELAYS IN OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS, OR SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COSTS; SHORTAGES OF KEY RAW MATERIALS COULD HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT  We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our products from a limited group of suppliers, or in some cases a single-source supplier. Examples include the source wires for high-dose afterloaders; klystrons for linear accelerators; array sensors for use in our imaging panels; sesium iodide coatings for the arrays; and specialized integrated circuits; x-ray tube targets, housings, glass frames and various other x-ray tube components. If we lose any of these suppliers or if their operations were substantially interrupted, we would be required to obtain and qualify one or more replacement suppliers, which may then also require us to redesign or modify our products to incorporate new parts and/or further require us to obtain clearance, qualification or certification of such product by the FDA or other applicable regulatory approvals in other countries. Events like these could significantly increase costs for the affected product and likely cause material delays in delivery of that and other related products. Although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against business interruption loss, we cannot assure you that this insurance coverage will be adequate or that it will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. Additionally, some of these suppliers, including our single-source suppliers, supply components for certain of our growing product lines that are growing rapidly. Manufacturing capacity limitations of any of these suppliers or other inability of these suppliers to meet increasing demand could adversely affect us, resulting in curtailed growth opportunities for any of our product lines. Shortage of and greater demand for components and subassemblies could also increase manufacturing costs by increasing prices. Disruptions or loss of any of our limited- or sole-source components or subassemblies or the capacity limitations of the suppliers for these components or subassemblies, including the ones referenced above, could adversely affect our business and financial results and could damage our customer relationships. In addition, we rely upon the supplies of certain raw materials such as tungsten, lead and copper for Oncology Systems and SIP, copper, lead, tungsten, rhenium, molybdenum zirconium, and various high grades of steel alloy for X-ray Products, and high-grade steel and high-grade copper for ACCEL. Demand for these raw materials from foreign countries, such as China, has increased dramatically. As a result, the availability of these raw materials has been and may continue to be limited and their prices have increased and may continue to increase significantly. This could constrain our manufacturing of affected products, reduce our profit margins or otherwise adversely affect our business.  CONSOLIDATION AMONG OUR ONCOLOGY SYSTEMS CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES OF ONCOLOGY PRODUCTS AND THEREFORE OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS  We have begun to see some consolidation among our customers in our Oncology Systems business, as hospitals and clinics are combined through mergers and acquisitions, and as they join group purchasing organizations or affiliated enterprises. As customers consolidate, the volume of product sales to these customers might decrease. Alternatively, order size may increase as what were previously more than one customer combine orders as one entity. As a result, the purchasing cycle for our Oncology Systems products could lengthen, as orders increase in size and require more approvals. Both increased order size and extended purchasing cycles could cause our net orders for these products to be more volatile and less predictable. In addition, group purchasing organizations often focus on pricing as the determinant in making purchase decisions. A reduction in net orders could affect the level of future revenues, which would adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and price of VMS common stock.  WE SELL OUR X-RAY TUBES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF OEM CUSTOMERS, MANY OF WHOM ARE ALSO OUR COMPETITORS, AND THE LOSS OR REDUCTION IN PURCHASING VOLUME BY ONE OR MORE OF THESE CUSTOMERS OR CONSOLIDATION AMONG OEMs IN THE X-RAY TUBE PRODUCTS MARKET COULD REDUCE OUR SALES OF X-RAY TUBE PRODUCTS  We sell our X-ray tube products to a limited number of OEM customers, many of whom are also our competitors, for incorporation into diagnostic imaging systems. The loss of, or reduction in purchasing volume by, one or more of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our X-ray Products business. There has been a consolidation of diagnostic     56    Table of Contents  imaging systems manufacturers over the past few years. The ongoing consolidation of customers who purchase our X-ray tube products, including the consolidation of these customers into companies that already manufacture X-ray tubes, could result in less predictable and reduced sales of our X-ray tube products. In addition, our OEM customers’ products, which also use our tubes, could lose market share to competitive products or technologies and, thereby, result in a reduction in our orders and revenues.  WE SELL OUR LINATRON® X-RAY ACCELERATORS TO OEM CUSTOMERS WHO DEPEND ON CUSTOMER DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE SCHEDULES, WHICH MAY CAUSE ORDERS FOR OUR SECURITY AND INSPECTION PRODUCTS TO BE UNPREDICTABLE  Our SIP business, including BIR, designs, manufactures, sells and services Linatron X-ray accelerators and imaging hardware and software products for security and inspection, as well as non-destructive testing and research purposes. We generally sell our accelerators and imaging products to OEMs who incorporate them into their inspection products, which are then sold to customs agencies and other government agencies, as well as to commercial private parties. We believe growth in this business will be driven by security cargo screening and border protection needs, as well as by the needs of customs agencies to verify shipments for assessing duties and taxes. However, use of linear accelerator and imaging technology in security cargo screening and border protection is in its early stages. Orders for our SIP products have been and may continue to be unpredictable and the actual timing of sales and revenue recognition will vary significantly, as it is difficult to predict our OEM customer delivery and acceptance schedules.  In addition, our SIP business is heavily influenced by U.S. and foreign governmental policies on national and homeland security, border protection and customs revenue activities, all of which depend upon government budgets and appropriations that are subject to political changes, which may cause uncertainty and variability in the timing of orders. Thus, orders in any quarter or period are not necessarily directly correlated to the level of sales or revenues in any particular future quarter or period. This unpredictability in orders, sales and revenue timing could cause volatility in our revenues and earnings, and therefore our stock price.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE SIGNIFICANT EDUCATION AND TRAINING REQUIRED FOR THE HEALTHCARE MARKET TO ACCEPT OUR PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS WILL SUFFER   In order to achieve market acceptance for our radiation therapy products, we are often required to educate physicians about the use of a new treatment procedure such as IMRT, IGRT, stereotactic radiosurgery or proton therapy, overcome physician objections to some of the effects of the product or its related treatment regimen, convince healthcare payors that the benefits of the product and its related treatment process outweigh its costs and help train qualified physicists in the skilled use of our products. For example, the complexity and dynamic nature of IMRT and IGRT requires significant education of hospital personnel and physicians regarding the benefits of IMRT and IGRT and the required departures from their customary practices. Further, the complexity and high cost of proton therapy requires similar significant education, as well as education regarding construction and facility requirements. We have expended and will continue to expend significant resources on marketing and educational efforts to create awareness of IMRT, IGRT, stereotactic radiosurgery and proton therapy generally and to encourage acceptance and adoption of our products for IMRT, IGRT, stereotactic radiosurgery and proton therapy. The timing of our competitors’ introduction of products and the market acceptance of their products may also make this educational process more difficult. We cannot be sure that any products we develop will gain any significant market acceptance and market share among physicians, patients and healthcare payors, even if the required regulatory approvals are obtained.  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OR EXPAND OUR BUSINESS IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RETAIN, HIRE AND INTEGRATE SUFFICIENTLY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL  Our future success depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, expand, integrate, train and retain our management team, qualified engineering personnel, technical personnel and sales and marketing staff. The loss of services of key employees could adversely affect our business. Competition for key personnel can be intense. We compete for key personnel with other medical equipment and software manufacturers and technology companies, as well as universities and research institutions. Because the competition for qualified personnel is intense, costs related to compensation could increase significantly if supply decreases or demand increases. If we are unable to hire, train or retain qualified personnel, we will not be able to maintain and expand our business.    57    Table of Contents IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MATCH OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY WITH DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY SUFFER  As a manufacturer of products with a long production cycle, we need to anticipate demand for our products in order to ensure adequate manufacturing or testing capacity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to anticipate demand adequately or to adjust our resources appropriately. If our manufacturing or testing capacity does not keep pace with product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner, which in turn may have a negative effect on our financial results and overall business. Conversely, if demand for our products decreases, the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity may adversely affect our financial results.  WE MAY ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE NEW BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THESE ACQUISITIONS OR TO INTEGRATE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGY OR EMPLOYEES, WE MAY FAIL TO REALIZE EXPECTED BENEFITS OR HARM OUR EXISTING BUSINESS  Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our businesses in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, as a strategy to achieve quicker time to market for new products or technology, or to enter new markets, we may determine to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies rather than through internal development. For example, in fiscal year 2007 we acquired ACCEL, a privately-held German supplier of scientific research instruments and proton therapy systems for cancer treatment, and BIR, a privately-held supplier of X-ray imaging products for security and inspection, and in fiscal year 2008 we acquired Pan-Pacific, an independent distributor of medical X-ray tubes and other imaging components in China. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or successfully complete identified acquisitions. In addition, the completion of an acquisition could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could harm our business and affect our financial results. Furthermore, even if we complete an acquisition, we may not be able to successfully integrate newly acquired organizations, products or technologies or employees into our operations, or may not be able to realize some of the synergies expected from an acquisition. The process of integration could be expensive, time-consuming and may strain our resources. For example, we may encounter challenges in the commercialization of new products and may have to invest more than originally anticipated in order to do so, as we are experiencing with ACCEL’s proton therapy systems. These additional expenditures could be significant and could cause our results of operations to suffer. In many instances, integrating a new business will also involve implementing or improving internal controls appropriate for a public company at a business that lacks them. In addition, we may be unable to retain the employees of acquired companies, or the acquired company’s customers, suppliers, distributors or other partners for a variety of reasons, including the fact that these entities may be our competitors or may have close relationships with our competitors. Further, we may find that we need to restructure or eventually divest acquired businesses or assets of those businesses. We cannot be certain that restructuring activities will produce the full efficiencies and benefits we expect. Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated growth or other benefits from an acquisition, which could harm our existing business. If we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or at all, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than we had anticipated. In this instance, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss on our assets and goodwill, which could adversely affect our business and financial operations. In addition, acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or expenses, or other charges such as in-process research and development, any of which could harm our business and affect our financial results.  We account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. Under this method, we allocate the total purchase price to the acquired businesses’ tangible assets and liabilities, identifiable intangible assets and in-process research and development costs based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition, and record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. If we fail to achieve the anticipated growth from an acquisition, we may be required to write down the value of our intangible assets and goodwill, which may harm of our financial results.  THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LINES OF BUSINESS MAY SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS  From time to time, we may acquire or develop new lines of business, such as proton therapy. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. Risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business, recruiting professionals to manage the new business lines,     58    Table of Contents  increasing research and development expenditures, and developing and capitalizing on new marketing relationships with experienced market participants. Each new business may require the investment of additional capital and the significant involvement of our senior management to acquire or develop, then integrate, the new line of business into our operations. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible, as new products can carry lower gross margins. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact whether implementation of a new line of business will be successful. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  WE UTILIZE DISTRIBUTORS FOR A PORTION OF OUR SALES, THE LOSS OF WHICH COULD HARM OUR REVENUES IN THE TERRITORY SERVICED BY THESE DISTRIBUTORS  We have strategic relationships with a number of key distributors for sales and service of our products, principally in foreign countries. If these strategic relationships are terminated and not replaced, our revenues and/or ability to service our products in the territories serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected.  HEALTHCARE REFORMS, CHANGES IN HEALTHCARE POLICIES AND CHANGES TO THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENTS FOR RADIATION ONCOLOGY SERVICES MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS  The United States government has in the past, and may in the future, consider healthcare policies and proposals intended to curb rising healthcare costs, including those that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services. State and local governments, as well as a number of foreign governments, are also considering or have adopted such policies. These policies have included, and may in the future include, rationing of government-funded reimbursement for healthcare services and imposing price controls on medical products and services providers. Future significant changes in the healthcare systems in the United States or elsewhere, including those that may reduce reimbursement rates for our products or procedures using our products, could have a negative impact on the demand for our products and services and our business. We are unable to predict what healthcare reform legislation or regulations, if any, will be enacted in the United States or elsewhere, whether other healthcare legislation or regulations affecting our business may be proposed or enacted in the future, or what effect any legislation or regulation would have on our business.  In addition, sales of some of our products indirectly depend on whether adequate reimbursement is available to our customers for the treatment provided by those products from third-party healthcare payors, such as government healthcare insurance programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, private insurance plans, health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations. Once Medicare has made a decision to provide reimbursement for a given treatment, these reimbursement rates are generally reviewed and adjusted by Medicare annually. Private third-party payors often adopt Medicare reimbursement policies and payment amounts. As a result, decisions by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to reimburse for a treatment, or changes to Medicare’s reimbursement policies or reductions in payment amounts with respect to a treatment would likely extend to third-party payor reimbursement policies and amounts for that treatment. While we believe reimbursement policies and amounts are not a major factor in our customer purchasing decisions for radiotherapy products, a dramatic change in the availability and amount of reimbursement for treatments using our products could influence our customers’ decisions. Any sharp cuts in overall reimbursement rates for radiotherapy, radiosurgery, proton therapy or brachytherapy could increase uncertainty and reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and stock price.  As a general matter, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical procedures or limiting or prohibiting reimbursement for specific services or devices, and we cannot be sure that they will reimburse our customers at levels sufficient to enable us to achieve or maintain sales and price levels for our products. Without adequate support from third-party payors, the market for our products may be limited. There is no uniform policy on reimbursement among third-party payors, nor can we be sure that procedures using our products will qualify for reimbursement from third-party payors. Foreign governments also have their own healthcare reimbursement systems, and there is an emerging private sector. We cannot be sure that adequate reimbursement will be made available with respect to our products under any foreign reimbursement system.    59    Table of Contents FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS, INCLUDING QUARTERLY NET ORDERS, REVENUES, AND GROSS MARGINS, MAY CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO BE VOLATILE, WHICH COULD CAUSE LOSSES FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS  We have experienced and expect in the future to experience fluctuations in our operating results, including net orders, revenues and gross margins. Many of our products require significant capital expenditures by our customers. Accordingly, individual product orders can be quite large in dollar amounts, which can extend the customer purchasing cycle. We have experienced this with our IGRT products, and expect this to extend to our proton therapy and scientific research instruments products because of the high cost of the equipment and the complexity of project financing. We also expect that orders (and related revenues) for ACCEL scientific research instruments products will vary as they are tied primarily to large, government or national laboratory research projects. Timing of order placement from customers, including those in the government or public sector, and their willingness to commit to purchase products are inherently difficult to predict or forecast. In addition, some of our more sophisticated equipment, such as IGRT and proton therapy products, requires greater site preparation and longer construction cycles, which can delay installation. For proton therapy products, this can delay the customer decision cycles even further. The timing of when individual orders are placed, installation is accomplished and the revenues recognized could have an effect our quarterly results.  Once orders are received, factors that may affect whether these orders become revenues and the timing include:        •    delay in shipment due, for example, to longer construction projects or unanticipated construction delays at customer locations where our products are to be installed, cancellations or rescheduling by customers, extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, port strikes or manufacturing difficulties;        •    delay in the installation and/or acceptance of a product; or        •    a change in a customer’s financial condition or ability to obtain financing.  Our quarterly operating results may also be affected by a number of other factors, including:        •    changes in our or our competitors’ pricing or discount levels;        •    changes or anticipated changes in third-party reimbursement amounts or policies applicable to treatments using our products;        •    revenues becoming affected by seasonal influences;        •    timing of revenue recognition;        •    changes in foreign currency exchange rates;        •    changes in the relative portion of our revenues represented by our various products, including the relative mix between higher margin and lower margin products;        •    changes in the relative portion of our revenues represented by the international region;        •    timing of the announcement, introduction and delivery of new products or product enhancements by us and by our competitors;        •    fluctuation in our effective tax rates resulting from various factors, which may or not be known to us in advance;        •    disruptions in the supply or changes in the costs of raw materials, labor, product components or transportation services;        •    disruptions in our operations, including our ability to manufacture products, caused by events such as earthquakes, fires, floods or terrorist attacks;        •    changes in the general economic conditions or tightening of credit available to our customers in the regions in which we do business;    60    Table of Contents     •    the possibility that unexpected levels of cancellations of orders may affect certain assumptions upon which we base our forecasts and predictions of future performance;        •    the impact of changing levels of sales to sole purchasers of certain of our X-ray products;        •    the unfavorable outcome of any litigation;        •    misleading information in the financial community; and        •    accounting adjustments, such as those relating to accounting reserves for product recalls, reserves for excess and obsolete inventories, share-based compensation expense as required under SFAS 123(R), accounting for income taxes, and adoption of new accounting pronouncements.  Because many of our operating expenses are based on anticipated capacity levels and a high percentage of these expenses are fixed for the short term, a small variation in the timing of revenue recognition can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. Our overall gross margin may also be impacted by the gross margin of our ACCEL products, which are presently below the gross margins for our traditional radiotherapy products. If our gross margins fall below the expectation of securities analysts and investors, the trading price of VMS common stock would almost certainly decline.  We report on a quarterly and annual basis our net orders and backlog. It is important to understand that, unlike revenues, net orders and backlog are not governed by the rules of GAAP, and are not within the scope of the audit or reviews conducted by our independent public accountants; therefore, investors should not interpret our net orders or backlog results in such a manner. Also, our net orders and backlog cannot necessarily be relied upon as accurate predictors of future revenues as the timing of future revenues depends on completion of customer site preparation and construction, installation scheduling, customer capital budgeting and financing, appropriate regulatory authorizations and other factors. Unexpected levels of cancellation of orders or delays in customer purchase decisions or delivery dates will reduce the quarterly net orders results and backlog and also affect the level of future revenues. Accordingly, we cannot be sure if or when orders will mature into revenues. Our net orders, backlog and revenues in one or more future periods may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the trading price of VMS common stock would almost certainly decline.  THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OUR PROTON THERAPY AND RESEARCH INSTRUMENTS BUSINESS MAY FLUCTUATE AND BE UNPREDICTABLE  The proton therapy and scientific research instruments projects of our ACCEL business are highly customized and vary in size and complexity. Planning for these projects will take more time and use more resources than those in the radiotherapy business conducted in our Oncology Systems segment. Due to its relatively large scale, the construction of a proton therapy facility requires significant capital investment and may involve complex project financing. If we are required to establish special purpose entities to finance and manage a proton therapy project, we may be required to consolidate these special purpose entities in our financial statements, or guarantee performance and assume liabilities that are in excess of the project value, which could negatively impact our financial results. In the scientific research instruments market, projects are generally publicly funded, and decisions on new projects or project upgrades are subject to public and political factors. Therefore, sales and customer decision cycles may take several years. As a result, the timing of proton therapy and scientific research instruments projects may vary significantly from period to period, and our operating results and stock price may be adversely affected.  In addition, many of the components used in proton therapy equipment require a long lead time, which may translate into an increase in our levels of inventory. This may cause fluctuations in the operating results of our Proton Therapy and Research Instruments business that may make it difficult to predict our operating results and to compare our financial results from period to period. This could have an adverse effect on our stock price.  Moreover, entrance into the proton therapy and scientific research instruments business may subject us to increased risk and potential liability. For example, because proton therapy projects are large in scale and require detailed project planning, failure to deliver on our commitments could result in greater than expected liabilities, as we could be required to indemnify business partners and customers for losses suffered or incurred if we are unable to deliver our products in accordance with the terms of customer contracts. These indemnification arrangements would be limited to a percentage of the value of the project; however, due to the high dollar value of proton therapy projects, the liability that we would assume may nevertheless be substantial. Additionally, while the proton therapy market is still developing and technology efficacy of proton therapy as an accepted treatment modality being established, customers are requesting that the systems vendor, as the primary     61    Table of Contents  technology provider, provide guarantees for and suffer penalties in relation to the overall construction project. Since each proton therapy center project may cost up to $100 million, the amount of potential liability may be higher than the levels historically assumed by us for our traditional radiation therapy business. Insurance covering these contingencies may be unobtainable. If we cannot reasonably mitigate or eliminate these contingencies, our ability to competitively bid upon proton center projects will be negatively impacted and we may be required to assume material amounts of potential liability, all of which may have adverse consequences to our Proton Therapy business. In addition, we have encountered and may encounter additional challenges in the commercialization of the proton therapy products, which may increase our research and development costs and delay the introduction of our products. This and other unanticipated events could adversely affect our business and make our results of operations unpredictable.  WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF UPGRADING AND MODIFING OUR ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING AND OTHER KEY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE UNEXPECTED PROBLEMS TO OCCUR AND COULD DISRUPT THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS  We are in the process of upgrading and modifying the enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system used for our worldwide operations, as well as other key software applications used in our global operations. Our ERP system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records, record transactions, manage our personnel records, provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements. The planned upgrade involves some process re-engineering, and may eventually become more costly, difficult and time-consuming to purchase and implement than we currently anticipate. In addition, we may encounter unexpected difficulties, costs or other challenges with this upgrade and any modifications, any of which may disrupt our business, divert management time, cause us to incur additional costs or result in significant deficiencies or material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Corrections and improvements may be required as we upgrade and modify our systems, procedures and controls, and could cause us to delay the project, incur additional costs and require additional management attention, placing burdens on our internal resources. If we fail to manage these changes effectively, it could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and, as a further consequence, affect our operating results. Moreover, we have capitalized the costs associated with this upgrade on our financial statements. If this project is not successful and cannot be completed, we would have to recognize the costs associated with the project as operating expenses in the quarter that we realize that it cannot be completed. This expense recognition would have an adverse impact on our operating results, and our stock performance could suffer.  WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT THAT RESTRICTS CERTAIN ACTIVITIES AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS AGREEMENT MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION   We maintain a revolving credit facility that contains restrictive financial covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. We may have to curtail some of our operations to maintain compliance with these covenants. In addition, our revolving credit facility contains other affirmative and negative covenants that could restrict our operating and financing activities. These provisions limit our ability to, among other things, incur future indebtedness, contingent obligations or liens, guarantee indebtedness, make certain investments and capital expenditures, sell stock or assets and pay dividends, and consummate certain mergers or acquisitions. Because of the restrictions on our ability to create or assume liens, we may have difficulty securing additional financing in the form of additional indebtedness. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with these covenants, requirements or any other provision of the credit facility, we may be in default under the credit facility, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary amendments or waivers of a default. Upon an event of default under our credit facility not otherwise amended or waived, the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot assure you that we will be able to make those payments or borrow sufficient funds from alternative sources to make those payments. Even if we were to obtain additional financing, that financing may be on unfavorable terms.  CHANGES IN INTERPRETATION OR APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS  We prepare our financial statements to conform with GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and various other regulatory or accounting bodies. A change in interpretations of, or our application of, these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. Additionally, as we are required to adopt new     62    Table of Contents  accounting standards, our methods of accounting for certain items may change, which could cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period. For example, as a result of our adoption of FIN 48, our effective tax rate and other related financial metrics have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate more than they have in prior periods.  As our operations evolve over time, we may introduce new products or new technologies that require us to apply different accounting principles, including those regarding revenue recognition, than we had applied in past periods. For example, if we develop products that contain more software components, we may be required to recognize revenue for the software components together with the hardware components in accordance with software revenue recognition rules, which could delay recognition of some revenue. Additionally, while we recognize revenue for many of our Oncology Systems products in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 Revenue Recognition and SOP No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98-9, Software Revenue Recognition with Respect to Certain Agreements, we recognize revenues using the percentage-of-completion method for certain contracts for products and services in the ACCEL Proton Therapy and Research Instruments businesses and certain products and services in the SIP business, in accordance with SOP 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Product Type Contracts, which will affect the timing of revenue recognition. Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract. If a loss is expected on a contract, the estimated loss would be charged to cost of sales in the period the loss is identified. Because the percentage-of-completion method involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning dollar amounts to relevant accounting periods, and because the estimates must be periodically reviewed and appropriately adjusted, if our estimates are not accurate or circumstances change over time, we would be required to adjust revenues or even record a contract loss, and our financial results could suffer. While we currently apply the percentage-of-completion method of accounting to certain contracts for products and services in the Proton Therapy and Research Instruments businesses and certain products and services in the SIP business, we could be required to apply them to other businesses in the future. The application of different types of accounting principles and related potential adjustments may make it more difficult to compare our financial results from quarter to quarter, and the trading price of VMS common stock could suffer or become more volatile as a result.  THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS EXPOSES US TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, CLEANUP COSTS, OR EXPENSES, WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO PAY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS   We are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling, storage, transport and disposal of hazardous materials and which impose liability for the cleanup of any contamination from these materials; these laws may create increased costs for some of our operations. Although we follow procedures that we consider appropriate under existing regulations, these procedures can be costly and we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these hazardous materials; in the event of such an incident, we could be held liable for any damages that result. We do not maintain insurance for clean up costs or third-party claims resulting from environmental contamination which could occur in the future. We do, however, maintain insurance policies that may provide coverage for cleanup costs or third-party claims resulting from some historical occurrences of environmental contamination although this insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover these costs or claims. We could also be assessed fines or penalties for failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations.  In addition, we may be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with future changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or new laws and regulations. For example, several countries, including many in the EU, are requiring medical equipment manufacturers to bear some or all of the cost of product disposal at the end of the products’ useful life, thus creating increased costs for our operations. The EU has also adopted a directive that may require the adoption of restrictions on the use of some hazardous substances in certain of our products sold in the EU. This directive could create increased costs for our operations. All of these costs, and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business.    63    Table of Contents AS A STRATEGY TO ASSIST OUR SALES EFFORTS, WE MAY OFFER EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS, WHICH MAY POTENTIALLY RESULT IN HIGHER DSO AND GREATER PAYMENT DEFAULTS  We offer longer or extended payment terms for qualified customers in some circumstances. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, customer contracts with longer or extended payment terms amounted to approximately 1% of total Oncology Systems revenues. While we qualify customers to whom we offer longer or extended payment terms, we cannot assure you that the financial positions of these customers will not change adversely over the longer time period given for payment. In such an event, we may experience an increase in payment defaults in our accounts receivable, which will affect our net earnings. Also, longer or extended payment terms have and may in the future result in an increase in our days sales outstanding.  OUR OPERATIONS ARE VULNERABLE TO INTERRUPTION OR LOSS DUE TO NATURAL OR OTHER DISASTERS, POWER LOSS, STRIKES AND OTHER EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS  We conduct a significant portion of our activities, including manufacturing, administration and data processing at facilities located in the State of California and other seismically active areas that have experienced major earthquakes in the past, as well as other disasters. We carry limited earthquake insurance. This coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. A major earthquake or other disaster affecting our facilities (such as a major fire, flood or terrorist attack), or those of our suppliers, could significantly disrupt our operations, and delay or prevent product manufacture and shipment during the time required to repair, rebuild or replace our or our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities; these delays could be lengthy and result in large expenses. If any of our customers’ facilities are adversely affected by a disaster, shipments of our products could be delayed even further. In addition, our facilities, particularly those located in the western states of the United States, may be subject to a shortage of available electrical power and other energy supplies. Any shortages may increase our costs for power and energy supplies or could result in blackouts, which could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities and harm our business. Further, our products are typically shipped from a limited number of ports, and any disaster, strike or other event blocking shipment from these ports could delay or prevent shipments and harm our business.  THE EFFECT OF TERRORISM OR AN OUTBREAK OF EPIDEMIC DISEASES MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT SALES AND HINDER OUR OPERATIONS  Concerns about terrorism, the effects of a terrorist attack or an outbreak of epidemic diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Avian Influenza (especially in our major markets of North America or Europe) could have a negative effect on our business operations, those of our suppliers and customers, and the ability to travel, resulting in adverse consequences on our revenues and financial performance.  OUR STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN AND PROVISIONS OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION MAY DISCOURAGE A TAKE-OVER AND THEREFORE LIMIT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK; WHEN OUR STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN EXPIRES, WE COULD FACE A HIGHER RISK OF A TAKEOVER  We have a stockholder rights plan that, under specific circumstances, would significantly dilute the equity interest in our company of a person (or persons) seeking to acquire control of our company without the prior approval of our Board of Directors. Our Certificate of Incorporation also includes provisions that may make an acquisition of control of our company without the approval of our Board of Directors more difficult. This stockholder rights plan and provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation may discourage take-over attempts and limit the price of VMS common stock. Our stockholder rights plan expires in November 2008. We may not be able to implement a similar stockholder rights plan, which could put us at risk for a take-over, distract our management and adversely affect our business.    64    Table of Contents   Item 2.
