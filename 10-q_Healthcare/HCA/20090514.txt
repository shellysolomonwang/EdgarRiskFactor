Item 1A:    Risk Factors       Reference is made to the factors set forth under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q and other risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, which are incorporated herein by reference. There have not been any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K, except as set forth below.     Changes in governmental programs may reduce our revenues.     A significant portion of our patient volumes is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. We derived approximately 59% of our admissions from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2008. In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under these government programs. National health care    36    Table of Contents   reform is a focus at the federal level, and we anticipate that it will remain a focus in the near term. Several states are also considering health care reform measures. This focus on health care reform may increase the likelihood of significant changes affecting government health care programs. Possible future changes in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other state programs, may reduce reimbursements to health care providers and insurers and may also increase our operating costs, which could reduce our profitability.     CMS issued final regulations effective January 1, 2008 that increased ASC payment groups from nine clinically disparate payment groups to an extensive list of covered surgical procedures among the APCs used under the outpatient PPS for these surgical services. CMS estimates that the payment rates for procedures performed in an ASC setting equal 65% of the corresponding rates paid for the same procedures performed in an outpatient hospital setting. The final regulation establishes a four-year transition period for implementing the revised payment rates. This regulation significantly expands the number of procedures that Medicare reimburses if performed in an ASC and limits ASC reimbursement for procedures commonly performed in physicians’ offices. More Medicare procedures that are now performed in hospitals, such as ours, may be moved to ASCs, reducing surgical volume in our hospitals. Also, more Medicare procedures that are now performed in ASCs, such as ours, may be moved to physicians’ offices. Commercial third-party payers may adopt similar policies.     On August 22, 2007, CMS issued a final rule for federal fiscal year 2008 for hospital inpatient PPS. This rule adopts a two-year implementation of MS-DRGs, a Medicare severity-adjusted diagnosis related group system. This change represents a refinement to the existing Medicare DRG system. Realignments in the DRG system could impact the margins we receive for certain services. For federal fiscal year 2009, CMS has provided a 3.6% market basket update for hospitals that submit certain quality patient care indicators and a 1.6% update for hospitals that do not submit this data. While we will endeavor to comply with all quality data submission requirements, our submissions may not be deemed timely or sufficient to entitle us to the full market basket adjustment for all of our hospitals. Medicare payments to hospitals in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 have been reduced to eliminate what CMS estimates will be the effect of coding or classifications changes as a result of hospitals implementing the MS-DRG system. CMS may retrospectively determine if the adjustment levels for federal fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were adequate and may impose an adjustment in future years if CMS finds that the adjustment was inadequate. Additionally, Medicare payments to hospitals are subject to a number of other adjustments, and the actual impact on payments to specific hospitals may vary. In some cases, commercial third-party payers and other payers such as some state Medicaid programs rely on all or portions of the Medicare DRG system to determine payment rates, and adjustments that negatively impact Medicare payments may also negatively impact payments from Medicaid programs or commercial third-party payers and other payers. CMS announced proposed rates and payment adjustments for the hospital inpatient PPS for federal fiscal year 2010 that, if finalized, may reduce payments to hospitals. If implemented, these payment adjustments may adversely affect the results of our operations.     Since most states must operate with balanced budgets and since the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. The current economic downturn has increased the budgetary pressures on most states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted and likely will continue to result in decreased spending for Medicaid programs in many states. Further, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage and program eligibility, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems.     On May 1, 2009, the Department of Defense implemented a prospective payment system for hospital outpatient services furnished to TRICARE beneficiaries similar to that utilized for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. Because the Medicare outpatient prospective payment system APC rates have historically been below TRICARE rates, the adoption of this payment methodology for TRICARE beneficiaries will reduce our reimbursement. This change in TRICARE will have a material impact on our revenues from this program; however, TRICARE outpatient services do not represent a significant portion of our patient volumes. The TRICARE outpatient payment rule was reopened for comment during the first quarter of 2009, but only minor modifications to the new outpatient payment system were made.    37    Table of Contents   Changes in laws or regulations regarding government health programs or other changes in the administration of government health programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
