Item 1A:    Risk Factors       Reference is made to the factors set forth under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q and other risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, which are incorporated herein by reference. There have not been any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, except as set forth below.     Changes in government health care programs may reduce our revenues.     A significant portion of our patient volume is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid. Specifically, we derived approximately 41% of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2010. Changes in government health care programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.     In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under the Medicare program. For example, CMS completed a two-year transition to full implementation of the Medicare severity diagnosis-related group (“MS-DRG”) system, which represents a refinement to the existing diagnosis-related group system. Future realignments in the MS-DRG system could impact the margins we receive for certain services. Further, the Health Reform Law provides for material reductions in the growth of Medicare program spending, including reductions in Medicare market basket updates and Medicare disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) funding. Medicare payments in federal fiscal year 2011 for inpatient hospital services are expected to be slightly lower than payments for the same services in federal fiscal year 2010, because of reductions resulting from the Health Reform Law and the MS-DRG implementation. CMS has issued a proposed rule that, if implemented, would result in a slight decrease to Medicare reimbursement for inpatient hospital services in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011.     Since most states must operate with balanced budgets and since the Medicaid program is often a state’s largest program, some states can be expected to enact or consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. The current economic downturn has increased the budgetary pressures on many states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted, and likely will continue to result, in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs and the Children’s Health Insurance Program in many states. For example, in May 2011, the Florida legislature announced a budget agreement for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2011 that would reduce Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals. If this reduction is signed into law, we estimate that Florida Medicaid payments to our hospitals may be reduced by approximately $25 million dollars in the second half of calendar year      43    Table of Contents    2011 and by another approximately $25 million in the first half of calendar year 2012. The Health Reform Law provides for material reductions to Medicaid DSH funding. Further, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. Effective March 23, 2010, the Health Reform Law requires states to at least maintain Medicaid eligibility standards established prior to the enactment of the law for adults until January 1, 2014 and for children until October 1, 2019. However, states with budget deficits may seek a waiver from this requirement to address eligibility standards that apply to adults making more than 133% of the federal poverty level. The Health Reform Law also provides for significant expansions to the Medicaid program, but these changes are not required until 2014. In addition, the Health Reform Law will result in increased state legislative and regulatory changes in order for states to comply with new federal mandates, such as the requirement to establish Exchanges, and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities.     In some cases, commercial third-party payers rely on all or portions of the MS-DRG system to determine payment rates, which may result in decreased reimbursement from some commercial third-party payers. Other changes to government health care programs may negatively impact payments from commercial third-party payers.     Current or future health care reform efforts, changes in laws or regulations regarding government health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care programs and changes to commercial third-party payers in response to health care reform and other changes to government health care programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.           Item 2:    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds       During the first quarter of 2011, we issued and sold 457,027 shares of common stock in connection with the cashless exercise of stock options for aggregate consideration of $1,293,478 resulting in 277,427 net settled shares. We also issued and sold 10,879 shares of common stock in connection with the cash exercise of stock options for aggregate consideration of $30,791. The shares were issued without registration in reliance on the exemptions afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 701 promulgated thereunder.     Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities     On March 15, 2011, we completed an initial public offering covered by the Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-171369) of 145,130,000 shares of common stock, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares, for cash consideration of $30.00 per share ($28.9125 per share, net of underwriting discounts) to a syndicate of underwriters led by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. We sold 87,719,300 shares for approximately $2.5 billion in net proceeds before expenses, and the selling stockholders sold 57,410,700 shares for approximately $1.7 billion in net proceeds before expenses. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling stockholders. We incurred approximately $95 million in underwriter discounts and an estimated $33 million of fees and expenses in connection with our initial public offering, which included a $26 million fee paid to affiliates of each of Bain Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and BAML Capital Partners (formerly Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity) and certain members of the Frist family, including Thomas F. Frist, Jr., M.D., Thomas F. Frist III and William R. Frist (the “Investors”), each of whom have an indirect interest in more than 10% of our capital stock through their investment in Hercules Holding II, LLC and certain members of whom serve on our board of directors, pursuant to a management agreement among HCA Inc. and the Investors. We also paid the Investors an additional final fee of $181 million in connection with the termination of the management agreement which occurred upon completion of the initial public offering of our common stock.     As contemplated in our Prospectus, dated March 9, 2011, filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, we used approximately $2.5 billion of the proceeds from our initial public offering to temporarily repay indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facilities, pending more permanent application of the proceeds.     44    Table of Contents          Item 5:    Other Information       Our Bylaws were amended and restated as of March 9, 2011 in connection with the pricing of the initial public offering of our common stock, to, among other things, provide that stockholders seeking to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring business before an annual or special meeting of stockholders must provide timely notice of their proposal in writing to the secretary of the Company. Generally, to be timely, a stockholder’s notice must be delivered to, mailed or received at our principal executive offices, addressed to the secretary of the Company, and within the following time periods:              •   in the case of an annual meeting, no earlier than 120 days and no later than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however, that if (A) the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days, or delayed by more than 60 days, from the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting, or (B) no annual meeting was held during the preceding year, to be timely the stockholder notice must be received no earlier than 120 days before such annual meeting and no later than the later of 90 days before such annual meeting or the tenth day after the day on which public disclosure of the date of such meeting is first made; and         •   in the case of a nomination of a person or persons for election to the Board of Directors at a special meeting of the stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, no earlier than 120 days before such special meeting and no later than the later of 90 days before such annual or special meeting or the tenth day after the day on which public disclosure of the date of such meeting is first made.       In no event shall an adjournment, postponement or deferral, or public disclosure of an adjournment, postponement or deferral, of a meeting of the stockholders commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of the stockholder notice.
