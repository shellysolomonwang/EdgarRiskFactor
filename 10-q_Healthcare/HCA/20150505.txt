In addition to the director compensation described above, each independent director will receive an annual board equity award with a value of $175,000, awarded upon joining the Board of Directors (prorated at the time of hire for months of service) and at each annual meeting of the stockholders thereafter. These equity grants consist of restricted share units ultimately payable in shares of our common stock. These restricted share units vest as to 100% of the award on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to the director’s continued service on our Board of Directors. The restricted share units will also immediately vest upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the applicable grant agreement). The directors may elect to defer receipt of shares under the restricted share units. Directors will also be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses incurred in connection with their service.    46    Table of Contents ITEM 6. EXHIBITS
