Item 1A:    Risk Factors       Reference is made to the factors set forth under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q and other risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are incorporated herein by reference. There have not been any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K other than as set forth below.     Changes In Governmental Interpretations May Negatively Impact Our Ability To Obtain Reimbursement Of Medicare Bad Debts.     The Medicare program will reimburse 70% of bad debts related to deductibles and coinsurance for patients with Medicare coverage, after the provider has made a reasonable effort to collect these amounts. On March 30, 2006, the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan entered a final order in Battle Creek Health System v. Thompson, which provided that reasonable collection efforts have not been satisfied as long as the Medicare accounts remained with an external collection agency. The case was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. A decision adverse to Battle Creek was issued on August 14, 2007. We utilize extensive in-house and external collection efforts for our accounts receivable, including deductible and coinsurance amounts owed by patients with Medicare coverage. We utilize a secondary collection agency after in-house and primary collection agency efforts have been unsuccessful. We have modified our accounts receivable collection processes to provide us with reasonable collection results and comply with CMS’s interpretation of reasonable collection efforts. Possible future changes in judicial and administrative interpretations of laws and regulations governing Medicare could disrupt our collections processes, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.     Changes In Governmental Programs May Reduce Our Revenues.     A significant portion of our patient volumes is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. We derived approximately 58% of our admissions from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2006. In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under these government programs. Possible future changes in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other state programs, including Medicaid supplement payments pursuant to UPL programs, may impact reimbursements to health care providers and insurers. Such changes may also increase our operating costs, which could reduce our profitability.     Effective January 1, 2007, as a result of the federal Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (“DRA 2005”), reimbursements for ambulatory surgery center (“ASC”) overhead costs are limited to no more than the overhead costs paid to hospital outpatient departments under the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system for the same procedure. On August 2, 2007, CMS issued final regulations that change payment for procedures performed in an ASC, effective January 1, 2008. Under this rule, ASC payment groups will increase from the current nine clinically disparate payment groups to the 221 Ambulatory Procedure Classification groups (“APCs”) used under the outpatient prospective payment system for these surgical services. CMS estimates that the rates for procedures performed in an ASC setting will equal 65% of the corresponding rates paid for the same procedures performed in an outpatient hospital setting. Moreover, if CMS determines that a procedure is commonly performed in a    43    Table of Contents   physician’s office, the ASC reimbursement for that procedure will be limited to the reimbursement allowable under the Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule. In addition, all surgical procedures, other than those that pose a significant safety risk or generally require an overnight stay, will be payable as ASC procedures. This will expand the number of procedures that Medicare will pay for if performed in an ASC. Because the new payment system will have a significant impact on payments for certain procedures, the final rule establishes a four-year transition period for implementing the revised payment rates. More Medicare procedures that are now performed in hospitals, such as ours, may be moved to ASCs reducing surgical volume in our hospitals. Also, more Medicare procedures that are now performed in ASCs, such as ours, may be moved to physicians’ offices. Commercial third-party payers may adopt similar policies.     On August 1, 2007, CMS announced a final rule for federal fiscal year 2008 for the hospital inpatient prospective payment system. This rule adopts a two-year implementation of Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Groups (“MS-DRGs”), a severity-adjusted diagnosis-related group system. This change represents a refinement to the existing diagnosis-related group (“DRG”) system, making its impact on revenue difficult to predict. Realignments in the DRG system could impact the margins we receive for certain services. This rule provides for a 3.3% market basket update for hospitals that submit certain quality patient care indicators and a 1.3% update for hospitals that do not submit this data. While we will endeavor to comply with all data submission requirements, our submissions may not be deemed timely or sufficient to entitle us to the full market basket adjustment for all of our hospitals. Medicare payments to hospitals in federal fiscal year 2008 will be reduced by 0.6% to eliminate what CMS estimates will be the effect of coding or classification changes as a result of hospitals implementing the MS-DRG system. This “documentation and coding adjustment” will increase to 0.9% for federal fiscal year 2009. For federal fiscal year 2010 and subsequent years, in the process of rate setting, CMS will be able to evaluate actual claims data from experience with the MS-DRG system. This evaluation of changes in case-mix based on actual claims data may yield a higher documentation and coding adjustment thereby potentially reducing our revenues and impacting our results of operations in ways that cannot be quantified at this time. Additionally, Medicare payments to hospitals are subject to a number of other adjustments, and the actual impact on payments to specific hospitals may vary. In some cases, commercial third-party payers rely on all or portions of the Medicare DRG system to determine payment rates. The change from traditional Medicare DRGs to MS-DRGs could adversely impact those rates if commercial third-party payers adopt MS-DRGs.     Hospital operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under pressure because of deterioration in pricing flexibility and payer mix, and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payment system payments under the Medicare program.     Since states must operate with balanced budgets and since the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. DRA 2005 includes Medicaid cuts of approximately $4.8 billion over five years. On May 29, 2007, CMS published a final rule entitled “Medicaid Program; Cost Limit for Providers Operated by Units of Government and Provisions to Ensure the Integrity of Federal-State Financial Partnership.” A moratorium was placed on this rule, delaying its implementation until 2008. However, when the moratorium expires next year, this final rule could significantly impact state Medicaid programs. In its proposed form, this rule was expected to reduce federal Medicaid funding by $12.2 billion over five years. As a result of the moratorium on implementing the final rule, the impact of the final rule has not been quantified. States have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage and program eligibility, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. Future legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of government health programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.     We May Be Subject To Liabilities From Claims By The IRS.     We are currently contesting certain claimed deficiencies and adjustments proposed by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) in connection with its examinations of prior year federal income tax returns for HCA and certain affiliates that are treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes (“affiliated partnerships”). The disputed items include the deductibility of a portion of the 2001 and 2003 government settlement payments, the timing of recognition of certain patient service revenues in 2001 through 2004, the method for calculating the tax allowance for doubtful accounts in 2002 through 2004, and the amount of insurance expense deducted in 2001 and 2002. See    44    Table of Contents   “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Pending IRS Disputes.”     Through September 30, 2007, the IRS is seeking an additional $1.4 billion in federal income taxes, interest and penalties with respect to these issues. These amounts are net of a refundable deposit of $215 million that we made in 2006. The IRS has not determined the final amount of additional income tax, interest and penalties that it may claim upon completion of current or future examinations.     We believe that HCA and the affiliated partnerships properly reported taxable income in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS and that adequate provisions have been recorded to satisfy final resolution of the disputed issues. However, if payments due upon final resolution of these issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.      Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds      During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, HCA issued 14,862 shares of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options for aggregate consideration of $189,491. The shares were issued without registration in reliance on the exemptions afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Rule 701 promulgated thereunder.     HCA recently completed exchange offers pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4; as disclosed in the prospectus relating thereto, we did not receive any cash proceeds from the exchange offers.
