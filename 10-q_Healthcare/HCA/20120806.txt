ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS  Reference is made to the factors set forth under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q and other risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, which are incorporated herein by reference. There have not been any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, except as set forth below.  The growth of uninsured and patient due accounts and a deterioration in the collectibility of these accounts could adversely affect our results of operations.  The primary collection risks of our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (exclusions, deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Although Medicare reimburses hospitals for a portion of Medicare bad debts, the Jobs Creation Act will reduce the reimbursement level from 70% of eligible bad debts to 65% beginning in federal fiscal year 2013.  The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of historical write-offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal and state governmental and private employer health care coverage, the rate of growth in uninsured patient admissions and other collection indicators. At June 30, 2012, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 92% of the $4.805 billion patient due accounts receivable balance. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care increased from $5.331 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2011 to $6.625 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2012.  A continuation of the trends that have resulted in an increasing proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured accounts and a deterioration in the collectibility of these accounts will adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations. We may also be adversely affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts as a result of increases in the adoption of plan structures, including health savings accounts, that shift greater responsibility for care to individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and deductible amounts. Our facilities may experience growth in bad debts, uninsured discounts and    51    Table of Contents  charity care as a result of a number of factors, including the economic downturn and continued high unemployment. The Health Reform Law seeks to decrease, over time, the number of uninsured individuals through reforms that mostly will become effective January 1, 2014. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate provisions of the Health Reform Law but struck down the provisions that would have allowed HHS to penalize states that do not implement the Medicaid expansion provisions with the loss of existing federal Medicaid funding. As a result, states may choose not to implement the Medicaid expansion. Thus, even after full implementation of the Health Reform Law, we may continue to experience bad debts and have to provide uninsured discounts and charity care for individuals residing in states that choose not to implement the Medicaid expansion. We may also continue to experience bad debts and have to provide uninsured discounts and charity care for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in a health insurance exchange or government health care programs and certain others who may not have insurance coverage. Further, implementation of the Health Reform Law could result in some patients terminating their current insurance plans in favor of lower cost Medicaid plans or other insurance coverage with lower reimbursement levels. Patient responsibility accounts may continue to increase even with expanded health plan coverage as a result of increases in plan exclusions and deductibles and copayment amounts.  It is difficult to predict the full impact of the Health Reform Law due to the law’s complexity, lack of implementing regulations or interpretive guidance, gradual and potentially delayed implementation, court challenges and possible amendment or repeal, as well as our inability to foresee how individuals, states and businesses will respond to the choices afforded them by the law.  Changes in government health care programs may adversely affect our revenues.  A significant portion of our patient volume is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid. Specifically, we derived 44.1% of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs for the six months ended June 30, 2012. Changes in government health care programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under the Medicare program. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “BCA”) provides for new spending on program integrity initiatives intended to reduce fraud and abuse under the Medicare program. The BCA requires automatic spending reductions of $1.2 trillion for federal fiscal years 2013 through 2021, minus any deficit reductions enacted by Congress and debt service costs. However, the percentage reduction for Medicare may not be more than 2% for a fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. We are unable to predict how these spending reductions will be structured, what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress or whether Congress will attempt to suspend or restructure the automatic budget cuts.  These reductions will be in addition to reductions mandated by the Health Reform Law, which provides for material reductions in the growth of Medicare program spending, including reductions in Medicare market basket updates and Medicare DSH funding. Further, from time to time, CMS revises the reimbursement systems used to reimburse health care providers, including changes to the MS-DRG system and other payment systems, which may result in reduced Medicare payments.  Since most states must operate with balanced budgets and since the Medicaid program is often a state’s largest program, some states have enacted or may consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Further, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. The current economic environment has increased the budgetary pressures on many states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted, and likely will continue to result, in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs and the Children’s Health Insurance Program in many states. Some states that provide Medicaid supplemental payments are reviewing these programs    52    Table of Contents  or have filed waiver requests with CMS to replace these programs, which could result in Medicaid supplemental payments being reduced or eliminated. CMS approved a Medicaid waiver in December 2011 that allows Texas to continue receiving supplemental Medicaid reimbursement while expanding its Medicaid managed care program. However, we cannot predict whether the Texas private supplemental Medicaid Waiver Program will continue or guarantee that revenues recognized from the program will not decrease.  The Health Reform Law made changes to the Medicaid program and will likely cause additional changes in the future. For example, the Health Reform Law provides for material reductions to Medicaid DSH funding. The Health Reform Law will result in increased state legislative and regulatory changes in order for states to comply with new federal mandates, such as the requirement to establish Exchanges, and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities. Effective March 23, 2010, the Health Reform Law requires states to maintain Medicaid eligibility standards established prior to the enactment of the law for adults until January 1, 2014 and for children until October 1, 2019. However, states with budget deficits may seek a waiver from this requirement to address eligibility standards that apply to adults making more than 133% of the federal poverty level. The Health Reform Law also provides for significant expansions to the Medicaid program in 2014. However, in its June 28, 2012 ruling, the United States Supreme Court struck down the portion of the Health Reform Law that would have allowed HHS to penalize states that do not implement the Medicaid expansion provisions with the loss of existing federal Medicaid funding. Thus, states may opt not to implement the expansion.  In some cases, commercial third-party payers rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from commercial third-party payers.  Current or future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts, changes in laws or regulations regarding government health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care programs and changes to commercial third-party payers in response to health care reform and other changes to government health care programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.  We are unable to predict the impact of the Health Reform Law, which represents a significant change to the health care industry.  As enacted, the Health Reform Law will change how health care services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed through expanded coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments and the establishment of programs where reimbursement is tied to quality and integration. In addition, the law reforms certain aspects of health insurance, expands existing efforts to tie Medicare and Medicaid payments to performance and quality, and contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement. Further, the Health Reform Law provides for a value-based purchasing program, the establishment of Accountable Care Organizations (“ACOs”) and bundled payment pilot programs, which may create sources of additional revenue. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate provisions of the Health Reform Law but struck down the provisions that would have allowed HHS to penalize states that do not implement the Medicaid expansion provisions with the loss of existing federal Medicaid funding. States that choose not to implement the Medicaid expansion will forego funding established by the Health Reform Law to cover most of the expansion costs. While the expansion of health insurance coverage under the Health Reform Law may result in a material increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage, it is unclear how many states will decline to implement the Medicaid expansion. Those states with relatively low income eligibility requirements for Medicaid may have the greatest financial incentives to implement the Medicaid expansion. The Company has a significant presence in several of these low income eligibility states, including Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia. However, the governors of a number of states, including Florida and Texas, in which approximately one-half of the Company’s licensed beds are located, have announced their intentions to opt out of expanding their Medicaid programs pursuant to the Health Reform Law. These statements are not legally binding and may be subject to change.    53    Table of Contents It is difficult to predict the size of the potential revenue gains to the Company as a result of these elements of the Health Reform Law, because of uncertainty surrounding a number of material factors, including the following:        •    how many states will implement the Medicaid expansion provisions and under what terms;        •    how many previously uninsured individuals will obtain coverage as a result of the Health Reform Law (prior to the Supreme Court ruling, the Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”) estimated 30 million by 2016 and 33 million by 2021, and CMS estimated almost 34 million by 2019, with both agencies making a number of assumptions. In a report that reflects the Supreme Court decision and assumes that some states will not expand Medicaid coverage or will do so after 2014, the CBO estimates 26 million in 2016 and 30 million by 2021. CMS has not released estimates that take into account the Supreme Court decision);        •    what percentage of the newly insured patients will be covered under the Medicaid program and what percentage will be covered by private health insurers;        •    the extent to which states will enroll new Medicaid participants in managed care programs;        •    the pace at which insurance coverage expands, including the pace of different types of coverage expansion;        •    the change, if any, in the volume of inpatient and outpatient hospital services that are sought by and provided to previously uninsured individuals;        •    the rate paid to hospitals by private payers for newly covered individuals, including those covered through the newly created Exchanges and those who might be covered under the Medicaid program under contracts with the state;        •    the rate paid by state governments under the Medicaid program for newly covered individuals;        •    the effect of the value-based purchasing program on our hospitals’ revenues and the effects of other quality programs;        •    the percentage of individuals in the Exchanges who select the high deductible plans, since health insurers offering those kinds of products have traditionally sought to pay lower rates to hospitals;        •    whether the net effect of the Health Reform Law, including the prohibition on excluding individuals based on pre-existing conditions, the requirement to keep medical costs at or above a specified minimum percentage of premium revenue, other health insurance reforms and the annual fee applied to all health insurers, will be to put pressure on the bottom line of health insurers, which in turn might cause them to seek to reduce payments to hospitals with respect to both newly insured individuals and their existing business; and        •    the possibility that the Health Reform Law or components of it will be delayed, revised or eliminated as a result of other court challenges and efforts to repeal or amend the law. Repeal of the Health Reform Law has become a theme in political campaigns during this election year.  On the other hand, the Health Reform Law provides for significant reductions in the growth of Medicare spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments and the establishment of programs where reimbursement is tied to quality and integration. Since 44.1% of our revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2012 were from Medicare and Medicaid, reductions to these programs may significantly impact the Company and could offset any positive effects of the Health Reform Law. It is difficult to predict the size of the revenue reductions to Medicare and Medicaid spending because of uncertainty regarding a number of material factors, including the following:        •    the amount of overall revenues the Company will generate from Medicare and Medicaid business when the reductions are implemented;    54    Table of Contents     •    whether reductions required by the Health Reform Law will be changed by statute or by judicial decision prior to becoming effective;        •    the size of the Health Reform Law’s annual productivity adjustment to the market basket;        •    the amount of the Medicare DSH reductions that will be made, commencing in federal fiscal year 2014;        •    the allocation to our hospitals of the Medicaid DSH reductions, commencing in federal fiscal year 2014;        •    what the losses in revenues will be, if any, from the Health Reform Law’s quality initiatives;        •    how successful ACOs will be at coordinating care and reducing costs or whether they will decrease reimbursement;        •    the scope and nature of potential changes to Medicare reimbursement methods, such as an emphasis on bundling payments or coordination of care programs;        •    whether the Company’s revenues from UPL programs, or other Medicaid supplemental programs developed through a federally approved waiver program (“Waiver Program”), will be adversely affected because there may be reductions in available state and local government funding for the programs; and        •    reductions to Medicare payments CMS may impose for “excessive readmissions.”  Because of the many variables involved, we are unable to predict the net effect on the Company of the expected increases in insured individuals using our facilities, reductions in Medicare spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH funding, and numerous other provisions in the Health Reform Law that may affect the Company. Further, it is unclear how efforts to repeal or revise the Health Reform Law and remaining or new federal lawsuits challenging its constitutionality will be resolved or what the impact would be of any resulting changes to the law.
