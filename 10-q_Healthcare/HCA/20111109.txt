Item 1A: Risk Factors   Reference is made to the factors set forth under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q and other risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011, which are incorporated herein by reference. There have not been any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011, except as set forth below.  Changes in government health care programs may reduce our revenues.  A significant portion of our patient volume is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid. Specifically, we derived approximately 41% of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2010. Changes in government health care programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.    48    Table of Contents In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under the Medicare program. The recently enacted Budget Control Act of 2011 (“BCA”) provides for approximately $900 billion in deficit reduction, which would be achieved by applying caps to federal discretionary spending, but not including Medicare and Medicaid programs. However, the BCA also provides for new spending on program integrity initiatives intended to reduce fraud and abuse under the Medicare program. Further, the BCA requires the creation of a bipartisan joint congressional committee with a goal of identifying at least $1.5 trillion in additional deficit reductions over ten years, which is expected to consider entitlement program reforms including Medicare. If Congress does not enact deficit reductions greater than $1.2 trillion by January 15, 2012, the BCA requires automatic spending reductions of $1.2 trillion for federal fiscal years 2013 through 2021, minus any deficit reductions enacted by Congress and debt service costs. However, the percentage reduction for Medicare may not be more than 2% for a fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. We are unable to predict how these spending reductions will be structured. These reductions will be in addition to the Health Reform Law, which provides for material reductions in the growth of Medicare program spending, including reductions in Medicare market basket updates and Medicare disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) funding. Medicare payments in federal fiscal year 2011 for inpatient hospital services were slightly lower than payments for the same services in federal fiscal year 2010. CMS has issued a final rule that provides for an increase (approximately 1%) in Medicare payments for inpatient hospital services in federal fiscal year 2012 compared to federal fiscal year 2011. These adjustments to inpatient hospital payments do not take into account the impact of the BCA, but result from a combination of a market basket update reduction required by the Health Reform Law and the implementation of the Medicare severity diagnosis-related group (“MS-DRG”) system, which represents a refinement to the previous diagnosis related system. From time to time, CMS revises the reimbursement systems used to reimburse health care providers, which may include additional changes to the MS-DRG system and other payment systems. These changes may result in reduced Medicare payments.  Since most states must operate with balanced budgets and since the Medicaid program is often a state’s largest program, some states can be expected to enact or consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. The current economic environment has increased the budgetary pressures on many states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted, and likely will continue to result, in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs and the Children’s Health Insurance Program in many states. For example, in May 2011, the Florida legislature passed a budget agreement for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2011 that reduces Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals. As a result, we estimate that Florida Medicaid payments to our hospitals may be reduced by approximately $35 million during the second half of calendar year 2011 and by another approximately $35 million during the first half of calendar year 2012. Additionally, the Texas legislature passed a budget agreement effective September 1, 2011 that reduces Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals. As a result, we estimate that Texas Medicaid payments to our hospitals may be reduced by approximately $20 million in 2011 and by approximately $60 million in 2012. The Health Reform Law provides for material reductions to Medicaid DSH funding. Some states that provide Medicaid supplemental payments pursuant to UPL programs are reviewing these programs or have filed waiver requests with CMS to replace these programs, which could result in Medicaid supplemental payments being reduced or eliminated. Further, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. Effective March 23, 2010, the Health Reform Law requires states to at least maintain Medicaid eligibility standards established prior to the enactment of the law for adults until January 1, 2014 and for children until October 1, 2019. However, states with budget deficits may seek a waiver from this requirement to address eligibility standards that apply to adults making more than 133% of the federal poverty level. The Health Reform Law also provides for significant expansions to the Medicaid program, but these changes are not required until 2014. In addition, the Health Reform Law will result in increased state legislative and regulatory changes in order for states to comply with new federal mandates, such as the requirement to establish Exchanges, and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities.    49    Table of Contents In some cases, commercial third-party payers rely on all or portions of the MS-DRG system to determine payment rates, which may result in decreased reimbursement from some commercial third-party payers. Other changes to government health care programs may negatively impact payments from commercial third-party payers.  Current or future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts, changes in laws or regulations regarding government health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care programs and changes to commercial third-party payers in response to health care reform and other changes to government health care programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
