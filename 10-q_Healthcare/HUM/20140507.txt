Item 1A. Risk Factors  Except as set forth below, there have been no changes to the risk factors included in our 2013 Form 10-K:        •   The following replaces, in its entirety, the corresponding risk factor in our 2013 Form 10-K:  Our business may be materially adversely impacted by CMS’s adoption of the new coding set for diagnoses.  Federal regulations related to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA) contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets, and for the privacy and security of protected health information. ICD-9, the current system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the United States, was scheduled to be replaced by ICD-10 code sets on October 1, 2014. However, on April 1, 2014, The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 was signed into law, delaying implementation of ICD-10 until at least October 1, 2015. For dates of service on or after the date of final implementation, health plans and providers will be required to use ICD-10 codes for such diagnoses and procedures. While we have prepared for the transition to ICD-10, if unforeseen circumstances arise, it is possible that we could be exposed to investigations and allegations of noncompliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, if some providers continue to use ICD-9 codes on claims after the final implementation date, we will have to reject such claims, which may lead to claim resubmissions, increased call volume and provider and customer dissatisfaction. Further, providers may use ICD-10 codes differently than they used ICD-9 codes in the past, which could result in lost revenues under risk adjustment. During the transition to ICD-10, certain claims processing and payment information we have historically used to establish our reserves may not be reliable or available in a timely manner. If we do not adequately implement the new ICD-10 coding set, or if providers in our network do not adequately transition to the new ICD-10 coding set, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.    47    Table of Contents   Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
