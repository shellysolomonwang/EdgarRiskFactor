Item 1A. Risk FactorsExcept as set forth below, there have been no changes to the risk factors included in our 2014 Form 10-K: Risks Relating to the Proposed Merger with AetnaThe merger with Aetna is subject to various closing conditions, including governmental, regulatory and stockholder approvals as well as other uncertainties and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed.On July 2, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (which we refer to as the “Merger Agreement”), with Aetna Inc. (or “Aetna”), Echo Merger Sub, Inc. (or “Sub 1”) and Echo Merger Sub, LLC (or “Sub 2”), each a wholly owned subsidiary of Aetna. Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Sub 1 will merge with and into us (the “Merger”). In the Merger, each outstanding share of our common stock will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.8375 of a share of Aetna common stock and (ii) $125 in cash without interest, subject to any required withholding taxes. Immediately after the Merger, we (as the surviving corporation in the Merger) will be merged with and into Sub 2, with Sub 2 remaining as the surviving entity of that merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Aetna, to be renamed Humana LLC. The Merger is expected to close in the second half of 2016.Consummation of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, a number of which are not within our or Aetna’s control, and it is possible that such conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the Merger. These conditions include, among other things, (i) approval of the holders of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote on the Merger, (ii) approval of the holders of Aetna outstanding shares to the issuance of Aetna common stock in the Merger, (iii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of necessary approvals under state insurance and healthcare laws and regulations and pursuant to certain licenses of certain of Humana’s subsidiaries, (iv) the absence of legal restraints and prohibitions on the consummation of the Merger, (v) the effectiveness of the registration statement in respect of the Aetna common stock to be issued in the Merger, (vi) listing of the Aetna common stock to be issued in the Merger on the New York Stock Exchange, (vii) subject to the relevant standards set forth in the Merger Agreement, the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by each party, (viii) material compliance by each party with its covenants in the Merger Agreement, and (viii) no “Company Material Adverse Effect” with respect to us and no “Parent Material Adverse Effect” with respect to Aetna, in each case since the execution of and as defined in the Merger Agreement. In addition, Aetna’s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to (x) the condition that the required regulatory approvals do not impose any condition that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a “Regulatory Material Adverse Effect” (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), and (b) the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, has not imposed any sanctions with respect to our Medicare Advantage business that, individually or in the aggregate, is or would reasonably be expected to be material and adverse to us and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. We cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the required closing conditions will be satisfied or if another uncertainty may arise.If the Merger does not receive, or timely receive, the required regulatory approvals and clearances, or if any regulatory agencies impose certain conditions relating to the required regulatory approvals that would reasonably be expected to have a "Regulatory Material Adverse Effect", or if an event occurs that delays or prevents the Merger, such failure or delay to complete the Merger may cause uncertainty or other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and the price per share for our common stock.59Table of ContentsThe Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternative transactions to the proposed Merger.The Merger Agreement prohibits us from initiating, soliciting, knowingly encouraging, knowingly facilitating or entering into discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding alternative acquisition proposals. This prohibition limits our ability to affirmatively seek offers from other possible acquirers that may be superior to the pending Merger, although we are permitted, subject to compliance with certain procedures specified in the Merger Agreement, to respond to certain unsolicited proposals from third parties to allow our Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties. If we receive an unsolicited proposal from a third party that our Board of Directors determines is a superior proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), our Board of Directors may withdraw or otherwise change its recommendation of the Merger. However, we do not have the ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a superior proposal. If our Board of Directors withdraws or otherwise changes its recommendation of the Merger, or if we materially breach our obligation not to solicit alternative acquisition proposals, Aetna may terminate the Merger Agreement and we would be contractually obligated to pay a termination fee of $1.314 billion to Aetna. This termination fee may make it less likely that a third party will make an alternative acquisition proposal for us.The number of shares of Aetna common stock that our stockholders will receive in the Merger is based on a fixed exchange ratio. Because the market price of Aetna’s common stock will fluctuate, our stockholders cannot be certain of the value of the portion of the merger consideration to be paid in Aetna common stock.Upon completion of the Merger, each outstanding share of our common stock will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.8375 of a share of Aetna common stock and (ii) $125 in cash without interest, subject to any required withholding taxes. The exchange ratio for determining the number of shares of Aetna common stock that our stockholders will receive in the Merger is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of Aetna’s common stock, which will likely fluctuate before and after the completion of the Merger. Fluctuations in the value of Aetna’s common stock could result from changes in the business, operations or prospects of Aetna prior to or following the closing of the Merger, regulatory considerations, general market and economic conditions and other factors both within and beyond the control of us or Aetna. In addition, the Merger is expected to be completed a considerable amount of time after the date of our special meeting of stockholders to consider and vote on the Merger. As such, at the time of our special meeting of stockholders to consider and vote on the Merger, our stockholders will not have known the value of the Aetna share consideration that they will receive in the Merger for each of our common shares.While the Merger is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows or result in a loss of employees, customers, members or suppliers.The Merger Agreement includes restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion or termination of the Merger, generally requiring us to conduct our business in the ordinary course and subjecting us to a variety of specified limitations absent Aetna’s prior written consent. We may find that these and other contractual restrictions in the Merger Agreement may delay or prevent us from responding, or limit our ability to respond, effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future business opportunities that may arise during such period, even if our management believes they may be advisable. The pendency of the proposed Merger may also divert management’s attention and our resources from ongoing business and operations. Our employees, customers, members and suppliers may experience uncertainties about the effects of the Merger. In connection with the pending Merger, it is possible that some customers, members, suppliers and other parties with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with us as a result of the Merger. Similarly, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the Merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. If any of these effects were to occur, it could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and the price per share for our common stock. 60Table of ContentsIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to pay a termination fee to Aetna. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, in certain circumstances, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $1.314 billion to Aetna. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under such circumstances, the termination fee we may be required to pay under the Merger Agreement may require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes and other matters. Failure to consummate the Merger could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.If the Merger is not consummated, our ongoing businesses may be materially and adversely affected and, we will not have realized any of the potential benefits of having consummated the transaction, and we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:•matters relating to the proposed Merger (including integration planning) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us;•the Merger Agreement includes restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion or termination of the Merger, generally requiring us to conduct our business in the ordinary course and subjecting us to a variety of specified limitations absent Aetna's prior written consent. We may find that these and other contractual restrictions in the Merger Agreement may delay or prevent us from responding, or limit our ability to respond, effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future business opportunities that may arise during such period, even if our management believes they may be advisable. The pendency of the proposed Merger may also divert management’s attention and our resources from ongoing business and operations; •we may be required to pay a termination fee to Aetna and would have incurred expenses relating to the Merger; and•we also could be subject to litigation related to our failure to consummate the Merger or to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement.If the Merger is not consummated, these risks may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and the price per share for our common stock.Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
