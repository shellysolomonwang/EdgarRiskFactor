Item 1A. Risk Factors  Except as set forth below, there have been no changes to the risk factors included in our 2011 Form 10-K, as modified by the changes to those risk factors included in other reports we filed with the SEC subsequent to February 24, 2012:        •    The following replaces, in its entirety, the fifth bullet under the risk factor “As a government contractor, we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs” appearing in our 2011 Form 10-K:  CMS uses a risk-adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans according to health severity. The risk-adjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs. Under this model, rates paid to MA plans are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process that bases our prospective payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores, derived from medical diagnoses, to those enrolled in the government’s original Medicare program. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all MA plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician providers to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk-adjusted premium payment to MA plans. We generally rely on providers to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims.  CMS is continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected MA contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data. These audits are referred to herein as Risk-Adjustment Data Validation Audits, or RADV audits. RADV audits review medical record documentation in an attempt to validate provider coding practices and the presence of risk adjustment conditions which influence the calculation of premium payments to MA plans.  On February 24, 2012, CMS released a “Notice of Final Payment Error Calculation Methodology for Part C Medicare Advantage Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) Contract-Level Audits”. The final payment error calculation methodology provides that, in calculating the economic impact of audit results for an MA contract, if any, the results of the audit sample will be extrapolated to the entire MA contract based upon a comparison to “benchmark” audit data in the government fee-for-service program. This comparison to the government program benchmark audit is necessary to determine the economic impact, if any, of audit results because the government program experience provides the basis for MA plans’ risk adjustment to payment rates.  Additionally, the computation of a 99 percent confidence interval will be applied to the payment error estimate for the entire MA contract, which mitigates the potential for sampling error adversely impacting the extrapolated result for the entire contract.  The final methodology, including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements, will be applied to the next round of RADV contract level audits to be conducted on 2011 premium payments. MA contracts will be selected for audit after the close of the final reconciliation for the payment year being audited. The final reconciliation occurs in August of the calendar year following the payment year.    41    Table of Contents Estimated audit settlements, if any, are recorded as a reduction of premium revenue in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, based upon available information. However, we are awaiting additional guidance from CMS regarding the benchmark audit data in the government fee-for-service program and the identification of our specific MA contracts that will be selected for audit. Accordingly, we cannot determine whether such audits will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive, and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed description of these risks that may be found in our reports filed with the SEC from time to time, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K.
