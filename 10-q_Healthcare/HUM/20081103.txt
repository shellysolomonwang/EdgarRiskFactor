Item 1A. Risk Factors  Changes to the Risk Factors included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2008 are included below:        •    if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of benefits payable or future policy benefits payable based upon our estimates of future benefit claims are inadequate, our profitability could be materially adversely affected;        •    if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, our membership and profitability could be materially adversely affected;        •    if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, including our Medicare initiatives, our business could be materially adversely affected;        •    if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems, our business could be materially adversely affected;        •    we are involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages;        •    as a government contractor, we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs:  CMS has announced that it will perform audits of selected Medicare health plans each year to validate the provider coding practices under the risk adjustment model used to reimburse Medicare Advantage plans. These audits will involve a comprehensive review of medical records, and may result in contract level payment adjustments to premium payments made to a health plan pursuant to its Medicare contract with CMS. The first medical records audits will focus on risk adjustment data for 2006 that were used to determine 2007 payment amounts.  One Humana contract has been included in the pilot audit undertaken by CMS in 2008. Additional audits may occur. If necessary based on audit results, CMS may include contract level payment adjustments that may occur during 2008 or 2009 prior to Humana or other Medicare Advantage plans having the opportunity to appeal audit findings. We primarily rely on providers to appropriately document risk adjustment data in their medical records and appropriately code their claim submissions which we send to CMS as the basis for our risk adjustment model premium. We are working with CMS and our industry group to develop an orderly audit process. CMS has not yet indicated which additional contracts could be included, if any, or the complete details of the audit process. Therefore, we are unable to predict the number of our contracts that will be audited, the complete audit methodology to be used by CMS, or the outcome of these audits. However, an adjustment could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows;        •    our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform, could increase our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability:    40    Table of Contents The enactment of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, or the Act, in July 2008 could affect our Medicare operations. Principally, beginning in 2011 sponsors of Medicare Advantage PFFS plans will be required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks, except in geographic areas that CMS determines have fewer than two network-based Medicare Advantage plans. Additionally, the Act prohibits several different kinds of marketing activities by Medicare plan sponsors and their brokers beginning in 2009, and will phase out indirect medical education (IME) costs beginning in 2010. We are implementing various operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to answer the challenges presented by the Act. In addition, most of our PFFS enrollees reside in geographies where we have developed a PPO network and offer a PPO plan. We will continue to develop our PPO network and build network-based plan offerings to address the network restriction. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement those initiatives. Failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.        •    we are also subject to potential changes in the political environment that can affect public policy and can adversely affect the markets for our products;        •    any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper profitability;        •    any failure by us to manage acquisitions, and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects;        •    if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business could be adversely affected;        •    our recently implemented mail order pharmacy business subjects us to additional regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses;        •    our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted;        •    downgrades in our debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition;        •    changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations:  Recent events, including fallout from problems in the U.S. credit markets, indicate a potential near-term recession in the U.S. economy. The state of the U.S. economy could adversely affect our employer group and individual business, including Medicare, renewal prospects and our ability to collect or increase premiums. The state of the U.S. economy could also adversely affect the budget of individual states and of the federal government. That could result in attempts to reduce payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including the Medicare, military services, and Medicaid programs, and could result in an increase in taxes and assessments on our activities. Although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through, among other things, increases in premiums, there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.        •    The securities and credit markets recently have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption:  This volatility and disruption has impacted our investment portfolio. We evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. For the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses, the cost of investment securities is based upon specific identification. In analyzing individual securities for other-than-temporary impairments, we consider factors affecting the issuer, factors affecting the industry within which the issuer operates, and general debt and equity market trends. We also consider the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below its carrying value, the severity of the decline, the near-term prospects for recovery to cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized. During the third quarter of 2008, we realized losses of $108.3 million primarily     41    Table of Contents  associated with other-than-temporary impairments and realized losses associated with sales of distressed financial institution securities during September 2008. Gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2008 were $286.7 million, including $20.7 million related to our securities lending portfolio.  Given current market conditions, there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods.  We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements. However, continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions could significantly affect the availability of credit. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  Our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, both to the overall market and our industry, our credit ratings and debt capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us. If a combination of these factors were to occur, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms; and        •    increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business.  This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. A further list and description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our reports filed with the SEC from time to time, including our annual reports on Form 10-K. Any or all forward-looking statements we make may turn out to be wrong. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.    42    Table of Contents   Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
