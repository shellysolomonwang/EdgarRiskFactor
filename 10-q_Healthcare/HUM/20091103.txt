Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Government Segment  Our strategy and commitment to the Medicare programs has led to significant growth. Medicare Advantage membership increased to 1,514,800 members at September 30, 2009, up 146,800 members, or 10.7%, from 1,368,000 at September 30, 2008, primarily due to sales of preferred provider organization, or PPO products. This increase also included the impact of the October 31, 2008 Cariten acquisition, which added 46,900 Medicare HMO members. Likewise, Medicare Advantage premium revenues have increased 21.5% to $12.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 from $10.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2008. Recently the mix of sales has shifted increasingly to our network-based PPO offerings, which is particularly important given the enactment of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, or the Act, discussed more fully below. Medicare Advantage members enrolled in network-based products was approximately 62% at September 30, 2009 compared to 49% at September 30, 2008, with our PPO membership increasing 103.5% from September 30, 2008 to September 30, 2009.  Due to the enactment of the Act in July 2008, beginning in 2011, sponsors of Medicare Advantage Private Fee-For-Service, or PFFS, plans will be required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks, except in geographic areas that CMS determines have fewer than two network-based Medicare Advantage plans. We have 575,800 PFFS members, or approximately 38% of our total Medicare Advantage membership at September 30, 2009, down from 49% at December 31, 2008. Nearly 80% of these PFFS members at September 30, 2009 reside in geographies where we have developed a PPO network and offer a PPO plan. We are implementing various operational and strategic initiatives including further developing our PPO network and building network-based plan offerings to address the adequate network requirement.  Final 2010 Medicare Advantage rates were announced by CMS on April 6, 2009, with an effective rate decrease for the industry of 4% to 5%. Based on information available at the time we filed our 2010 bids in June 2009, we believe we have effectively designed Medicare Advantage products that address the lower rates while continuing to remain competitive compared to both the combination of original Medicare with a supplement policy as well as other Medicare Advantage competitors within our industry. In addition, we will continue to pursue our cost-reduction and outcome-enhancing strategies, including care coordination and disease management, to mitigate the adverse effects of this rate reduction on our Medicare Advantage members. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute operational and strategic initiatives with respect to changes in the Medicare Advantage program. Failure to execute these strategies may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  We also offer Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under the Medicare Part D program. These plans provide varying degrees of coverage. In order to offer these plans in a given year, in June of the preceding year we must submit bids to CMS    24    Table of Contents  for approval. During 2008, we experienced prescription drug claim expenses for our Medicare stand-alone PDPs that were higher than we had originally assumed in the bid that we submitted to CMS in June 2007. These higher claim levels for our Medicare stand-alone PDPs reflected a combination of several variances between our actuarial bid assumptions versus our experience. These variances resulted from, among other things, differences between the actuarial utilization assumptions (which are our attempts to predict members’ future utilization of drugs) in the bids for one of our plans versus our actual claims experience in 2008, as well as an increase in the percentage of higher cost members. These issues were addressed for 2009 based on enhancements made to our bid development and review processes. Our Medicare stand-alone PDP membership declined to 1,960,400 members at September 30, 2009, down 1,106,200 members from December 31, 2008 and down 1,128,600 members from September 30, 2008, resulting primarily from our competitive positioning as we realigned stand-alone PDP premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience. These actions also resulted in a substantial decline in our stand-alone PDP benefit ratio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008.  Our quarterly Government segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins annually on January 1 for renewals. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. As a result, the Government segment’s benefit ratio generally improves as the year progresses. In addition, the number of low-income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our stand-alone PDP products affect the quarterly benefit ratio pattern.  Our military services business primarily consists of the TRICARE South Region contract which covers benefits for healthcare services provided to beneficiaries through March 31, 2010. In July 2009, we were notified by the Department of Defense that we were not awarded the third generation TRICARE program contract for the South Region which had been subject to competing bids. We filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the DoD and those that appear to have been used by the DoD in making its contractor selection. On October 28, 2009, we learned that the GAO had upheld our protest. We anticipate the GAO will publicly release a detailed version of its protest decision expeditiously to include the grounds for the decision and the nature of relief recommended by the GAO to the DoD. At this time, we are not able to determine what actions the DoD will take in response to recommendations by the GAO, nor can we determine whether or not the protest decision by the GAO will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award, and therefore whether or not the protest decision is material. Based on discussions with the DoD, we expect the government to exercise option period seven, which would extend the current contract through September 30, 2010. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, premiums and ASO fees associated with the TRICARE South Region contract were $2.6 billion, or 11.3% of our total premiums and ASO fees. We are continuing to evaluate issues associated with our military services businesses such as potential impairment of certain assets primarily consisting of goodwill, which had a carrying value of $49.8 million at September 30, 2009, potential exit costs, possible asset sales, and a strategic assessment of ancillary businesses. Goodwill was not impaired at September 30, 2009.  Commercial Segment  Commercial segment pretax earnings, impacted by the economic recession and the highly competitive environment partially offset by higher investment income, decreased by $56.1 million, or 26.2%, for the 2009 period compared to the 2008 period. Commercial segment medical membership at September 30, 2009 of 3,426,900 decreased 127,100 members, or 3.6%, from September 30, 2008, despite the acquisition of Cariten in the fourth quarter of 2008 which added approximately 49,700 fully-insured members and 21,600 ASO members, as discussed more fully below. Commercial segment medical membership decreased 193,900 members, or 5.4% from December 31, 2008 to September 30, 2009. The decline in membership primarily was a result of the impact of the economic recession as well as the loss of two larger ASO accounts. The economic recession has led to increased in-group member attrition as employers    25    Table of Contents  reduce their workforce levels primarily through reductions in force of less experienced workers. As a result, we are also experiencing higher utilization of benefits, mainly in our fully-insured group accounts, primarily due to the shift in the mix of members to an older workforce having more health care needs, as well as members utilizing more benefits ahead of actual or perceived layoffs, members seeking to maximize their benefits once their deductibles are met, and increased COBRA participation. The membership declines were partially offset by enrollment gains in our individual product, a strategic area of commercial growth. Individual membership at September 30, 2009 increased 13.3% from September 30, 2008 and 10.4% from December 31, 2008. This increase in individual membership, together with administrative costs associated with increased business for our mail-order pharmacy, led to a higher Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio. We expect Commercial segment medical membership to decline by approximately 200,000 members for the full-year 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008, reflecting the impact of in-group member attrition due to workforce reductions as well as the loss of two larger ASO accounts.  Financial Position  At September 30, 2009, cash, cash equivalents and our investment securities totaled $8.7 billion, or 61.1% of total assets, with 16.7% of the $8.7 billion invested in cash and cash equivalents. Investment securities consist primarily of debt securities of investment-grade quality with an average credit rating by S&P of AA+ at September 30, 2009 and an average duration of approximately 4.1 years. Including cash and cash equivalents, the average duration of our investment portfolio was approximately 3.6 years. We had $5.5 million of mortgage-backed securities associated with Alt-A or subprime loans at September 30, 2009 and no collateralized debt obligations.  Gross unrealized losses were $68.9 million at September 30, 2009 compared to $313.0 million at December 31, 2008. Gross unrealized gains were $223.2 million at September 30, 2009 compared to $83.2 million at December 31, 2008. All issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments. We believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased. As of September 30, 2009, we do not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized costs basis, and as a result, we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2009.  During the third quarter of 2008, we realized losses of $108.3 million ($68.7 million after tax, or $0.40 per diluted common share) primarily associated with other-than-temporary impairments in our investment portfolios as well as realized losses associated with sales of distressed financial institution securities during September 2008. Of the $108.3 million, $51.9 million was allocated to the Government segment and $56.4 million was allocated to the Commercial segment. There were no material other-than-temporary impairments in the three or nine months ended September 30, 2009.  We continuously review our investment portfolios. There is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other-than- temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods.  In addition, in the fall of 2008 we terminated all fixed to variable interest-rate swap agreements outstanding associated with our senior notes based on recent changes in the credit market environment. In exchange for terminating these interest-rate swap agreements, we received cash of $93.0 million representing the fair value of the swap assets. This transaction also fixed the interest rate on our senior notes to a weighted-average rate of 6.08%. We may re-enter into swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors.  We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future, as well as to refinance or repay debt. Our long-term debt, consisting primarily of senior notes, of $1,680.4 million represented 23.2% of total capitalization at September 30, 2009, declining from 30.3% at December 31, 2008. The earliest maturity of our senior notes is in June 2016. We have available a 5-year, $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which expires in July 2011. As of September 30, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement.    26    Table of Contents Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., the parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, our subsidiaries paid dividends of $774.1 million to the parent compared to $296.0 million for the full year 2008. In addition, the parent made capital contributions to our subsidiaries of $104.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 compared to $242.8 million for the full year 2008. Exclusive of any future acquisitions, we do not anticipate significant additional funding of the subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of 2009.  Recent Acquisitions  On October 31, 2008 we acquired PHP Companies, Inc. (d/b/a Cariten Healthcare), or Cariten, for cash consideration of approximately $256.1 million. The Cariten acquisition increased our presence in eastern Tennessee, adding approximately 49,700 commercial fully-insured members, 21,600 commercial ASO members, and 46,900 Medicare HMO members. This acquisition also added approximately 85,700 Medicaid ASO members under a contract which expired on December 31, 2008 and was not renewed.  On August 29, 2008, we acquired Metcare Health Plans, Inc., or Metcare, for cash consideration of approximately $14.9 million. The acquisition expanded our Medicare HMO membership in central Florida, adding approximately 7,300 members.  On May 22, 2008, we acquired OSF Health Plans, Inc., or OSF, a managed care company serving both Medicare and commercial members in central Illinois, for cash consideration of approximately $87.3 million. This acquisition expanded our presence in Illinois, broadening our ability to serve multi-location employers with a wider range of products, including our specialty offerings. The acquisition added approximately 33,400 commercial fully-insured members, 29,700 commercial ASO members, and 14,000 Medicare HMO and PPO members.  On April 30, 2008, we acquired UnitedHealth Group’s Las Vegas, Nevada individual SecureHorizons Medicare Advantage HMO business, or SecureHorizons, for cash consideration of approximately $185.3 million, plus subsidiary capital and surplus requirements of $40 million. The acquisition expanded our presence in the Las Vegas market, adding approximately 26,700 Medicare HMO members.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  Financial Instruments  In April 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued new guidance to address concerns about (1) measuring the fair value of financial instruments when the markets become inactive and quoted prices may reflect distressed transactions and (2) recording impairment charges on investments in debt securities. The FASB also issued guidance to require disclosures of fair values of certain financial instruments in interim financial statements to provide financial statement users with more timely information about the effects of current market conditions on their financial instruments. The new guidance highlights and expands on the factors that should be considered in estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for a financial asset or liability has significantly decreased and requires new disclosures relating to fair value measurement inputs and valuation techniques (including changes in inputs and valuation techniques). In addition, new guidance regarding recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments changed (1) the trigger for determining whether an other-than-temporary impairment exists and (2) the amount of an impairment charge to be recorded in earnings. We adopted the provisions of the new guidance for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Refer to Note 4, Note 5 and Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for disclosures related to the implementation of the new guidance.  Subsequent Events  In May 2009, the FASB issued new guidance establishing general standards of accounting for disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued, or subsequent events. The standard is based on the same principles that currently exist in the auditing standards. We are required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated and for certain nonrecognized subsequent events, the nature of the event and an estimate of its    27    Table of Contents  financial effect or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. We adopted the new provisions for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for the related disclosures.  Codification  In June 2009, the FASB codified existing accounting standards. The FASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM (ASC) is the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB and supersedes all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All ASC content carries the same level of authority and anything outside of the ASC is nonauthoritative. We adopted the new guidance for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, which changed the way we reference accounting standards in our disclosures.  Fair Value of Liabilities  In August 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on measuring liabilities at fair value. The new guidance reaffirms that the fair value measurement of a liability assumes the transfer of a liability to a market participant as of the measurement date, whereby the liability to the counterparty is not settled but rather continues, and provides additional guidance on how to estimate the fair value of a liability in a hypothetical transaction assuming the transfer of a liability to a third party. The new provisions are effective for us beginning with the filing of our Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of these new provisions to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.    28    Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2009 and 2008  The following discussion primarily deals with our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2009, or the 2009 quarter, the three months ended September 30, 2008, or the 2008 quarter, the nine months ended September 30, 2009, or the 2009 period, and the nine months ended September 30, 2008, or the 2008 period.

These tables of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion that follows. We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes.  Summary  Net income was $301.5 million, or $1.78 per diluted common share, in the 2009 quarter compared to $183.0 million, or $1.09 per diluted common share, in the 2008 quarter. Net income was $789.0 million, or $4.67 per diluted common share, in the 2009 period compared to $473.1 million, or $2.79 per diluted common share, in the 2008 period. The 2008 quarter and period’s net income included realized losses of $68.7 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share, primarily associated with other-than-temporary impairments in our investment and securities lending portfolios, as well as realized losses primarily associated with sales of distressed financial institution securities during September 2008. Excluding these realized losses, the increase in earnings resulted primarily from lower Medicare stand-alone PDP claim expenses in 2009, contributing to improved operating performance in the Government segment.  Premium Revenues and Medical Membership  Premium revenues increased 6.5% to $7.4 billion for the 2009 quarter, compared to $7.0 billion for the 2008 quarter. For the 2009 period, premium revenues were $22.6 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 8.4%, compared to $20.8 billion for the 2008 period. These increases primarily are a result of higher premium revenues in the Government segment. Premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums. Items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership.    31    Table of Contents Government segment premium revenues increased $0.5 billion, or 9.0%, to $5.7 billion for the 2009 quarter, compared to $5.2 billion for the 2008 quarter. For the 2009 period, Government segment premium revenues were $17.2 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 10.8%, compared to $15.5 billion for the 2008 period. These increases primarily were attributable to higher average Medicare Advantage membership and an increase in per member premiums, partially offset by a decrease in our Medicare stand-alone PDP membership. Average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period. Average Medicare Advantage membership increased 11% for the 2009 quarter and 13% for the 2009 period compared to the 2008 quarter and period, respectively. Sales of our PPO products drove the majority of the 146,800 increase in Medicare Advantage members since September 30, 2008. This increase also included the impact of the October 31, 2008 Cariten acquisition, which added 46,900 Medicare HMO members. Medicare Advantage per member premiums increased 6.3% during the 2009 quarter and 7.2% during the 2009 period compared to the 2008 quarter and period, respectively. These per member premium increases in the 2009 quarter and period include the effect of introducing member premiums for most of our Medicare Advantage products. Medicare stand-alone PDP premium revenues decreased $0.2 billion, or 26.1%, during the 2009 quarter compared to the 2008 quarter and $0.8 billion, or 29.3%, during the 2009 period compared to the 2008 period. These decreases primarily were due to a 1,128,600, or 36.5%, decrease in PDP membership since September 30, 2008, primarily resulting from our competitive positioning as we realigned stand-alone PDP premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience.  Commercial segment premium revenues decreased $15.8 million, or 0.9%, from the 2008 quarter to $1,771.8 million for the 2009 quarter, primarily due to a 3.7% decline in average fully-insured medical membership, partially offset by a 4.9% increase in fully-insured group per member premiums. For the 2009 period, Commercial segment premium revenues increased $68.8 million, or 1.3%, to $5,332.8 million compared to $5,264.0 million for the 2008 period. The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of OSF and Cariten in the second and fourth quarters of 2008, respectively, and an increase in per member premiums, partially offset by a decline in fully-insured membership. Per member premiums for fully-insured group accounts increased 4.9% during the 2009 quarter and 5.0% during the 2009 period compared to the 2008 quarter and period, respectively. Fully-insured membership decreased 3.7%, or 70,500 members, to 1,860,700 at September 30, 2009 compared to 1,931,200 at September 30, 2008. Excluding the 49,700 fully-insured members added with the acquisition of Cariten, the membership decrease of 120,200 primarily was due to the impact of the economic recession which has led to increased in-group member attrition as employers reduce their workforce levels primarily through reductions in force.  Administrative Services Fees  Our administrative services fees were $133.7 million for the 2009 quarter, an increase of $19.3 million, or 16.9%, from $114.4 million for the 2008 quarter. For the 2009 period, administrative services fees were $368.3 million, an increase of $29.0 million, or 8.5%, from $339.3 million for the 2008 period. The increases in administrative services fees primarily were due to an increase in per member fees, the recognition of previously deferred revenues associated with Green Ribbon Health, and the acquisition of Cariten in the fourth quarter of 2008, partially offset by a decline in Commercial ASO membership, primarily isolated to the loss of two larger ASO accounts. During the 2009 quarter, we received final outcome data from CMS related to Green Ribbon Health, a disease management demonstration project with CMS, and accordingly recognized previously deferred revenue of approximately $12 million in the 2009 quarter.  Investment Income  Investment income totaled $74.9 million for the 2009 quarter, an increase of $91.7 million from a $16.8 million loss for the 2008 quarter. For the 2009 period, investment income totaled $219.7 million, an increase of $65.7 million from $154.0 million for the 2008 period. The 2008 quarter and period reflect realized losses of $108.3 million recorded during the 2008 quarter primarily associated with other-than-temporary impairments in our investment and securities lending portfolios, as well as realized losses associated with sales of distressed financial institution securities. Of the $108.3 million, $51.9 million was allocated to the Government segment and $56.4 million was allocated to the Commercial segment. Excluding these realized losses, investment income decreased primarily due to the lower interest rate environment.    32    Table of Contents Other Revenue  Other revenue totaled $64.1 million for the 2009 quarter, an increase of $5.1 million from $59.0 million for the 2008 quarter. Other revenue totaled $181.4 million for the 2009 period, an increase of $26.9 million from $154.5 million for the 2008 period. The increases primarily were attributable to increased revenue from growth related to RightSourceRxSM, our mail-order pharmacy.  Benefit Expense  Consolidated benefit expense was $6.1 billion for the 2009 quarter, an increase of $0.3 billion, or 5.2%, from $5.8 billion for the 2008 quarter. For the 2009 period, consolidated benefit expense was $18.7 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 6.1%, from $17.7 billion for the 2008 period. The increases were primarily driven by an increase in Government segment benefit expense, as described below.  The consolidated benefit ratio for the 2009 quarter was 82.1%, a 100 basis points decrease from 83.1% for the 2008 quarter primarily due to a decrease in the Government segment benefit ratio partially offset by an increase in the Commercial segment benefit ratio. For the 2009 period, the consolidated benefit ratio was 83.1%, a 180 basis points decrease from 84.9% for the 2008 period. The decrease primarily was attributable to a decrease in the Government segment benefit ratio as described below.  The Government segment’s benefit expenses increased $0.3 billion, or 6.1%, in the 2009 quarter compared to the 2008 quarter. For the 2009 period, the Government segment’s benefit expenses increased $1.0 billion, or 7.6%, from the 2008 period. The increases primarily were due to an increase in the average number of Medicare Advantage members and the impact from the acquisitions of Cariten, Metcare, OSF, and SecureHorizons. The Government segment’s benefit ratio for the 2009 quarter was 81.9%, a 220 basis point decrease from the 2008 quarter of 84.1%, primarily driven by a 340 basis point decline in the Medicare benefit ratio. Likewise, for the 2009 period, the Government segment’s benefit ratio was 84.3%, a 250 basis point decrease from the 2008 period of 86.8%, primarily driven by a 330 basis point decline in the Medicare benefit ratio. The decline in the Medicare benefit ratio primarily resulted from a substantial decline in the Medicare stand-alone PDP benefit ratio as a result of our competitive positioning as we realigned stand-alone PDP premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience.  The Commercial segment’s benefit expenses increased $32.3 million, or 2.3%, from the 2008 quarter to the 2009 quarter primarily as a result of the acquisition of Cariten in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the 2009 period, the Commercial segment’s benefit expenses increased $55.8 million, or 1.3%, from the 2008 period. The increase primarily resulted from the OSF and Cariten acquisitions in the second and fourth quarters of 2008, respectively. The benefit ratio for the Commercial segment of 82.7% for the 2009 quarter increased 250 basis points from the 2008 quarter’s benefit ratio of 80.2%. For the 2009 period, the Commercial segment’s benefit ratio of 79.4% was unchanged from the 2008 period’s benefit ratio. The increase from the 2008 quarter to the 2009 quarter primarily reflected higher utilization associated with the general economy and the highly competitive environment, as well as the impact of the H1N1 virus, partially offset by an increase in per member premiums. We are experiencing higher utilization of benefits in our fully-insured group accounts as in-group attrition, primarily as a result of reductions in force of less experienced workers, has led to a shift in the mix of members to an older workforce having more health care needs, as well as members utilizing more benefits ahead of actual or perceived layoffs, members seeking to maximize their benefits once their deductibles are met, and increased COBRA participation.  SG&A Expense  Consolidated SG&A expenses increased $68.6 million, or 7.0%, during the 2009 quarter compared to the 2008 quarter. For the 2009 period, consolidated SG&A expenses increased $270.2 million, or 9.5%, from the 2008 period. The increases primarily resulted from an increase in the number of employees due to the Medicare growth and higher average individual product membership. The number of employees increased by 700, or 2.5%, to 28,500 at September 30, 2009 from 27,800 at September 30, 2008.  The consolidated SG&A expense ratio for the 2009 quarter of 13.7% was unchanged from the 2008 quarter. For the 2009 period, the consolidated SG&A expense ratio was 13.5% compared to 13.4% for the 2008 period. The increase primarily was due to increases in the Commercial segment SG&A expense ratios as discussed below.    33    Table of Contents Our Government and Commercial segments incur both direct and shared indirect overhead SG&A expenses. We allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent.  SG&A expenses in the Government segment increased $50.9 million, or 9.6%, during the 2009 quarter compared to the 2008 quarter. For the 2009 period, SG&A expenses of $1,731.6 million increased $153.6 million, or 9.7%, from the 2008 period. The Government segment SG&A expense ratio for the 2009 quarter of 10.2% was unchanged from the 2008 quarter. For the 2009 period, the Government segment SG&A expense ratio of 10.0% decreased 10 basis points from 10.1% for the 2008 period. The decrease primarily resulted from efficiency gains associated with servicing higher average Medicare Advantage membership. For example, we transitioned the recently acquired OSF and Metcare members into our primary Medicare service platform and eliminated the cost of having duplicate platforms.  Commercial segment SG&A expenses increased $17.6 million, or 3.9%, during the 2009 quarter compared to the 2008 quarter. Commercial segment SG&A expenses increased $116.6 million, or 9.2%, during the 2009 period compared to the 2008 period. The Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio increased 100 basis points from 23.0% for the 2008 quarter to 24.0% for the 2009 quarter. For the 2009 period, the Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio of 23.9% increased 160 basis points from 22.3% for the 2008 period. The increases primarily were due to administrative costs associated with increased business for our mail-order pharmacy and higher average individual product membership. Average individual product membership increased 14.1% during the 2009 quarter compared to the 2008 quarter and 19.4% during the 2009 period compared to the 2008 period. Individual accounts bear a higher SG&A expense ratio due to higher distribution costs as compared to larger accounts.  Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and amortization for the 2009 quarter totaled $62.1 million compared to $56.1 million for the 2008 quarter, an increase of $6.0 million, or 10.6%. Depreciation and amortization for the 2009 period totaled $180.6 million compared to $160.5 million for the 2008 period, an increase of $20.1 million, or 12.5%. These increases reflected capital expenditures since September 30, 2008.  Interest Expense  Interest expense was $26.3 million for the 2009 quarter compared to $19.3 million for the 2008 quarter, an increase of $7.0 million. Interest expense was $79.6 million for the 2009 period compared to $53.6 million for the 2008 period, an increase of $26.0 million. The increases primarily were due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt. In the second quarter of 2008, we issued $500 million of 7.20% senior notes due June 15, 2018 and $250 million of 8.15% senior notes due June 15, 2038, the proceeds of which were used for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement. The weighted average effective interest rate for all of our long-term debt was 6.25% and 4.84% for the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and 5.91% and 4.60% for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Income Taxes  Our effective tax rate during the 2009 quarter of 35.8% compared to the effective tax rate of 35.3% for the 2008 quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2009 period of 34.4% was lower than the 2008 period of 35.4%. The decrease in the 2009 period primarily was due to the reduction of the $16.8 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the first quarter of 2009 as a result of audit settlements.    34    Table of Contents Membership  The following table presents our medical and specialty membership at September 30, 2009, June 30, 2009, March 31, 2009, and at the end of each quarter in 2008:                          2009   2008      Sept. 30   June 30   March 31   Dec. 31   Sept. 30   June 30   March 31   Medical Membership:                        Government segment:                        Medicare Advantage   1,514,800   1,499,800   1,468,900   1,435,900   1,368,000   1,345,000   1,267,700   Medicare stand-alone PDP   1,960,400   1,992,000   2,078,900   3,066,600   3,089,000   3,105,200   3,150,200                                 Total Medicare   3,475,200   3,491,800   3,547,800   4,502,500   4,457,000   4,450,200   4,417,900                                 Military services   1,754,300   1,753,400   1,746,600   1,736,400   1,734,400   1,737,600   1,728,100   Military services ASO   1,260,800   1,254,900   1,244,000   1,228,300   1,219,500   1,206,200   1,193,000                                 Total military services   3,015,100   3,008,300   2,990,600   2,964,700   2,953,900   2,943,800   2,921,100                                 Medicaid   399,800   393,600   385,200   385,400   385,100   387,700   384,200   Medicaid ASO   —    —    —    85,700   177,300   173,800   175,400                                 Total Medicaid   399,800   393,600   385,200   471,100   562,400   561,500   559,600                                 Total Government   6,890,100   6,893,700   6,923,600   7,938,300   7,973,300   7,955,500   7,898,600                                 Commercial segment:                        Fully-insured   1,860,700   1,871,700   1,893,700   1,978,800   1,931,200   1,936,600   1,861,000   ASO   1,566,200   1,576,200   1,577,800   1,642,000   1,622,800   1,621,900   1,597,700                                          Total Commercial   3,426,900   3,447,900   3,471,500   3,620,800   3,554,000   3,558,500   3,458,700                                          Total medical members   10,317,000   10,341,600   10,395,100   11,559,100   11,527,300   11,514,000   11,357,300                                          Specialty Membership:                        Commercial segment   7,262,900   6,790,400   6,743,700   6,817,000   6,727,400   6,744,400   6,916,200                                    (a) The Commercial segment provides a full range of insured specialty products including dental, vision, and other supplemental products. Members included in these products may not be unique to each product since members have the ability to enroll in multiple products.  Liquidity  Our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums, ASO fees, and investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings. Our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments, SG&A expenses, interest on borrowings, taxes, purchases of investment securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and repayments on borrowings. Because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months, our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment. Conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment. The use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital.  Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $1,452.0 million at September 30, 2009 from $1,970.4 million at December 31, 2008. The change in cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 is summarized as follows:                    2009     2008        (in thousands)     Net cash provided by operating activities   $ 1,147,491     $ 685,737     Net cash used in investing activities     (1,470,198 )      (192,312 )    Net cash used in financing activities     (195,710 )      (990,978 )                          Decrease in cash and cash equivalents   $ (518,417 )    $ (497,553 )                       35    Table of Contents Cash Flow from Operating Activities  The increase in operating cash flows for the 2009 period compared to the 2008 period primarily resulted from increased earnings associated with lower stand-alone PDP claims. Comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital. The most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and ASO fees and payments of benefit expenses. We illustrate these changes with the following summaries of receivables and benefits payable.  The detail of total net receivables was as follows at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008:                            September 30,2009     December 31,2008     2009 PeriodChange     2008 PeriodChange        (in thousands)     Military services:                       Base receivable   $ 480,092     $ 436,009     $ 44,083     $ 69,008     Change orders     814       6,190       (5,376 )      1,018                                       Military services subtotal     480,906       442,199       38,707       70,026           Medicare     159,908       232,608       (72,700 )      (25,571 )    Commercial and other     183,785       164,035       19,750       45,291     Allowance for doubtful accounts     (48,071 )      (49,160 )      1,089       14,366                                       Total net receivables   $ 776,528     $ 789,682       (13,154 )      104,112                                 Reconciliation to cash flow statement:                       Receivables from acquisition               6,907       (10,792 )                                Change in receivables per cash flow statement             $ (6,247 )    $ 93,320                                Medicare receivables decreased $72.7 million from December 31, 2008 to September 30, 2009 compared to a decrease of $25.6 million from December 31, 2007 to September 30, 2008. Medicare receivables are impacted by the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the CMS risk-adjustment model.  Military services base receivables consist of estimated claims owed from the federal government for health care services provided to beneficiaries and underwriting fees. The claim reimbursement component of military services base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period. The timing of claim reimbursements resulted in the $44.1 million and $69.0 million increase in base receivables for the 2009 and 2008 periods, respectively.  The detail of benefits payable was as follows at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008:                          September 30,2009   December 31,2008   2009 PeriodChange     2008 PeriodChange        (in thousands)     IBNR (1)   $ 2,038,505   $ 1,851,047   $ 187,458     $ 236,401     Military services benefits payable (2)     310,873     306,797     4,076       14,361     Reported claims in process (3)     380,924     486,514     (105,590 )      411     Other benefits payable (4)     635,179     561,221     73,958       120,581                                   Total benefits payable   $ 3,365,481   $ 3,205,579   $ 159,902     $ 371,754                                   Reconciliation to cash flow statement:                     Benefits payable from acquisition             —        (34,122 )                              Change in benefits payable per cash flow statement           $ 159,902     $ 337,632                                  (1) IBNR represents an estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date. The level of IBNR is primarily impacted by membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower IBNR).    36    Table of Contents   (2) Military services benefits payable primarily results from the timing of the cost of providing health care services to beneficiaries and the payment to the provider. A corresponding receivable for reimbursement by the federal government is included in the base receivable in the previous receivables table.    (3) Reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling, as well as amounts owed to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff.    (4) Other benefits payable include amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements.  The increase in benefits payable from December 31, 2008 to September 30, 2009 primarily was due to an increase in IBNR as well as an increase in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements, both as a result of Medicare Advantage membership growth, partially offset by a decrease in the amount of processed but unpaid claims, including pharmacy claims, which fluctuate due to month-end cutoff.  Cash Flow from Investing Activities  We reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities, primarily fixed income securities, totaling $1,584.6 million in the 2009 period and $551.9 million in the 2008 period. Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing, billing and collections, medical utilization review, and customer service. Total capital expenditures were $122.1 million in the 2009 period compared to $179.5 million in the 2008 period. We expect total capital expenditures for the full year 2009 of approximately $175 million compared to $262 million for the full year 2008. The full year 2008 included expenditures associated with constructing a new data center building and mail-order pharmacy warehouse.  Cash Flow from Financing Activities  Net borrowings under our credit agreement decreased $250.0 million in the 2009 period primarily from the repayment of amounts borrowed to fund the acquisition of Cariten.  In June 2008, we issued $500 million of 7.20% senior notes due June 15, 2018 and $250 million of 8.15% senior notes due June 15, 2038. Our net proceeds, reduced for the original issue discount and cost of the offering, were $742.6 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement.  Receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were $330.1 million higher than claims payments during the 2009 period and $33.6 million less than claims payments during the 2008 period.  During the 2008 period, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million common shares for $92.8 million under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors that was then in effect. No repurchases of common shares were made during the 2009 period under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors in the third quarter of 2008.  The remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in the 2009 and 2008 periods primarily resulted from the change in the securities lending payable, proceeds from stock option exercises, and the excess tax benefit from stock compensation.  Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity  Stock Repurchase Plan  In the third quarter of 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans. The shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, by block purchases, or in privately-negotiated transactions, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. Due to volatility in the financial markets, we have not yet repurchased any shares under the third quarter 2008 authorization. The share repurchase program expires on December 31, 2009.    37    Table of Contents Senior Notes  We previously issued $500 million of 6.45% senior notes due June 1, 2016, $500 million of 7.20% senior notes due June 15, 2018, $300 million of 6.30% senior notes due August 1, 2018, and $250 million of 8.15% senior notes due June 15, 2038. The 7.20% and 8.15% senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded (or subsequently upgraded) and contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances. All four series of our senior notes, which are unsecured, may be redeemed at our option at any time at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest and a specified make-whole amount. Concurrent with the senior notes issuances, we entered into interest-rate swap agreements to exchange the fixed interest rate under these senior notes for a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. In the fall of 2008 we terminated all of our swap agreements. We may re-enter into swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors.  Credit Agreement  Our 5-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement expires in July 2011. Under the credit agreement, at our option, we can borrow on either a revolving credit basis or a competitive advance basis. The revolving credit portion bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The spread, currently 50 basis points, varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from 27 to 80 basis points. We also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently 12.5 basis points, may fluctuate between 8 and 20 basis points, depending upon our credit ratings. In addition, a utilization fee of 10 basis points is payable for each day in which borrowings under the facility exceed 50% of the total $1.0 billion commitment. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based on LIBOR, at our option.  The terms of the credit agreement include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse event clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth and a maximum leverage ratio. We are in compliance with the financial covenants.  At September 30, 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement. We have outstanding letters of credit of $3.5 million secured under the credit agreement. No amounts have been drawn on these letters of credit. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2009, we had $996.5 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement, none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement. We have other customary, arms-length relationships, including financial advisory and banking, with some parties to the credit agreement.  Other Long-Term Borrowings  Other long-term borrowings of $37.7 million at September 30, 2009 represent junior subordinated debt assumed in the 2007 KMG acquisition of $36.1 million and financing for the renovation of a building of $1.6 million. The junior subordinated debt, which is due in 2037, may be called by us in 2012 and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 8.02% payable quarterly until 2012, and then payable at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus 310 basis points. The debt associated with the building renovation bears interest at 2.00%, is collateralized by the building, and is payable in various installments through 2014.  Liquidity Requirements  We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future, and to refinance or repay debt.    38    Table of Contents Adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Our investment-grade credit rating at September 30, 2009 was BBB- according to Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, or S&P, and Baa3 according to Moody’s Investors Services, Inc., or Moody’s. A downgrade by S&P to BB+ or by Moody’s to Ba1 would trigger an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to $750 million of our senior notes. Successive one notch downgrades would increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points, or interest expense by $1.9 million, up to a maximum 100 basis points.  In addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. The parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. We continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. During the 2009 period, our subsidiaries paid dividends of $774.1 million to the parent compared to $296.0 million for the full year 2008. In addition, the parent made capital contributions to our subsidiaries of $104.3 million during the 2009 period compared to $242.8 million for the full year 2008. Exclusive of any future acquisitions, we do not anticipate significant additional funding of the subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of 2009.  Regulatory Requirements  Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., the parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required.  Although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Based on the most recently filed statutory financial statements as of June 30, 2009, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $3.2 billion in our state regulated subsidiaries, $0.9 billion above the aggregate $2.3 billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states.    39    Table of Contents   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk  Our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk, including those resulting from changes in interest rates.  The level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense. Until October 7, 2008, we exchanged the fixed interest rate under all of our senior notes for a variable interest rate based on LIBOR using interest rate swap agreements. As a result, changes in interest rates generally resulted in an increase or decrease to investment income partially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase to interest expense, partially hedging our exposure to interest rate risk. However, due to extreme volatility in the securities and credit markets, LIBOR increased while the interest rate we would earn on invested assets like cash and cash equivalents decreased. As a result, we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements, fixing the average interest rate under our senior notes at 6.08%. In exchange for terminating our rights under the interest rate swap agreements, we received $93.0 million in cash from the counterparties representing the fair value of the swap assets. We may re-enter into interest rate swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors.  Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio, consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investment-grade quality with an average S&P credit rating of AA+ at September 30, 2009. Our net unrealized position improved $384.2 million from a net unrealized loss position of $229.9 million at December 31, 2008 to a net unrealized gain position of $154.3 million at September 30, 2009. As of September 30, 2009, we had gross unrealized losses of $68.9 million on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased, and as such, there were no material other-than-temporary impairments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009. While we believe that these impairments are temporary and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities, given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods.  Duration is the time-weighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow. Duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates, providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates. However, actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration. The average duration of our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was approximately 3.6 years as of September 30, 2009. Based on the duration including cash equivalents, a 1% increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately $305 million.      Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, our Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, and our Principal Accounting Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures for the quarter ended September 30, 2009.  Based on our evaluation, our CEO, CFO and Principal Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information the Company is required to disclose in its reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, including, without limitation, ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.    40    Table of Contents Part II. Other Information      Item 1: Legal Proceedings  For a description of the litigation and legal proceedings pending against us, see “Legal Proceedings” in Note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.      Item 1A. Risk Factors  The following list summarizes the risk factors described more fully in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, as filed with the SEC on February 20, 2009, as supplemented by the information contained under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed after the date of such Annual Report. The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the Risk Factors and information disclosed in such Annual Report and subsequent Quarterly and Current Reports filed with the SEC:        •    If we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of benefits payable or future policy benefits payable based upon our estimates of future benefit claims are inadequate, our profitability could be materially adversely affected. We estimate the costs of our benefit expense payments, and design and price our products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. These estimates, however, involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is extremely sensitive to payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends.        •    If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, including our Medicare initiatives, our business could be materially adversely affected.        •    If we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems, our business could be materially adversely affected.        •    We are involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business.        •    Our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and could materially affect our business, profitability and financial condition. In addition, as a government contractor, we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs.  The President of the United States and members of the U.S. Congress have proposed significant reforms to the U.S. health care system. Both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives have conducted hearings about U.S. health insurance reform. The President’s fiscal year 2010 budget included proposals to limit Medicare payments, reduce prescription drug spending and impose new taxes on health insurers. In addition, certain members of Congress have proposed a single-payer health care system, a government health insurance option to compete with private plans and other expanded public health care measures. Most recently, in September 2009, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee released a draft of the committee’s health insurance reform bill, a bill which included an excise tax on all private insurance companies, requiring the industry to contribute $6.7 billion to health care reform each year for a period of 10 years. Various health insurance reform proposals have also emerged at the state level.    41    Table of Contents In October, 2009, CMS proposed revisions to the administration of both the Medicare Advantage Program (Part C) and the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program which could change the way we operate, increase our cost of doing business and/or adversely affect our profitability. Comments on these proposed changes are requested by December 8, 2009. We are unable to determine what changes will become final, when any changes would be effective, or the ultimate impact on our business operations, or our profitability.  In addition, CMS is continuing to perform audits of selected Medicare Advantage plans of various companies to validate the provider coding practices under the actuarial risk-adjustment model used to calculate the individual member capitation paid to Medicare Advantage plans. Several Humana contracts have been selected by CMS for audit for the 2007 year and we expect that CMS will conduct additional audits for the 2007 contract year and beyond. We are unable to estimate the financial impact of any audits that may be conducted related to 2007, 2008 or 2009 revenue and whether any findings would cause a change to our method of estimating future premium revenue. At this time, we do not know whether CMS will require payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology without comparison to Original Medicare coding, and using its method of extrapolating findings to the entire contract. However, if CMS requires payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology without comparison to Original Medicare coding, and using a method of extrapolating findings to the entire contract, and if we are unable to obtain any relief preventing the payment adjustments from being implemented, we believe that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  Because of the unsettled nature of the current health insurance reform efforts in Congress and the substantial regulatory changes being considered by CMS, and the numerous steps required to implement these initiatives, we cannot predict what health insurance initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, the timing of any such initiatives, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on our business, profitability, or financial condition.  As previously disclosed, in July 2009, we were notified by the Department of Defense that we were not awarded the third generation TRICARE program contract for the South Region which had been subject to competing bids. In addition, on July 22, 2009, we filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the DoD and those that appear to have been used by the DoD in making its contractor selection. On October 28, 2009, we learned that the GAO had upheld our protest. We anticipate the GAO will publicly release a detailed version of its protest decision expeditiously to include the grounds for the decision and the nature of relief recommended by the GAO to the DoD. At this time, we are not able to determine what actions the DoD will take in response to recommendations by the GAO, nor can we determine whether or not the protest decision by the GAO will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award, and therefore whether or not the protest decision is material. Our existing contract currently covers benefits for healthcare services provided to beneficiaries through March 31, 2010. Based on discussions with the DoD, we expect the government to exercise option period seven, which would extend the current contract through September 30, 2010. We are continuing to evaluate issues associated with our military services businesses such as potential impairment of certain assets primarily consisting of goodwill, which had a carrying value of $49.8 million at September 30, 2009, potential exit costs, possible asset sales, and a strategic assessment of ancillary businesses. Goodwill was not impaired at September 30, 2009.    42    Table of Contents     •    Any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper our profitability.        •    Any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.        •    If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business could be adversely affected.        •    Our mail-order pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses.        •    Our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted.        •    Downgrades in our debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.        •    Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations.        •    The securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption, which could adversely affect our business.        •    Given the current economic climate, our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility.  This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive, and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed description of these risks that may be found in this and other reports that we file with the SEC from time to time, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.
