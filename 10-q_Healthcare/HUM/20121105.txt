Item 1A. Risk Factors  Except as set forth below, there have been no changes to the risk factors included in our 2011 Form 10-K, as modified by the changes to those risk factors included in other reports we filed with the SEC subsequent to February 24, 2012:        •    The following replaces the header and first full paragraph of the corresponding risk factor included in our 2011 Form 10-K:  If we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, if we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better health care experience for our members, lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of our members, or if our estimates of benefit expenses are inadequate, our profitability may be materially adversely affected. We estimate the costs of our benefit expense payments, and design and price our products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. These estimates, however involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in payment patterns and medical cost trends.  We use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members. These costs include claims payments, capitation payments to providers (predetermined amounts paid to cover services), and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members. These costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members. Generally, premiums in the health care business are fixed for one-year periods. Accordingly, costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. We estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical inflation, historical developments, including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors. We also record benefits payable for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends. Many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums. These factors may include:        •    increased use of medical facilities and services, including prescription drugs;        •    increased cost of such services;        •    our membership mix;        •    variances in actual versus estimated levels of cost associated with new products, benefits or lines of business, product changes or benefit level changes;        •    changes in the demographic characteristics of an account or market;        •    changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services, concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals;        •    changes in our pharmacy volume rebates received from drug manufacturers;        •    catastrophes, including acts of terrorism, public health epidemics, or severe weather (e.g. hurricanes and earthquakes);    48    Table of Contents     •    the introduction of new or costly treatments, including new technologies;        •    medical cost inflation; and        •    government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, including any that result from CMS Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D risk adjustment regulatory changes or Health Insurance Reform Legislation.  Key to our operational strategy is the implementation of clinical initiatives that we believe provide a better health care experience for our members, lower these costs, and appropriately document the risk profile of our members. Our profitability and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage health care costs through, among other things, the application of medical management programs such as our chronic care management program and diabetes program.        • The following replaces, in its entirety, the corresponding risk factor included in our 2011 Form 10-K:  We are involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations, including, without limitation, an ongoing internal investigation and litigation and government requests for information related to certain aspects of our Florida subsidiary operations, any of which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business.  We are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business, including employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, securities laws claims, and tort claims.  In addition, because of the nature of the health care business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management, and offering of products and services. These include and could include in the future:        •    claims relating to the methodologies for calculating premiums;        •    claims relating to the denial of health care benefit payments;        •    claims relating to the denial or rescission of insurance coverage;        •    challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims;        •    claims relating to our administration of our Medicare Part D offerings;        •    medical malpractice actions based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for providers’ alleged malpractice;        •    claims arising from any adverse medical consequences resulting from our recommendations about the appropriateness of providers’ proposed medical treatment plans for patients;        •    allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities;        •    provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts;        •    disputes related to ASO business, including actions alleging claim administration errors;        •    qui tam litigation brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government, alleging that we, as a government contractor, submitted false claims to the government, including, among other allegations, resulting from coding and review practices under the Medicare risk-adjustment model;        •    claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices;        •    claims relating to customer audits and contract performance;        •    claims relating to dispensing of drugs associated with our in-house mail-order pharmacy; and    49    Table of Contents     •    professional liability claims arising out of the delivery of healthcare and related services to the public, including urgent care.  In some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal False Claims Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other statutes may be sought.  While we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage, or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, some types of damages, like punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance. In some jurisdictions, coverage of punitive damages is prohibited. Insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future.  The health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry. This publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation, including some large jury awards, legislative activity, regulation, and governmental review of industry practices. These factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services, may require us to change our products or services, may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate, and may require us to pay large judgments or fines. Any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
