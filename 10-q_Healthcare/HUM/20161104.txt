Item 1A. Risk FactorsThere have been no changes to the risk factors included in our 2015 Form 10-K, as supplemented by our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, other than the following:There can be no guarantees that any reconsideration that we may file with respect to certain of our Star rating measures for the 2018 bonus year will be successful, that operational measures we may take will successfully mitigate any negative effects of Star quality ratings for the 2018 bonus year, or that we will not experience a decline in membership growth for 2017 or 2018 as a result of our 2018 bonus year Star ratings.On October 12, 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published updated Star quality ratings for the 2018 bonus year, which showed that the percentage of our July 31, 2016 Medicare Advantage membership in 4-Star plans or higher had declined to approximately 37 percent from approximately 78 percent of our July 31, 2015 Medicare Advantage membership. This decline in membership in 4-Star rated plans does not take into account certain operational actions we intend to take over the coming quarters to mitigate any potential negative impact of these published ratings on Star bonus revenues for 2018. Moreover, we expect the impact of CMSâ€™ comprehensive program audit on our Star ratings to be limited to the 2018 bonus year, and Star results for the 2018 bonus year are not expected to materially impact our Medicare revenue or membership growth for 2017.We believe that our Star ratings for the 2018 bonus year do not accurately reflect our actual performance under the applicable Star measures. Consequently, we intend to file for reconsideration of certain of those ratings by CMS under the appropriate administrative process. There can be no guarantees, however, that any request for reconsideration that we may file with CMS will be successful, that any operational measures we may take will successfully mitigate all negative effects of our Star quality ratings for the 2018 bonus year, or that we will not experience a decline in membership growth for 2017 or 2018 as a result of our 2018 bonus year Star ratings.Our participation in the federal and state health insurance exchanges established under Healthcare Reform, which entail uncertainties associated with mix, volume of business and the operation of premium stabilization programs that are subject to federal administrative action, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.The Health Care Reform Law required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance that became effective January 1, 2014, with an annual open enrollment period. Insurers participating on the health insurance exchanges must offer a minimum level of benefits and are subject to guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations. We may be adversely selected by individuals who have a higher acuity level than the anticipated pool of participants in this market. In addition, the risk corridor, reinsurance, and risk adjustment provisions of the Health Care Reform Law, established to apportion risk for insurers, may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to our products. During 2015, we received our interim settlement associated with our risk corridor receivables for the 2014 coverage year. The interim settlement, representing only 12.6% of risk corridor receivables for the 2014 coverage year, was funded by HHS in accordance with previous guidance, utilizing funds HHS collected from us and other carriers under the 2014 risk corridor program. The risk corridor program 62Table of Contentsis a three year program and HHS guidance provides that risk corridor collections over the life of the three year program will first be applied to any shortfalls from previous benefit years before application to current year obligations. In September 2016, HHS announced that based on preliminary analysis, they anticipate that all 2015 coverage year risk corridor collections by HHS will be applied toward 2014 coverage year payments owed to issuers. Risk corridor payables to issuers are obligations of the United States Government under the Health Care Reform law which requires the Secretary of HHS to make full payments to issuers. In the event of a shortfall at the end of the three year program, HHS has asserted it will explore other sources of funding for risk corridor payments, subject to the availability of appropriations. In addition, regulatory changes to the implementation of the Health Care Reform Law that allowed individuals to remain in plans that are not compliant with the Health Care Reform Law or to enroll outside of the annual enrollment period may have an adverse effect on our pool of participants in the health insurance exchange. For 2017, we expect to offer on-exchange individual commercial medical plans in 11 states, a reduction from the 15 states in which we offer on-exchange coverage in 2016. In addition, we are discontinuing substantially all Health Care Reform Law compliant off-exchange individual commercial medical plans in 2017. Despite this reduction in our individual commercial membership plans, the above factors, in addition to competitor actions to withdraw from exchanges and/or alter their product offerings, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows if our premiums are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of these individuals, or if receivables associated with the reinsurance, risk corridor and risk adjustment programs are not paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable program. Any variation from our expectations regarding acuity, enrollment levels, adverse selection, or other assumptions used in setting premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
