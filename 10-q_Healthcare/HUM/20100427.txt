Item 1A. Risk Factors  Except as set forth below, there have been no changes to the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, as filed with the SEC on February 19, 2010:        •    Recently enacted health care reform, including The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with a non-deductible federal premium tax; financial position, including goodwill recoverability; and cash flows. In addition, if the new non-deductible federal premium tax is imposed as enacted, and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address this new tax, there can be no assurance that the non-deductible federal premium tax would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  The President of the United States and members of the U.S. Congress have enacted significant reforms to the U.S. health care system. On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and on March 30, 2010 the President signed into law The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.  The provisions of these new laws include, among others, imposing significant new non-deductible federal premium taxes and other assessments on health insurers, limiting Medicare Advantage payment rates, stipulating a prescribed minimum ratio for the amount of premium revenues to be expended on medical costs, additional mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with Commercial medical insurance, requirements that limit the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk, and additional regulations governing premium rate increase requests. Implementation of the provisions of these new laws generally vary from as early as six months from the date of enactment to as long as 2018.  There are numerous steps required to implement these laws including, for example, regulation necessary to determine the methodology of calculating minimum ratios for medical expenditures. Further, various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level. Because of the unsettled nature of these reforms and numerous steps required to implement them, we cannot predict what additional health insurance reforms will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect that any future legislation or regulation will have on our business. There is also considerable uncertainty of the impact of these reforms on the health insurance market as a whole and on our competitors’ actions. However, the enacted reforms as well as future legislative changes may have a material adverse affect on our results of operations, including lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the non-deductible federal premium tax, financial position, including goodwill recoverability, and cash flows. If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of health care reform, our business may be materially adversely affected. In addition, if the new non-deductible federal premium tax is imposed as enacted, and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address this new tax, there can be no assurance that the non-deductible federal premium tax would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive, and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed description of these risks that may be found in our reports filed with the SEC from time to time, including our annual reports on Form 10-K and current reports on Form 8-K.
