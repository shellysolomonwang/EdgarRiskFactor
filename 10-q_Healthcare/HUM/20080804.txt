Item 1A. Risk Factors  The Risk Factors included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2008 have not materially changed. Some of the risks which may be relevant to us could include:        •    if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of benefits payable or future policy benefits payable based upon our estimates of future benefit claims are inadequate, our profitability could be materially adversely affected;        •    if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, our membership and profitability could be materially adversely affected;        •    if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, including our Medicare initiatives, our business could be materially adversely affected;    33    Table of Contents     •    if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems, our business could be materially adversely affected;        •    we are involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages;        •    as a government contractor, we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs:  CMS has announced that it will perform audits of selected Medicare health plans each year to validate the provider coding practices under the risk adjustment model used to reimburse Medicare Advantage plans. These audits will involve a comprehensive review of medical records, and may result in contract level payment adjustments to premium payments made to a health plan pursuant to its Medicare contract with CMS. The first medical records audits will focus on risk adjustment data for 2006 that were used to determine 2007 payment amounts.  CMS has notified us that at least one of the Humana contracts will be included in a pilot audit being initiated by CMS in 2008. Additional audits may occur. CMS’s current plan is to include contract level payment adjustments, if necessary based on audit results that may occur during 2008 or 2009 prior to Humana or other Medicare Advantage plans having the opportunity to appeal audit findings. We rely on providers to appropriately document risk adjustment data in their medical records and appropriately code their claim submissions which we send to CMS as the basis for our risk adjustment model premium. We are working with CMS and our industry group to develop an orderly audit process. CMS has not yet indicated which additional contracts could be included, if any, or the details of the audit process, therefore, we are unable to predict the number of our contracts that will be audited or the methodology or outcome of these audits. However, a material adjustment would have a material affect on our financial results and cash flows;        •    our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform, could increase our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability:  The enactment of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, or the Act, in July 2008 could affect our Medicare operations. Principally, beginning in 2011 sponsors of MA PFFS plans will be required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks, except in geographic areas that CMS determines have fewer than two network-based MA plans. Additionally, the Act prohibits several different kinds of marketing activities by Medicare plan sponsors and their brokers beginning in 2009, and will phase out indirect medical education (IME) costs beginning in 2010. We have in place various operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to answer the challenges presented by the Act. We believe that neither the marketing restrictions nor the IME reductions will have a material effect on our operations. In addition, most of our PFFS enrollees reside in geographies where we have developed a PPO network and offer a PPO plan. We will continue to develop our PPO network and build network-based plan offerings to address the network restriction. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement those initiatives. Failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.        •    we are also subject to potential changes in the political environment that can affect public policy and can adversely affect the markets for our products;        •    any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper profitability;        •    any failure by us to manage acquisitions, and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects;        •    if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business could be adversely affected;        •    our recently implemented mail order pharmacy business subjects us to additional regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses;        •    our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted;    34    Table of Contents     •    downgrades in our debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations;        •    changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations; and        •    increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business.  This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. A further list and description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our reports filed with the SEC from time to time, including our annual reports on Form 10-K. Any or all forward-looking statements we make may turn out to be wrong. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
