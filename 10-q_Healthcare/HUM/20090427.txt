Item 1A. Risk Factors  The following list summarizes the risk factors described more fully in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, as filed with the SEC on February 20, 2009. Except as set forth below, there have been no changes to the risk factors included in our Annual Report:        •    If we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of benefits payable or future policy benefits payable based upon our estimates of future benefit claims are inadequate, our profitability could be materially adversely affected. We estimate the costs of our benefit expense payments, and design and price our products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. These estimates, however, involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is extremely sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends.        •    If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, including our Medicare initiatives, our business could be materially adversely affected.        •    If we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems, our business could be materially adversely affected.        •    We are involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business.        •    As a government contractor, we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs.  Reductions in payments under Medicare or the other programs under which we offer health plans could reduce our profitability. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, permits premium levels for certain Medicare plans to be established through competitive bidding, with Congress retaining the ability to limit increases in premium levels established through bidding from year to year. On April 6, 2009, CMS released final 2010 Medicare Advantage payment rates which represent an effective rate decrease of 4 to 5 percent for the industry. Reduced Medicare Advantage rates will require us to increase member premiums, reduce the benefits that we offer under our Medicare Advantage plans, or some combination thereof, thereby making them potentially less attractive to members. Congress is considering other reductions to rates or other changes to the Medicare reimbursement system which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.        •    Our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative change, could increase our cost of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability.  Although the new administration and U.S. Congress have expressed some support for measures intended to expand the number of citizens covered by health insurance and other changes within the health care system, the costs of implementing any of these proposals could     35    Table of Contents  be financed, in part, by reductions in the payments made under Medicare Advantage and other government programs. In addition, in February 2009, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that provides funding for, among other things: state Medicaid programs; the modernization of health information technology systems and aid to states to help defray budget cuts. Because of the unsettled nature of these initiatives and the numerous steps required to implement them we remain uncertain as to the ultimate impact they will have on our business.        •    We are also subject to potential changes in the political environment that can affect public policy and can adversely affect the markets for our products.        •    Any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper our profitability.        •    Any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.        •    If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business could be adversely affected.        •    Our mail-order pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses.        •    Our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted.        •    Downgrades in our debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.        •    Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  The U.S. economy continues to experience a period of recession and increased unemployment. We have closely monitored the impact that this volatile economy is having on our Commercial segment operations. Workforce reductions have caused corresponding membership losses in our small group business to be substantially higher than we previously expected. We have also experienced a decline in net investment income as a result of further decreases in interest rates and available investment yields. Therefore, continued weakness in the U.S. economy, and any resulting increases in unemployment or prolonged reduced interest rate levels, may adversely affect our Commercial medical membership, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.        •    The securities and credit markets recently have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption, which could adversely affect our business.        •    Given the current economic climate, our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility.  This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive, and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed description of these risks that may be found in our reports filed with the SEC from time to time, including our annual reports on Form 10-K and current reports on Form 8-K.
