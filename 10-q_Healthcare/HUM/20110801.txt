Item 1A. Risk Factors  Except as set forth below, there have been no changes to the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, filed with the SEC on February 17, 2011, as modified by the changes to those risk factors included in other reports we filed with the SEC subsequent to February 17, 2011:        •    On February 25, 2011, the Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity, or TMA, awarded the TRICARE South Region contract to us. On March 7, 2011, the competing bidder filed a protest of the award with the Government Accountability Office, or GAO. Also on March 7, 2011, as provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulations, TMA issued a stop work order to us in connection with the award. On June 14, 2011, the GAO upheld the award of the contract to us and TMA subsequently lifted the stop work order. On June 21, 2011, the competing bidder filed a complaint in the United States Court of Federal Claims objecting to the award of the contract to us. That case is currently pending before the Court. As a result of the award of the TRICARE South Region contract to us, we no longer expect a goodwill impairment to occur during the second half of 2011. Ultimate disposition of the contract award is, however, subject to the resolution of the complaint filed by the unsuccessful bidder.        •    Our business activities are subject to extensive government regulation relating to the privacy of individually identifiable information.  The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act – which was one part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 – significantly broadened the scope of the privacy and security regulations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. Among other requirements, the HITECH Act mandates individual notification in the event of a breach of unsecured, individually identifiable health information, provides enhanced penalties for HIPAA violations, and grants enforcement authority to states’ Attorneys General in addition to the HHS Office of Civil Rights. On October 30, 2009, HHS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing amendments to the enforcement regulations under HIPAA. On July 14, 2010, HHS issued a Proposed Rule containing modifications to privacy standards, security standards and enforcement actions. In addition, HHS is currently in the process of finalizing regulations addressing security breach notification requirements. HHS initially released an Interim Final Rule for breach notification requirements on August 24, 2009. HHS then drafted a Final Rule which was submitted to OMB but subsequently withdrawn by HHS on July 29, 2010. Currently, the Interim Final Rule remains in effect but the withdrawal suggests that when HHS issues the Final Rule, which it has indicated it intends to do in the next several months, the requirements for how covered entities should respond in the event of a potential security breach involving protected health information are likely to be more onerous than those contained in the Interim Final Rule. On May 31, 2011, HHS issued a Proposed Rule on Accounting of Disclosures greatly expanding the scope of the technical logging requirements to mandate inclusion of the names, dates and times when a record was accessed even if no action is taken on the record.  In addition, there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns, including unauthorized access or theft of personal information. State statutes and regulations vary from state to state and could impose additional penalties. Violations of HIPAA or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties, including significant monetary penalties. Compliance with HIPAA and other privacy regulations requires significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. An investigation or initiation of civil or criminal actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and our business reputation could suffer significantly.    44    Table of Contents     •    Federal government contracts account for a substantial portion of our revenue and earnings. A delay by Congress in raising the federal government’s debt ceiling, should it occur, could lead to a reduction, suspension or cancellation of federal government spending that could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.  Since 1917, the federal government’s debt ceiling, or the amount of debt the federal government is permitted to borrow, has been limited by statute and can only be raised by an act of Congress. If the federal government should approach its debt ceiling, and if Congress does not act at that time to raise the debt ceiling, federal government spending may be subject to reduction, suspension or cancellation. Because a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal government health care coverage programs, including the Medicare, Military and Medicaid programs, failure to raise the debt ceiling under these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive, and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed description of these risks that may be found in our reports filed with the SEC from time to time, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K.
