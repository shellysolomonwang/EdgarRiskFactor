Item 1A. Risk Factors  Except as set forth below, there have been no changes to the risk factors included in our 2013 Form 10-K. The following replaces in its entirety the fourth bullet under the risk factor in our 2013 Form 10-K entitled, “As a government contractor, we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs.”        •   CMS uses a risk-adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans according to health severity. The risk-adjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs. Under this model, rates paid to MA plans are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process that bases our prospective payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores, derived from medical diagnoses, to those enrolled in the government’s traditional fee-for-service Medicare program (referred to as “Medicare FFS”). Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all MA plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician providers to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk-adjusted premium payment to MA plans. We generally rely on providers, including certain providers in our network who are our employees, to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. In addition, we conduct medical record reviews as part of our data and payment accuracy compliance efforts, to more accurately reflect diagnosis conditions under the risk adjustment model. These compliance efforts include the internal contract level audits described in more detail below.  CMS is continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected MA contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data. These audits are referred to herein as Risk-Adjustment Data Validation Audits, or RADV audits. RADV audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices which influence the calculation of premium payments to MA plans.  On February 24, 2012, CMS released a “Notice of Final Payment Error Calculation Methodology for Part C Medicare Advantage Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) Contract-Level Audits”. The final payment error calculation methodology provides that, in calculating the economic impact of audit results for an MA contract, if any, the results of the audit sample will be extrapolated to the entire MA contract based upon a comparison to “benchmark” audit data in Medicare FFS (which we refer to as the “FFS Adjuster”). This comparison to a Medicare FFS benchmark audit is necessary to determine the economic impact, if any, of audit results because the government program data set, including any attendant errors that are present in that data set, provides the basis for MA plans’ risk adjustment to payment rates.  The final methodology, including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements, is expected to be applied to the next round of RADV contract level audits to be conducted on 2011 premium payments. Selected MA contracts will be notified of an audit at some point after the close of the final reconciliation for the payment year being audited. The final reconciliation occurs in August of the calendar year following the payment year. We have been notified that certain of our Medicare Advantage contracts have been selected for audit for contract year 2011.    53    Table of Contents Estimated audit settlements are recorded as a reduction of premiums revenue in our consolidated statements of income, based upon available information. During 2012, we completed internal contract level audits of certain 2011 contracts based on the RADV audit methodology prescribed by CMS. Included in these internal contract level audits was an audit of our Private Fee-For-Service business which we used to represent a proxy of the benchmark audit data in Medicare FFS which has not yet been released. We based our accrual of estimated audit settlements for contract years 2011 (the first year that application of extrapolated audit results is applicable) and 2012 on the results of these internal contract level audits for contract year 2011. Estimates derived from these results were not material to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, as indicated, we are awaiting additional guidance from CMS regarding the benchmark audit data in Medicare FFS. Accordingly, we cannot determine whether such audits will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  In addition, CMS’ recent comments in formalized guidance regarding “overpayments” to Medicare Advantage plans appear to be inconsistent with the Agency’s prior RADV audit guidance. These statements, contained in the preamble to CMS’ final rule release regarding Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug benefit program regulations for Contract Year 2015, appear to equate each Medicare Advantage risk adjustment data error with an “overpayment” without reconciliation to the principles underlying the FFS Adjuster referenced above. We will continue to work with CMS to ensure that Medicare Advantage plans are paid accurately and that payment model principles are in accordance with the requirements of the Social Security Act, which if not implemented correctly, could have material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
