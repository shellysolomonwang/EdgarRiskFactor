Item 1A. Risk Factors  Except as set forth below, there have been no changes to the risk factors included in our 2012 Form 10-K:        •    Federal government contracts account for a substantial portion of our revenue and earnings. A delay by Congress in raising the federal government’s debt ceiling, should it occur, could lead to a delay, reduction, suspension or cancellation of federal government spending that could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, and profitability.  Since 1917, the federal government’s debt ceiling, or the amount of debt the federal government is permitted to borrow, has been limited by statute and can only be raised by an act of Congress. If the federal government should approach its debt ceiling, and if Congress does not act at that time to raise the debt ceiling, federal government spending may be subject to delay, reduction, suspension or cancellation. The debt cushion now extends through February 7, 2014, with current spending levels being authorized through January 15, 2014. Because a substantial portion of our revenues relates to federal government health care coverage programs, including the Medicare, Military and Medicaid programs, failure to raise the debt ceiling and to provide for regular ongoing scheduled payments to us for both these programs and the maturation of federal government debt obligations would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.        •    Our participation in, and the operational functionality of, the new federal and state health insurance exchanges, which have experienced certain technical difficulties in their early implementation, and which entail uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  The Health Care Reform Law requires the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance that will become effective January 1, 2014. Open enrollment on the exchanges began on October 1, 2013 and continues until March 31, 2014. Among other things, the exchanges have websites where individuals and small businesses can shop for and purchase health insurance. Certain health insurance exchange websites have experienced certain technical difficulties in their early implementation. The accessibility and functionality of the exchange websites and the accuracy of the information we are provided from them by the federal and state governments are central to both the enrollment process and our ability to understand and service this new member population.  The Health Care Reform Law requires insurers participating on the health insurance exchanges to offer a minimum level of benefits while including guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations. We may be adversely selected by individuals who will have a higher acuity level than the anticipated pool of participants in this market. In addition, the risk corridor, reinsurance, and risk adjustment provisions of the Health Care Reform Law, established to adequately apportion risk for insurers, may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to our exchange products. These factors, along with the limited information about the individuals who have access to these newly established exchanges that was available when we established premiums, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if our premiums are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of these individuals. Any variation from our expectations regarding acuity, enrollment levels, adverse selection, or other assumptions utilized in setting adequate premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.    52    Table of Contents Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
