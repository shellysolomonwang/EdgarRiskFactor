Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part II of this Form 10-Q.  Government Segment  Our strategy and commitment to the Medicare programs have led to significant growth. Medicare Advantage fully-insured membership increased to 1,732,400 members at June 30, 2010, up 232,600 members, or 15.5% from 1,499,800 members at June 30, 2009 and up 223,900 members, or 14.8%, since December 31, 2009, primarily due to sales of group Medicare Advantage products and preferred provider organization, or PPO, products. Average fully-insured Medicare Advantage membership increased 16.5% in the first half of 2010 compared to the first half of 2009. Likewise, Medicare Advantage premium revenues have increased 18.2% to $9.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010 from $8.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2009. The mix of sales has continued to shift increasingly to our network-based PPO offerings, which is particularly important given the enactment of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, or the Improvements Act, discussed more fully below. Approximately 72% of our fully-insured Medicare Advantage members were enrolled in network-based products at June 30, 2010 compared to 63% at December 31, 2009 and 62% at June 30, 2009, with our PPO membership increasing 82% from June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2010.  Due to the enactment of the Improvements Act in July 2008, beginning in 2011, sponsors of Medicare Advantage Private Fee-For-Service, or PFFS, plans will be required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks, except in geographic areas that CMS determines have fewer than two network-based Medicare Advantage plans. We have 479,300 PFFS members, which represent approximately 27% of our total Medicare Advantage membership at June 30, 2010, down from 37% at December 31, 2009. Approximately 85% of our PFFS members at June 30, 2010 resided in geographies where we have developed a provider network and offer a networked plan. We are continuing to implement various operational and strategic initiatives, including further developing our networks and building network-based plan offerings to address the adequate network requirement. We anticipate these initiatives, together with certain counties’ exemption from the network requirement, to result in more than 95% of our PFFS members having the choice of remaining in a Humana plan in 2011.  On April 5, 2010, CMS announced that Medicare Advantage payment rates will remain flat in 2011. Based on the information available at the time we filed our 2011 bids in June 2010, we believe we effectively designed Medicare Advantage products that address the flat rates while continuing to remain competitive compared to both the combination of original Medicare with a supplement policy as well as other Medicare Advantage competitors within our industry. In addition, we will continue to pursue our cost-reduction and outcome-enhancing strategies, including care coordination and disease management, which we believe will mitigate the adverse effects of the rates on our Medicare Advantage members. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute operational and strategic initiatives with respect to changes in the Medicare Advantage program. Failure to    24    Table of Contents  execute these strategies may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  We also offer Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under the Medicare Part D program. These plans provide varying degrees of coverage. Our Medicare stand-alone PDP membership declined to 1,793,400 members at June 30, 2010, down 134,500 members, or 7.0%, from December 31, 2009 and down 198,600 members, or 10.0%, from June 30, 2009, resulting primarily from our competitive positioning as we realigned stand-alone PDP premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience.  Our quarterly Government segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins annually on January 1 for renewals. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. As a result, the Government segment’s benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses. In addition, the number of low-income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our stand-alone PDP products affect the quarterly benefit ratio pattern.  Our military services business primarily consists of the TRICARE South Region contract. For the six months ended June 30, 2010, premiums and ASO fees associated with the TRICARE South Region contract were $1,725.5 million, or 10.3% of our total premiums and ASO fees.  On March 3, 2010, the TMA exercised its options to extend the TRICARE South Region contract for Option Period VII and Option Period VIII. The exercise of these option periods extends the TRICARE South Region contract through March 31, 2011. In July 2009, we were notified by the DoD that we were not awarded the third generation TRICARE program contract for the South Region which had been subject to competing bids. We filed a protest with the GAO in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the DoD and those that appear to have been used by the DoD in making its contractor selection. In October 2009, we learned that the GAO had upheld our protest, determining that the TMA evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the South Region. On December 22, 2009, we were advised that TMA notified the GAO of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the GAO’s decision with respect to our protest. On July 15, 2010, TMA issued its latest amendment to the request for proposal requesting from offerors final proposal revisions to address health care cost savings resulting from provider network discounts in the South Region. On July 30, 2010, we submitted our proposal revisions.  We are continuing to evaluate issues associated with our military services businesses such as potential impairment of certain assets primarily consisting of goodwill, which had a carrying value of $49.8 million at June 30, 2010, potential exit costs, possible asset sales, and a strategic assessment of ancillary businesses. Military services goodwill was not impaired at June 30, 2010. We expect that as the ultimate March 31, 2011 contract end date nears, if our current contract is not extended further and we are not awarded the new third generation TRICARE program contract for the South Region, future cash flows will not be sufficient to warrant recoverability of all or a portion of the military services goodwill. In this event, we expect a goodwill impairment could occur during the fourth quarter of 2010.  Commercial Segment  Commercial segment pretax earnings decreased $17.7 million, or 10.9%, for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to a $147.5 million write-down of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual major medical policies in the 2010 period as well as a decline in fully-insured medical membership, partially offset by decreased utilization year-over-year and prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business in the first half of 2010. As a result of significant reforms to the U.S. health insurance industry discussed previously, a substantial portion of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual major medical block of business were not recoverable from future income and we recorded a charge to selling, general, and administrative expense of $147.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2010 as    25    Table of Contents  discussed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Commercial segment fully-insured medical membership at June 30, 2010 of 1,702,500 decreased 169,200 members, or 9.0% from June 30, 2009. The decline in membership primarily was a result of continued pricing discipline, the highly competitive environment, and economic conditions including high levels of unemployment. Due to the economic conditions, small groups have been dropping coverage and we have experienced increased in-group member attrition as employers reduce their workforce levels. The decreased utilization year-over-year coupled with the favorable reserve releases in the 2010 period led to a lower Commercial segment benefit ratio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010. The write-down of deferred acquisition costs, together with administrative costs associated with increased specialty and mail-order pharmacy business, led to a higher Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010.  Financial Position   At June 30, 2010, cash, cash equivalents and our investment securities totaled $10.3 billion, or 65.6% of total assets, with 19.4% of the $10.3 billion invested in cash and cash equivalents. Investment securities consist of debt securities of investment-grade quality with an average credit rating by S&P of AA at June 30, 2010 and an average duration of approximately 4.2 years. Including cash and cash equivalents, the average duration of our investment portfolio was approximately 3.4 years. We had no collateralized debt obligations and $3.8 million of mortgage-backed securities associated with Alt-A or subprime loans at June 30, 2010.  Our net unrealized position improved $183.3 million from a net unrealized gain position of $71.4 million at December 31, 2009, to a net unrealized gain position of $254.7 million at June 30, 2010. Gross unrealized losses were $36.0 million at June 30, 2010 compared to $78.4 million at December 31, 2009. Gross unrealized gains were $290.7 million at June 30, 2010 compared to $149.8 million at December 31, 2009. All issuers of securities we own trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments. We believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased. As of June 30, 2010, we do not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized costs basis. As a result, we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of June 30, 2010.  We continuously review our investment portfolios. There were no material other-than-temporary impairments for the six months ended June 30, 2010 or 2009. There is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods.  In addition, in the fall of 2008 we terminated all fixed-to-variable interest-rate swap agreements outstanding associated with our senior notes based on changes in the credit market environment. In exchange for terminating these interest-rate swap agreements, we received cash of $93.0 million representing the fair value of the swap assets. This transaction also fixed the interest rate on our senior notes to a weighted-average rate of 6.08%. We may re-enter into swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors.  We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares. Our long-term debt, consisting primarily of senior notes, of $1,673.6 million represented 20.5% of total capitalization at June 30, 2010 declining from 22.5% at December 31, 2009. The earliest maturity of our senior notes is in June 2016. We have available a 5-year, $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which expires in July 2011. As of June 30, 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement.  Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required.    26    Table of Contents Based on the most recently filed statutory financial statements as of March 31, 2010, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $4.0 billion in our state regulated subsidiaries, $1.6 billion above the aggregate $2.4 billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states.  Other Highlights        •    As more fully described on page 59 of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business. We experienced prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business in both our Government and Commercial segments of approximately $37.5 million in the aggregate, or $0.14 per diluted common share, for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and $137.5 million in the aggregate, or $0.51 per diluted common share, for the six months ended June 30, 2010. This favorable reserve development primarily resulted from improvements in the claims processing environment and to a lesser extent, better than originally estimated utilization. In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2010, we experienced first quarter 2010 favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business in both our Government and Commercial segments of approximately $79.5 million in the aggregate, or $0.30 per diluted common share, that did not affect year-to-date results, primarily as a result of better than originally estimated utilization. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate of benefits payable.        •    Operating cash flows increased $872.6 million to $1,080.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to $207.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. The increase primarily was due to earnings improvement, enrollment activity, and the timing of working capital items.        •    The number of employees decreased by 1,200, or 4.3%, to 26,900 at June 30, 2010 from 28,100 at December 31, 2009, as we align the size of our workforce with our membership. We expect continued workforce attrition during the remainder of 2010.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  In January 2010, the FASB issued new guidance that expands and clarifies existing disclosures about fair value measurements. Under the new guidance, we are required to disclose additional information about movements of assets among the three-tier fair value hierarchy, present separately (that is, on a gross basis) information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements of financial instruments in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), and expand disclosures regarding the determination of fair value measurements. We adopted the new disclosure provisions for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, except for the gross disclosures regarding purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements which will be effective for us beginning with the filing of our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2011.  We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes.    27    Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2010 and 2009  The following discussion primarily deals with our results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2010, or the 2010 quarter, the three months ended June 30, 2009, or the 2009 quarter, the six months ended June 30, 2010, or the 2010 period, and the six months ended June 30, 2009, or the 2009 period.

These tables of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion that follows.  Summary  Net income was $340.1 million, or $2.00 per diluted common share, in the 2010 quarter compared to $281.8 million, or $1.67 per diluted common share, in the 2009 quarter. Net income was $598.8 million, or $3.52 per diluted common share, in the 2010 period compared to $487.5 million, or $2.89 per diluted common share, in the 2009 period. The increase primarily was due to improved operating performance in the Government segment as a result of an increase in average Medicare Advantage membership as well as prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business in the first half of 2010 in both our Government and Commercial segments, partially offset by a $147.5 million ($0.55 per diluted common share) write-down of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual major medical policies in our Commercial Segment in the 2010 quarter as discussed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. The prior year favorable reserve development (approximately $0.14 per diluted common share in the 2010 quarter and $0.51 per diluted common share in the 2010 period) primarily resulted from improvements in the claims processing environment and to a lesser extent, better than originally estimated utilization. The 2010 quarter also included first quarter 2010 favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business in both our Government and Commercial segments ($0.30 per diluted common share) primarily as a result of better than originally estimated utilization. Net income for the 2009 period also included the favorable impact of the reduction of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits ($0.10 per diluted common share) as a result of audit settlements.  Premium Revenues and Medical Membership  Premium revenues increased $734.2 million, or 9.6%, to $8.4 billion for the 2010 quarter, compared to $7.6 billion for the 2009 quarter. For the 2010 period, premium revenues were $16.5 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 9.4%, compared to $15.1 billion for the 2009 period. These increases primarily were due to higher premium revenues in the Government segment. Premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums. Items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as    30    Table of Contents  changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership.  Government segment premium revenues increased $770.1 million, or 13.1%, to $6.6 billion for the 2010 quarter compared to $5.9 billion for the 2009 quarter. For the 2010 period, Government segment premium revenues were $13.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 12.9%, compared to $11.6 billion for the 2009 period. The increase primarily was attributable to higher average Medicare Advantage membership and an increase in per member premiums. Average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period. Average fully-insured Medicare Advantage membership increased 15.9% for the 2010 quarter and 16.5% for the 2010 period compared to the 2009 quarter and period, respectively. Of the 232,600 increase in fully-insured Medicare Advantage members since June 30, 2009, approximately 108,000 members were associated with a new group Medicare Advantage contract added during the first quarter of 2010, with sales of our PPO products driving the majority of the increase in individual Medicare Advantage membership. Total fully-insured group Medicare Advantage membership was 269,500 at June 30, 2010, an increase of 171,400 members from 98,100 at June 30, 2009. Medicare Advantage per member premiums increased approximately 1.7% during the 2010 quarter and 1.5% during the 2010 period compared to the 2009 quarter and period, respectively. Medicare stand-alone PDP premium revenues increased $61.4 million, or 9.6%, during the 2010 quarter compared to the 2009 quarter and $44.8 million, or 3.6%, during the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period. These increases primarily were due to increases in Medicare stand-alone PDP per member premiums of 17.4% during the 2010 quarter and 14.8% during the 2010 period compared to the 2009 quarter and period, respectively, partially offset by declines in average PDP membership of 6.7% for the 2010 quarter and 9.7% for the 2010 period compared to the 2009 quarter and period, respectively. The decline in stand-alone PDP membership principally resulted from our competitive positioning as we realigned stand-alone PDP premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience.  Commercial segment premium revenues decreased $35.9 million, or 2.0%, to $1.7 billion for the 2010 quarter. For the 2010 period, Commercial segment premium revenues decreased $67.0 million, or 1.9% to $3.5 billion compared to $3.6 billion for the 2009 period. The decreases primarily were due to a decline in fully-insured membership, partially offset by an increase in per member premiums. Fully-insured membership decreased 9.0%, or 169,200 members, to 1,702,500 at June 30, 2010 compared to 1,871,700 at June 30, 2009 primarily due to the impact of the highly competitive environment and economic conditions including high levels of unemployment which have led to small groups dropping coverage and increased in-group member attrition as employers reduce their workforce levels. Per member premiums for fully-insured group accounts increased 8.0% during the 2010 quarter and 7.7% during the 2010 period compared to the 2009 quarter and period, respectively.  Administrative Services Fees  Our administrative services fees were $126.7 million for the 2010 quarter, an increase of $8.0 million, or 6.7%, from $118.7 million for the 2009 quarter. For the 2010 period, administrative services fees were $252.6 million, an increase of $18.0 million, or 7.7%, from $234.6 million for the 2009 period. The increases primarily were due to an increase in membership. Our ASO membership declined by approximately 114,000 members on July 1, 2010 due to the loss of a large group account.  Investment Income  Investment income totaled $79.8 million for the 2010 quarter, an increase of $4.5 million from $75.3 million for the 2009 quarter. For the 2010 period, investment income totaled $165.2 million, an increase of $20.3 million from the $144.9 million for the 2009 period. These increases primarily are reflecting higher average invested balances as a result of the reinvestment of operating cash flows, partially offset by lower interest rates.  Other Revenue  Other revenue totaled $69.4 million for the 2010 quarter, an increase of $7.1 million from $62.3 million for the 2009 quarter. Other revenue totaled $136.8 million for the 2010 period, an increase of $19.5 million from $117.3 million for the 2009 period. The increases primarily were attributable to increased revenue from growth related to RightSourceRxSM, our mail-order pharmacy.    31    Table of Contents Benefit Expense  Consolidated benefit expense was $6.9 billion for the 2010 quarter, an increase of $492.0 million, or 7.7%, from $6.4 billion for the 2009 quarter. For the 2010 period, consolidated benefit expense was $13.7 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 8.2%, from $12.6 billion for the 2009 period. The increases primarily were driven by an increase in the average number of Medicare Advantage members, as described below.  The consolidated benefit ratio for the 2010 quarter was 81.9%, a 140 basis points decrease from 83.3% for the 2009 quarter. For the 2010 period, the consolidated benefit ratio was 82.6%, a 100 basis point decrease from 83.6% for the 2009 period. The decreases primarily were attributable to a decline in the Commercial segment benefit ratio, as described below.  The Government segment’s benefit expenses increased $650.2 million, or 13.2%, in the 2010 quarter compared to the 2009 quarter. For the 2010 period, the Government segment’s benefit expenses increased $1.2 billion, or 12.4%, from the 2009 period. The increases primarily were due to an increase in the average number of Medicare Advantage members. The Government segment’s benefit ratio for the 2010 quarter was 84.1%, equivalent to the benefit ratio for the 2009 quarter. For the 2010 period, the Government segment’s benefit ratio was 85.0%, a 40 basis point decrease from the 2009 period of 85.4%, primarily driven by a 40 basis point decline in the Medicare benefit ratio. The decline in the Medicare benefit ratio primarily resulted from prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business of an estimated $24.8 million in the 2010 quarter and $110.7 million in the 2010 period, as well as first quarter 2010 reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business of an estimated $52.4 million in the 2010 quarter. These favorable reserve releases decreased the Government segment benefit ratio by approximately 120 basis points in the 2010 quarter and 90 basis points in the 2010 period. Excluding the impact of these favorable reserve releases, the increase in the benefit ratio resulted from growth in our Medicare Advantage group business which generally carries a higher benefit ratio than our individual Medicare Advantage business.  The Commercial segment’s benefit expenses decreased $158.2 million, or 11.0%, during the 2010 quarter compared to the 2009 quarter. For the 2010 period, the Commercial segment’s benefit expenses decreased $191.8 million, or 6.9%, from the 2009 period. The decreases primarily were due to a decline in fully-insured membership and prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business of an estimated $12.7 million in the 2010 quarter and $26.8 million in the 2010 period, as well as first quarter 2010 reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business of an estimated $27.1 million in the 2010 quarter. Fully-insured membership decreased 9.0%, or 169,200 members, to 1,702,500 at June 30, 2010 compared to 1,871,700 at June 30, 2009 primarily due to continued pricing discipline as well as the impact of the highly competitive environment and economic conditions including high levels of unemployment which have led to small groups dropping coverage and increased in-group member attrition as employers reduce their workforce levels. The benefit ratio for the Commercial segment of 73.4% for the 2010 quarter decreased 740 basis points from the 2009 quarter benefit ratio of 80.8%. For the 2010 period, the Commercial segment’s benefit ratio of 73.7% decreased 400 basis points from the 2009 period’s benefit ratio of 77.7%. The decreases primarily were due to lower utilization year-over-year, prior period favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business in the first half of 2010, and continued pricing discipline. Utilization trend levels were higher in the prior periods primarily from the effects of the economy including, for example, members utilizing more benefits ahead of actual or perceived layoffs, as well as the impact of the H1N1 virus. The favorable reserve releases decreased the Commercial segment benefit ratio by approximately 220 basis points in the 2010 quarter and 80 basis points in the 2010 period.  SG&A Expense  Consolidated SG&A expenses increased $157.4 million, or 15.7%, during the 2010 quarter compared to the 2009 quarter. For the 2010 period, consolidated SG&A expenses increased $220.7 million, or 10.7%, from the 2009 period. The increases primarily were due to the $147.5 million write-down of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual major medical policies in the 2010 quarter, as well as administrative costs associated with servicing higher average Medicare Advantage membership, partially offset by a decrease in the number of employees as a result of our administrative cost reduction strategies including planned workforce reductions in 2010. The number of employees decreased by 1,700 to 26,900 at June 30, 2010 from 28,600 at June 30, 2009, or 5.9%, and decreased by 1,200, or 4.3%, from 28,100 at December 31, 2009, as we align the size of our workforce with our membership. We expect continued workforce attrition during the remainder of 2010.  The consolidated SG&A expense ratio for the 2010 quarter was 13.6%, increasing 80 basis points from 12.8% for the 2009 quarter. For the 2010 period, the consolidated SG&A expense ratio was 13.5% compared to 13.4% for    32    Table of Contents  the 2009 period. The increases primarily were due to an increase in the Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio, as described below.  Our Government and Commercial segments incur both direct and shared indirect overhead SG&A expenses. We allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent.  SG&A expenses in the Government segment decreased $1.9 million, or 0.3%, during the 2010 quarter compared to the 2009 quarter. For the 2010 period, the SG&A expenses of $1,198.9 million increased $50.8 million, or 4.4%, from the 2009 period. The increase primarily was due to administrative costs associated with servicing higher average Medicare Advantage membership. The Government segment SG&A expense ratio decreased 110 basis points from 9.3% for the 2009 quarter to 8.2% for the 2010 quarter. For the 2010 period, the Government segment SG&A expense ratio of 9.2% decreased 70 basis points from 9.9% for the 2009 period. The decreases primarily resulted from efficiency gains associated with servicing higher average Medicare Advantage membership as well as our continued focus on administrative cost reductions.  The Commercial segment SG&A expenses increased $159.3 million, or 35.1%, during the 2010 quarter compared to the 2009 quarter. Commercial segment SG&A expenses increased $169.9 million, or 18.5%, during the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period. The Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio increased 870 basis points from 23.5% for the 2009 quarter to 32.2% for the 2010 quarter. For the 2010 period, the Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio of 28.5% increased 470 basis points from 23.8% for the 2009 period. The increases primarily were due to a $147.5 million write-down of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual major medical policies in the 2010 quarter, as well as administrative costs associated with increased specialty and mail-order pharmacy business, partially offset by our continued focus on administrative cost reductions. The $147.5 million write-down of deferred acquisition costs increased the SG&A expense ratio 780 basis points in the 2010 quarter and 390 basis points in the 2010 period.  Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and amortization for the 2010 quarter totaled $69.3 million compared to $60.5 million for the 2009 quarter, an increase of $8.8 million, or 14.5%. Depreciation and amortization for the 2010 period totaled $132.0 million compared to $118.5 million for the 2009 period. The increases primarily reflect depreciation expense associated with capital expenditures.  Interest Expense  Interest expense was $26.2 million for the 2010 quarter, compared to $26.6 million for the 2009 quarter, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 1.5%. Interest expense was $52.5 million for the 2010 period compared to $53.3 million for the 2009 period, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 1.5%. The decreases primarily were due to lower average outstanding debt, partially offset by higher interest rates.  Income Taxes  Our effective tax rate during the 2010 quarter of 36.5% compared to the effective tax rate of 36.0% in the 2009 quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2010 period of 37.1% was higher than the 2009 period of 33.6%. The increase from the 2009 period to the 2010 period primarily was due to the reduction of the $16.8 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits as a result of audit settlements which reduced the effective income tax rate by 2.3% during the 2009 period. In addition, the tax rates for the 2010 quarter and period reflect the estimated impact of new limitations on the deductibility of annual employee compensation in excess of $500,000 as mandated by recent health insurance reforms.    33    Table of Contents Membership  The following table presents our medical and specialty membership at June 30, 2010, March 31, 2010, and at the end of each quarter in 2009:                        2010   2009      June 30   March 31   Dec. 31   Sept. 30   June 30   March 31   Medical Membership:                     Government segment:                     Medicare Advantage   1,732,400   1,713,300   1,508,500   1,514,800   1,499,800   1,468,900   Medicare Advantage ASO   28,700   29,000   0   0   0   0                             Total Medicare Advantage   1,761,100   1,742,300   1,508,500   1,514,800   1,499,800   1,468,900                             Medicare stand-alone PDP   1,793,400   1,917,100   1,927,900   1,960,400   1,992,000   2,078,900                             Total Medicare   3,554,500   3,659,400   3,436,400   3,475,200   3,491,800   3,547,800                             Military services   1,759,800   1,756,800   1,756,000   1,754,300   1,753,400   1,746,600   Military services ASO   1,270,900   1,274,600   1,278,400   1,260,800   1,254,900   1,244,000                             Total military services   3,030,700   3,031,400   3,034,400   3,015,100   3,008,300   2,990,600                             Medicaid   404,000   398,600   401,700   399,800   393,600   385,200                             Total Government   6,989,200   7,089,400   6,872,500   6,890,100   6,893,700   6,923,600                             Commercial segment:                     Fully-insured   1,702,500   1,743,000   1,839,500   1,860,700   1,871,700   1,893,700   ASO   1,582,600   1,588,500   1,571,300   1,566,200   1,576,200   1,577,800                             Total Commercial   3,285,100   3,331,500   3,410,800   3,426,900   3,447,900   3,471,500                             Total medical members   10,274,300   10,420,900   10,283,300   10,317,000   10,341,600   10,395,100                             Specialty Membership:                     Commercial segment(a)   7,297,000   7,237,900   7,109,900   7,073,700   6,585,800   6,535,100                               (a) The Commercial segment provides a full range of insured specialty products including dental, vision, and other supplemental products. Members could be counted more than once since members have the ability to choose multiple products.  Liquidity  Our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums, ASO fees, and investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings. Our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments, SG&A expenses, interest on borrowings, taxes, purchases of investment securities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayments on borrowings, and share repurchases. Because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months, our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment. Conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment. The use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital.  Cash and cash equivalents increased to $1,999.0 million at June 30, 2010 from $1,613.6 million at December 31, 2009. The change in cash and cash equivalents for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 is summarized as follows:                    2010     2009        (in thousands)     Net cash provided by operating activities   $ 1,079,962     $ 207,380     Net cash used in investing activities     (672,141 )      (445,077 )    Net cash used in financing activities     (22,427 )      (147,617 )                      Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents   $ 385,394     $ (385,314 )                      34    Table of Contents Cash Flow from Operating Activities  The increase in operating cash flows from the 2009 period to the 2010 period primarily results from earnings improvement, enrollment activity, and the timing of working capital items. Cash flows were positively impacted by Medicare enrollment gains in the 2010 period because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months. Conversely, during the 2009 period, cash flows were negatively impacted by the payment of run-off claims associated with enrollment losses in our stand-alone PDP business.  Comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital. The most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefit expenses and receipts for premiums and ASO fees. We illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables.  The detail of benefits payable was as follows at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009:                         June 30,2010   December 31,2009   2010 PeriodChange   2009 PeriodChange        (in thousands)     IBNR(1)   $ 2,141,137   $ 1,902,700   $ 238,437   $ 96,574     Military services benefits payable(2)     301,731     279,195     22,536     36,589     Reported claims in process(3)     376,340     357,718     18,622     (60,490 )    Other benefits payable(4)     1,010,515     682,961     327,554     132,945                                 Total benefits payable   $ 3,829,723   $ 3,222,574   $ 607,149   $ 205,618                                   (1) IBNR represents an estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date. The level of IBNR is primarily impacted by membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower IBNR).    (2) Military services benefits payable primarily results from the timing of the cost of providing health care services to beneficiaries and the payment to the provider. A corresponding receivable for reimbursement by the federal government is included in the base receivable in the receivables table on the following page.    (3) Reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling, as well as amounts owed to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff.    (4) Other benefits payable include amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements.  The increases in benefits payable from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2010 and from December 31, 2008 to June 30, 2009 primarily were due to an increase in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements as well as an increase in IBNR, both primarily as a result of Medicare Advantage membership growth.    35    Table of Contents The detail of total net receivables was as follows at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009:                            June 30,2010     December 31,2009     2010 PeriodChange     2009 PeriodChange        (in thousands)     Military services:                       Base receivable   $ 468,812     $ 451,248     $ 17,564     $ 86,513     Change orders     1,851       2,024       (173 )      961                                       Military services subtotal     470,663       453,272       17,391       87,474           Medicare     638,100       238,056       400,044       397,881     Commercial and other     267,500       183,124       84,376       4,840     Allowance for doubtful accounts     (51,161 )      (50,832 )      (329 )      (2,963 )                                      Total net receivables   $ 1,325,102     $ 823,620       501,482       487,232                                 Reconciliation to cash flow statement:                       Receivables from acquisition               0       6,907                                 Change in receivables per cash flow statement             $ 501,482     $ 494,139                               Military services base receivables consist of estimated claims owed from the federal government for health care services provided to beneficiaries and underwriting fees. The claim reimbursement component of military services base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period. The timing of claim reimbursements resulted in the $17.6 million increase in base receivables from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2010 and the $86.5 million increase in base receivables from December 31, 2008 to June 30, 2009.  Medicare receivables increased $400.0 million from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2010 compared to an increase of $397.9 million from December 31, 2008 to June 30, 2009. Medicare receivables are impacted by the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the CMS risk-adjustment model, contractually scheduled for mid-year collection. In connection with the July 2010 CMS receipt, we collected $418.6 million associated with the CMS risk-adjustment model. This is consistent with the collection pattern in 2009.  The timing of reimbursements from the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration for our Medicaid business resulted in the $84.4 million increase in commercial and other receivables from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2010 and the $4.8 million increase from December 31, 2008 to June 30, 2009.  In addition to the timing of receipts for premiums and ASO fees and payments of benefit expenses, other working capital items impacting operating cash flows primarily resulted from the timing of payments for the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions of our contracts with CMS. Payment under the risk corridor provisions is made in the fourth quarter.  Cash Flow from Investing Activities  We reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities, primarily fixed income securities, totaling $653.9 million in the 2010 period and $483.8 in the 2009 period. Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing, billing and collections, medical utilization review, and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $91.4 million in the 2010 period compared to $82.6 million in the 2009 period. Excluding acquisitions, we expect total capital expenditures in 2010 of approximately $200 million.  Cash Flow from Financing Activities  Receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were $236.3 million higher than claims payments during the 2010 period and $311.2 million higher than claim payments during the 2009 period.    36    Table of Contents During the 2010 period, we repurchased approximately 1.03 million shares for $50.0 million under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors in December 2009. During the 2009 period, there were no repurchases of common shares under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors.  Net borrowings under our credit agreement decreased $250.0 million in the 2009 period primarily from the repayment of amounts borrowed to fund a 2008 acquisition.  The remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in the 2010 and 2009 periods primarily resulted from the change in the securities lending payable. The decrease in securities lending since 2008 resulted from lower margins earned under the program.  Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity  Stock Repurchase Authorization  In December 2009, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans. Under this share repurchase authorization, shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, by block purchases, or in privately-negotiated transactions, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing, and timing. During the 2010 period, we repurchased 1.03 million shares in open market transactions for $50.0 million at an average price of $48.76. As of August 1, 2010, the remaining authorized amount totaled $200.0 million and the authorization expires on December 31, 2011.  Senior Notes  We previously issued $500 million of 6.45% senior notes due June 1, 2016, $500 million of 7.20% senior notes due June 15, 2018, $300 million of 6.30% senior notes due August 1, 2018, and $250 million of 8.15% senior notes due June 15, 2038. The 7.20% and 8.15% senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded (or subsequently upgraded) and contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances. All four series of our senior notes, which are unsecured, may be redeemed at our option at any time at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest and a specified make-whole amount. Concurrent with the senior notes issuances, we entered into interest-rate swap agreements to exchange the fixed interest rate under these senior notes for a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. During 2008, we terminated all of our swap agreements. We may re-enter into interest rate swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors.  Credit Agreement  Our 5-year, $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement expires in July 2011. Under the credit agreement, at our option, we can borrow on either a revolving credit basis or a competitive advance basis. The revolving credit portion bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The spread, currently 50 basis points, varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from 27 to 80 basis points. We also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently 12.5 basis points, may fluctuate between 8 and 20 basis points, depending upon our credit ratings. In addition, a utilization fee of 10 basis points is payable for each day in which borrowings under the facility exceed 50% of the total $1.0 billion commitment. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based on LIBOR, at our option.  The terms of the credit agreement include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse event clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth of $3,687.4 million at June 30, 2010 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0:1. We are in compliance with the financial covenants, with actual net worth of $6,478.8 million and a leverage ratio of 0.7:1, as measured in accordance with the credit agreement as of June 30, 2010.    37    Table of Contents At June 30, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement. We have outstanding letters of credit of $3.5 million secured under the credit agreement. No amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2010, we had $996.5 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement, none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement. We have other customary, arms-length relationships, including financial advisory and banking, with some parties to the credit agreement.  Other Long-Term Borrowings  Other long-term borrowings of $37.3 million at June 30, 2010 represent junior subordinated debt assumed in an acquisition of $36.1 million and financing for the renovation of a building of $1.2 million. The junior subordinated debt, which is due in 2037, may be called by us in 2012 and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 8.02% payable quarterly until 2012, and then payable at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus 310 basis points. The debt associated with the building renovation bears interest at 2.00%, is collateralized by the building, and is payable in various installments through 2014.  Liquidity Requirements  We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares.  Adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Our investment-grade credit rating at June 30, 2010 was BBB- according to Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, or S&P, and Baa3 according to Moody’s Investors Services, Inc., or Moody’s. A downgrade by S&P to BB+ or by Moody’s to Ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to $750 million of our senior notes. Successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points, or annual interest expense by $1.9 million, up to a maximum 100 basis points, or annual interest expense by $7.5 million.  In addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. The parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the parent company increased $335.9 million to $1,001.5 million at June 30, 2010 compared to $665.6 million at December 31, 2009. We continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries.  Regulatory Requirements  Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required.  Although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Based on the most recently filed statutory financial statements as of March 31, 2010, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $4.0 billion in our state regulated subsidiaries, $1.6 billion above the aggregate $2.4 billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states.    38    Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk  Our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk, including those resulting from changes in interest rates.  The level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense. Until October 7, 2008, we exchanged the fixed interest rate under all of our senior notes for a variable interest rate based on LIBOR using interest rate swap agreements. As a result, changes in interest rates generally resulted in an increase or decrease to investment income partially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase to interest expense, partially hedging our exposure to interest rate risk. However, due to extreme volatility in the securities and credit markets, LIBOR increased while the interest rate we would earn on invested assets like cash and cash equivalents decreased. As a result, we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements, fixing the average interest rate under our senior notes at 6.08%. In exchange for terminating our rights under the interest rate swap agreements, we received $93.0 million in cash from the counterparties representing the fair value of the swap assets. We may re-enter into interest rate swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors. Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit portion of our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement bear interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. There were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at June 30, 2010.  Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio, consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investment-grade quality with an average S&P credit rating of AA at June 30, 2010. Our net unrealized position improved $183.3 million from a net unrealized gain position of $71.4 million at December 31, 2009 to a net unrealized gain position of $254.7 million at June 30, 2010. As of June 30, 2010, we had gross unrealized losses of $36.0 million on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased, and as such, there were no material other-than-temporary impairments during the six months ended June 30, 2010. While we believe that these impairments are temporary and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities, given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods.  Duration is the time-weighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow. Duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates, providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates. However, actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration. The average duration of our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was approximately 3.4 years as of June 30, 2010. Based on the duration including cash equivalents, a 1% increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately $344 million.  Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, our Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, and our Principal Accounting Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures for the quarter ended June 30, 2010.  Based on our evaluation, our CEO, CFO, and Principal Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information the Company is required to disclose in its reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, including, without limitation, ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.    39    Table of Contents Part II. Other Information  Item 1. Legal Proceedings  For a description of the legal proceedings pending against us, see “Legal Proceedings” in Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements beginning on page 17 of this Form 10-Q.  Item 1A. Risk Factors  Except as set forth below, there have been no changes to the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2010, as modified by the changes to those risk factors included in other reports we filed with the SEC subsequent to February 19, 2010:        •    Recently enacted health insurance reform, including The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, increasing our medical and administrative costs by, among other things, requiring a minimum benefit ratio, lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with a non-deductible federal premium tax; financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill; and cash flows. In addition, if the new non-deductible federal premium tax is imposed as enacted, and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address this new tax, there can be no assurance that the non-deductible federal premium tax would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  In March 2010, the President signed into law The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (which we collectively refer to as the Health Insurance Reform Legislation) which enact significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry. Due to its complexity and the lack of comprehensive interpretive guidance or implementing regulations by The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor, the Treasury Department, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the full impact of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation is not yet fully known.  The provisions of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation include, among others, imposing significant new non-deductible federal premium taxes and other assessments on health insurers, limiting Medicare Advantage payment rates, stipulating a prescribed minimum ratio for the amount of premium revenues to be expended on medical costs, additional mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with Commercial medical insurance, requirements that limit the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk, heightened scrutiny by state and federal regulators of our business practices, including our Medicare bid and pricing practices, and additional regulations governing premium rate increase requests. Implementation dates of the provisions of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation generally vary from as early as six months from the date of enactment, or September 23, 2010, to as late as 2018.  There are numerous steps required to implement the Health Insurance Reform Legislation including, for example, additional regulations to be promulgated by HHS to address important aspects of measuring and applying the minimum required benefit ratios. Further, various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level. Because of the unsettled nature of these reforms and numerous steps required to implement them, we cannot predict what additional health insurance reforms will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect that any future legislation or regulation will have on our business. However, it is reasonably possible that the Health Insurance Reform Legislation and related regulations, as well as future legislative changes, in the aggregate could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations, including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, increasing our medical and administrative costs, lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the non-deductible federal premium tax; financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill; and cash flows. If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation, our business may be materially adversely affected. In addition, if the new non-deductible federal premium tax is imposed as enacted, and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address this new tax, there can be no assurance that the non-deductible federal premium tax    40    Table of Contents  would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part I of this Form 10-Q.  This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive, and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed description of these risks that may be found in our reports filed with the SEC from time to time, including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K.
