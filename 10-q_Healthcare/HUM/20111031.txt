Item 1A. Risk Factors  Except as set forth below, there have been no changes to the risk factors included in our 2010 Form 10-K, as modified by the changes to those risk factors included in other reports we filed with the SEC subsequent to February 17, 2011:        •    On February 25, 2011, the Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity, or TMA, awarded the TRICARE South Region contract to us. On March 7, 2011, the competing bidder filed a protest of the award with the Government Accountability Office, or GAO. Also on March 7, 2011, as provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulations, TMA issued a stop work order to us in connection with the award. On June 14, 2011, the GAO upheld the award of the contract to us and TMA subsequently lifted the stop work order. On June 21, 2011, the competing bidder filed a complaint in the United States Court of Federal Claims objecting to the award of the contract to us. On October 14, 2011, the Court upheld the award of the contract to us, and the competing bidder has until December 13, 2011 to appeal it in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. As a result of the award of the TRICARE South Region contract to us, we no longer expect a goodwill impairment to occur during the second half of 2011. Ultimate disposition of the contract award is, however, subject to the resolution of any additional actions the unsuccessful bidder may take.        •    As a government contractor, we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs.  A significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs, including the Medicare, Military, and Medicaid programs. These programs accounted for approximately 77% of our total premiums and services revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. These programs involve various risks, as described in our 2010 Form 10-K and supplemented as follows:        •    The Budget Control Act of 2011, enacted on August 2, 2011, increased the United States debt ceiling in connection with deficit reductions over the next ten years. The Budget Control Act of 2011 also establishes a twelve-member joint committee of Congress known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose legislation to reduce the United States federal deficit by $1.5 trillion for fiscal years 2012-2021. Reductions in Medicare and Medicaid spending could be included as part of these deficit reduction measures. Moreover, if such legislation is not enacted by December 23, 2011, approximately $1.2 trillion in domestic and defense spending reductions will automatically begin January 1, 2013, split evenly between domestic and defense spending. Payments to Medicare providers would be subject to these automatic spending reductions, subject to a 2% cap. At this time it is unclear how this automatic reduction may be applied to various Medicare healthcare programs. We expect that if such reductions were to occur, there would be a corresponding substantial reduction in our obligations to providers, however there can be no assurances that this would completely offset any reductions to the Medicare healthcare programs applied by the Budget Control Act of 2011.  This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive, and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed description of these risks that may be found in our reports filed with the SEC from time to time, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K.    48    Table of Contents Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
