Item 1A. Risk Factors  The Risk Factors included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2008 have not materially changed. Some of the risks which may be relevant to us could include:        •    if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of benefits payable or future policy benefits payable based upon our estimates of future benefit claims are inadequate, our profitability could be materially adversely affected;        •    if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, our membership and profitability could be materially adversely affected;        •    if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, including our Medicare initiatives, our business could be materially adversely affected;        •    if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems, our business could be materially adversely affected;        •    we are involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages;        •    as a government contractor, we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs:  CMS recently announced that it will perform an audit of selected Medicare health plans each year to validate the provider coding practices under the HCC risk adjustment model used to reimburse Medicare Advantage plans. These audits will involve a comprehensive review of medical records, and may result in adjustments to premium payments made to a health plan pursuant to its Medicare contract with CMS. The first medical records audits will focus on risk adjustment data for 2006 that were used to determine 2007 payment amounts. We are unable to predict if we will be selected for audits, or if selected, the outcome of the audits. However, a material adjustment would have a material affect on our financial results and cash flows;        •    our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform, could increase our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability;        •    we are also subject to potential changes in the political environment that can affect public policy and can adversely affect the markets for our products;        •    any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper profitability;        •    any failure by us to manage acquisitions, and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects;        •    if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business could be adversely affected;        •    our recently implemented mail order pharmacy business subjects us to additional regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses;        •    our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted;        •    downgrades in our debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations;        •    changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations; and        •    increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business.    30    Table of Contents This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive.
