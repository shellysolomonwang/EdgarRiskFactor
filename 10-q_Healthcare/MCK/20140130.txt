Item 1A.Risk Factors.Following is an update to our risk factors. There have been no other material changes during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with our acquisition of Celesio.On January 23, 2014, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Dragonfly GmbH & Co. KGaA (“McKesson AcquiCo”), entered into (i) an amendment to the Business Combination Agreement dated October 24, 2013 (“BCA Amendment”) with Celesio AG (“Celesio”), (ii) an amended and restated Share Purchase Agreement dated October 24, 2013 (“SPA”) with Franz Haniel & Cie. GmbH (“Haniel”), and (iii) a Bond Purchase Agreement (“BPA” with Elliott International, L.P., The Liverpool Limited Partnership and Elliott Capital Advisers, L.P. (the “Elliott Group”). Following the execution of the Agreements, McKesson AcquiCo announced the commencement of a new voluntary public tender offer for the remaining shares of Celesio.Under the terms of the SPA, McKesson AcquiCo will unconditionally acquire from Haniel a stake comprising approximately 75.99% of the Celesio shares currently outstanding for €23.50 per share. Under the terms of the BPA, McKesson AcquiCo will unconditionally acquire from the Elliott Group 4,840 of the 7,000 convertible bonds issued by Celesio Finance B.V. in the nominal aggregate amount of €350 million due in October 2014, and 2,180 of the 3,500 convertible bonds issued by Celesio Finance B.V in the nominal amount of €350 million due in April 2018 (together, the “Bonds”) currently outstanding. The SPA and BPA are expected to close on February 6, 2014, which will result in McKesson AcquiCo achieving more than 75% ownership of Celesio shares on a fully diluted basis following a conversion of the Bonds into Celesio shares. The total value of the SPA and BPA is approximately €3.7 billion (or, assuming a currency exchange ratio of $1.37/€1, approximately $5.1 billion). In addition to the risks and uncertainties that are described in Part I, Item 1A, of our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors - Our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully,” we may face certain risks and uncertainties associated with our acquisition of Celesio.32Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONAchieving the anticipated benefits of the Celesio acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including foreign exchange fluctuations, challenges of managing new international operations, and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of Celesio’s product and services. While we have successfully integrated large companies into our operations in the past, and therefore expect a successful integration in this case, the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. It is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated, and could result in the loss of employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses, processes and systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Celesio acquisition and which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition. Any significant diversion of management’s attention away from the ongoing businesses, and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition, transition and integration process, could adversely affect our financial results, both prior to and after the acquisition of Celesio. Moreover, the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Events outside of our control, including the market price of Celesio shares and convertible bonds that we will not acquire upon closing of the SPA and BPA, changes in regulations and laws, as well as economic trends, could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from our acquisition of Celesio.The process for acquiring Celesio, as contemplated by the share purchase, bond purchase and the business combination agreements, is complex and we do not expect to complete the steps required to exercise operating control of Celesio until late in the first half of our fiscal 2015. Our pursuit of the Celesio acquisition and the preparation for the integration of Celesio’s business over an extended period of time may place a significant burden on our management and internal resources, as well as the management and internal resources of Celesio. In the event that our acquisition of Celesio’s remaining outstanding common shares and convertible bonds thereof is significantly delayed, it may prevent the Celesio acquisition from being consummated on the anticipated timeline, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, and could result in our incurring significant expenses related to the Celesio acquisition without realizing the expected benefits.We entered into a $5.5 billion senior bridge term loan agreement in connection with the acquisition of Celesio, which contains terms substantially similar to our existing revolving credit facility. While we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including the senior bridge term loan agreement and our existing revolving credit and sales facilities, will provide us with the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future (including the financing for the Celesio acquisition), there can be no assurance that our incurrence of additional indebtedness, or volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets, will not impair our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to obtain at commercially acceptable terms permanent financing for our acquisition of Celesio.Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
