Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our 2007 Form 10-K, except as follows: Beginning near the end of the third quarter of 2008, dramatic changes in the global financial markets weakened global economic conditions. These changes have not had, nor do we anticipate they will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. Due to our significant operating cash flow, financial assets, access to the capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving-credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. As market conditions change, we will continue to monitor our liquidity position. However, there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by recent and possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
