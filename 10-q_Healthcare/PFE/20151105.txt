Item 1A. Risk FactorsThe “Our Operating Environment” and “Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results” sections of the MD&A and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K are incorporated by reference herein. There have been no material changes from the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as follows:We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of Hospira.  The success of our acquisition of Hospira will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our businesses. Anticipated benefits and cost savings may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. The integration process may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, including third party relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. We also may fail to generate the revenue growth for the acquired business that we expected entering into the transaction. In addition, Hospira has experienced manufacturing disruptions and increased regulatory scrutiny due to quality issues. Future manufacturing problems, as well as any corrective actions and their operational implementation, could adversely impact the revenue we generate from products acquired from Hospira and result in substantial unanticipated costs.Risks relating to our announcement regarding Allergan plc (Allergan)On October 29, 2015, we issued an announcement confirming that we are in preliminary friendly discussions with Allergan in relation to a potential transaction. No agreement has been reached and there can be no certainty that these discussions will be pursued or lead to a transaction, as to the terms on which a transaction, if any, might be agreed, or, if a transaction is agreed to, as to whether it will be completed or the timing thereof.There are substantial risks and uncertainties related to a potential transaction between Pfizer and Allergan, including, without limitation, the possibility that a transaction will not be pursued or that a transaction will not be agreed to, adverse effects on the market price of Pfizer's common stock and on Pfizer's operating results because of a failure to pursue or to complete a potential transaction, if a transaction is agreed to, the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to satisfy any of the other 100conditions to a potential transaction, failure to realize the expected benefits of a potential transaction, negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of an agreed transaction, if any, on the market price of Pfizer’s common stock, significant transaction costs and/or unknown liabilities, general economic and business conditions that affect the companies following a potential transaction, changes in global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax laws, regulations, rates and policies, future business combinations or disposals and competitive developments.101Item 2.
