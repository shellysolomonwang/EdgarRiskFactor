Item 1A. Risk Factors   The “Our Operating Environment” and “Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results” sections of the MD&A and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K are incorporated by reference herein. There have been no material changes from the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as follows:           ●   On April 23, 2012, we entered into an agreement to sell our Nutrition operating segment to Nestlé. The transaction is subject to our ability and Nestlé’s ability to obtain the regulatory clearances required in certain jurisdictions and to satisfy the other conditions to closing the sale. (For further information, see the “Our Operating Environment – Our Business Development Initiatives” section of the MD&A.)               ●    As discussed above in Part I, Item 4, “Controls and Procedures”, we continue to pursue a multi-year initiative to outsource some transaction-processing activities within certain accounting processes and are migrating to a consistent enterprise resource planning system across the organization. These are enhancements of ongoing activities to support the growth of our financial shared service capabilities and standardize our financial systems. If any difficulties in the migration to or in the operation of the new system were to occur, they could adversely affect our operations, including, among other ways, through a failure to meet demand for our products, or adversely affect our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations.             76                Item 2.
