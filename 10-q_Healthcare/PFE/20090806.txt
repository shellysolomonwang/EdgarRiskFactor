Item 1A. Risk Factors  There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our 2008 Form 10-K except for the addition of the following risk factors:       ·    Several lawsuits have been filed against Wyeth, the members of the Wyeth board of directors, Pfizer and/or Wagner Acquisition Corp. challenging the pending acquisition, and an adverse judgment in such lawsuits may prevent the acquisition from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.          Wyeth, the members of the Wyeth board of directors, Pfizer and/or Wagner Acquisition Corp. are named as defendants in purported class action lawsuits brought by Wyeth stockholders challenging the pending acquisition, seeking, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from consummating the acquisition on the agreed-upon terms.     One of the conditions to the closing of the acquisition is that no judgment, order, injunction (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent), decision, opinion or decree issued by a court or other governmental entity in the United States or the European Union that makes the acquisition illegal or prohibits the consummation of the acquisition shall be in effect. As such, if the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the defendants from consummating the acquisition on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the acquisition from becoming effective, or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.    Reference is made to the discussion above in Part II – Other Information; Item 1. Legal Proceedings, of this Form 10-Q, regarding an agreement in principle to settle the actions pending in state court in Delaware, which settlement would include a release of all claims related to the merger, including the claims asserted in the actions challenging the merger that are pending in other jurisdictions.           ·     Healthcare and tax reform proposals in the U.S.           As discussed in Part I, Item 1A, of our 2008 Form 10-K, U.S. and foreign governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations. In that connection, legislation or regulatory action that may result from pending and possible future healthcare reform proposals in the U.S. could have a significant adverse effect on our business.      Also as discussed in Part I, Item 1A, of our 2008 Form 10-K, our future results could be adversely affected by changes in taxation requirements in the U.S. and other countries. In that connection, changes affecting the taxation by the U.S. of income earned outside the U.S. that may result from pending and possible future proposals could have a significant adverse effect on our business.         57          Item 2.
