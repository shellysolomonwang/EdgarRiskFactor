Item 1A. Risk Factors  There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our 2008 Form 10-K except for the addition of the following risk factor related to our pending acquisition of Wyeth:  Several lawsuits have been filed against Wyeth, the members of the Wyeth board of directors, Pfizer and/or Wagner Acquisition Corp. challenging the pending acquisition, and an adverse judgment in such lawsuits may prevent the acquisition from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.     Wyeth, the members of the Wyeth board of directors, Pfizer and/or Wagner Acquisition Corp. are named as defendants in purported class action lawsuits brought by Wyeth stockholders challenging the pending acquisition, seeking, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from consummating the acquisition on the agreed-upon terms.      One of the conditions to the closing of the acquisition is that no judgment, order, injunction (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent), decision, opinion or decree issued by a court or other governmental entity in the United States or the European Union that makes the acquisition illegal or prohibits the consummation of the acquisition shall be in effect. As such, if the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the defendants from consummating the acquisition on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the acquisition from becoming effective, or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.        54          Item 2.
