ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS    There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2015, except as follows.   Political and economic uncertainty arising from the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business.   On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. The U.K.’s voluntary exit from the European Union, generally referred to as “Brexit,” triggered short-term financial volatility. Brexit also resulted in significant volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations, which has resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. A process of negotiation will be required to determine the future terms of the U.K.’s relationship with the European Union, and the uncertainty before, during and after the period of negotiation could result in further volatility in global financial markets. It is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and European Union countries and increased regulatory and tax complexities. Political and economic uncertainty resulting from Brexit and any other similar referenda could cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, including affecting our relationships with existing and potential customers, suppliers and employees. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business. During 2015, approximately 8% of our consolidated net sales were invoiced to customers in the U.K. and approximately 27% of our consolidated net sales were invoiced to customers in Europe overall (including the U.K.).
