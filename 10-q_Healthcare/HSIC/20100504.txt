ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as follows:   Recently enacted legislation may adversely impact us.   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in March 2010, generally known as The Health Care Reform Bill, imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals beginning in January 2012. Implementing regulations have not yet been issued, but it is possible that such regulations, when issued, will treat us or one or more of our subsidiaries as a “manufacturer” subject to these reporting requirements. In addition, several states require pharmaceutical and/or device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of products as well as gifts and payments to individual practitioners in the states, or prohibit certain marketing related activities. Other states, such as California, Nevada, and Massachusetts, require pharmaceutical and/or device companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Wholesale distributors are covered by the laws in certain of these states. In others, it is possible that our activities or the activities of one or more of our subsidiaries will subject us to the state’s reporting requirements and prohibitions.   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also imposes (i) a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers and importers beginning in 2013, which we may need to assist implementing and which may affect sales, and (ii) mandates pharmacy benefit manager transparency regarding rebates, discounts and price concessions, which could affect pricing and competition.          25      Table of Contents    ITEM 2.

Executive-Level Overview   We believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to office-based healthcare practitioners. We serve more than 600,000 customers worldwide, including dental practitioners and laboratories, physician practices and animal health clinics, as well as government and other institutions. We believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 77 years of experience distributing healthcare products.   We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ more than 13,500 people (of which over 5,500 are based outside the United States) and have operations in the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We also have affiliates in Iceland, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.   We have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency. This infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs. Our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.        26      Table of Contents    We conduct our business through two reportable segments: healthcare distribution and technology. These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. The healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental, medical, animal health and international operating segments. This segment consists of consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large dental and medical equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.   Our dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, schools and other institutions in the combined United States and Canadian dental market. Our medical group serves office-based medical practitioners, surgical centers, other alternate-care settings and other institutions throughout the United States. Our animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics throughout the United States. Our international group serves dental, medical and animal health practitioners in 21 countries outside of North America and is what we believe to be a leading European healthcare supplier serving office-based practitioners.   Our technology group provides software, technology and other value-added services to healthcare practitioners, primarily in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Our value-added practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics. Our technology group offerings also include financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services and continuing education services for practitioners.   Industry Overview   In recent years, the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment. This trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices. It also has accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support. We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management.   Our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business, domestically and internationally, in part to address significant changes in the healthcare industry, including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies, potential healthcare reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare and collective purchasing arrangements.   Our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty, particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services.   Industry Consolidation   The healthcare products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based healthcare practitioners, is highly fragmented and diverse. This industry, which encompasses the dental, medical and animal health markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $29.0 billion in 2009 in the combined North American and European markets. The industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices.   Due in part to the inability of office-based healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to office-based healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment. The purchasing decisions within an office-based healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant. Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.        27      Table of Contents    We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities. This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.   Our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry. This trend has resulted in expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with, and thus strengthen, the acquired businesses.   As industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend, as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure.   As the healthcare industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction, if pursued. If additional transactions are entered into or consummated, we would incur merger and/or acquisition-related costs, and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful.   Aging Population and Other Market Influences   The healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population, increased healthcare awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the affects of increased unemployment on insurance coverage. In addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’ offices.   The January 2000 U.S. Bureau of the Census estimated that the elderly population in the United States will more than double by the year 2040. In 2000, four million Americans were aged 85 or older, the segment of the population most in need of long-term care and elder-care services. By the year 2040, that number is projected to more than triple to more than 14 million. The population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to more than double in the same time period.   As a result of these market dynamics, annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the United States. Given current operating, economic and industry conditions, we believe that demand for our products and services will grow at slower rates. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, published “National Health Expenditure Projections 2008 – 2018” indicating that total national healthcare spending reached $2.4 trillion in 2008, or 16.6% of the nation’s gross domestic product, the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the United States. Healthcare spending is projected to reach $4.4 trillion in 2018, approximately 20.3% of the nation’s gross domestic product.   Government Influences   The healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation, licensure and operating compliance procedures. Additionally, government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 was the largest expansion of the Medicare program since its inception, and provided participants with voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefits beginning in 2006. This Act also included provisions relating to medication management programs, generic substitution and provider reimbursement. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, enacted in March 2010, generally known as The Health Care Reform Bill, increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of healthcare generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to health coverage for an additional 32 million people. The Patient        28      Table of Contents    Protection and Affordable Care Act also imposes (i) a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers and importers beginning in 2013, which we may need to assist implementing and which may affect sales, and (ii) mandates pharmacy benefit manager transparency regarding rebates, discounts and price concessions, which could affect pricing and competition.   In addition to the foregoing, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners, including physicians and dentists, and teaching hospitals beginning in January 2012. Implementing regulations have not yet been issued, but it is possible that such regulations, when issued, will treat us or one or more of our subsidiaries as a “manufacturer” subject to these reporting requirements. In addition, several states require pharmaceutical and/or device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of products as well as gifts and payments to individual practitioners in the states, or prohibit certain marketing related activities. Other states, such as California, Nevada, and Massachusetts, require pharmaceutical and/or device companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Wholesale distributors are covered by the laws in certain of these states. In others, it is possible that our activities or the activities of one or more of our subsidiaries will subject us to the state’s reporting requirements and prohibitions.   Regulations adopted under the federal Prescription Drug Marketing Act, effective December 2006, require the identification and documentation of transactions involving the receipt and distribution of prescription drugs, that is, drug pedigree information. In early December 2006, the federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York issued a preliminary injunction, enjoining the implementation of some of the federal drug pedigree requirements, in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors. On December 31, 2009, the U.S. District Court granted a motion to extend the time for either party to re-open the matter (which had been administratively closed in light of potential legislative action by Congress), and the Court in effect extended the injunction through September 30, 2010. Other states and government agencies are currently considering similar laws and regulations. We continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation.   There have been increasing efforts by various levels of government, including state departments of health, state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. An increasing number of states, including Florida, have already adopted laws and regulations, including drug pedigree tracking requirements, that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system. California has enacted a statute that, beginning in 2015, will require manufacturers to identify each package of a prescription pharmaceutical with a standard, machine-readable numerical identifier, and will require manufacturers and distributors to participate in an electronic track-and-trace system and provide or receive an electronic pedigree for each transaction in the drug distribution chain. Bills have been introduced in Congress that would impose similar requirements at the federal level.   There may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting healthcare.   E-Commerce   Traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions. Our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition. The advancement of online commerce will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings.   Through our proprietary, technologically-based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives. We believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business. We continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities.        29      Table of Contents    Results of Operations   The following table summarizes the significant components of our operating results from continuing operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 27, 2010 and March 28, 2009 (in thousands):           Three Months Ended          March 27,       March 28,          2010       2009 (1)      Operating results:                Net sales    $ 1,760,310     $ 1,485,388     Cost of sales      1,247,277       1,047,025      Gross profit      513,033       438,363     Operating expenses:                     Selling, general and administrative      396,989       343,732      Restructuring costs      12,285       4,043      Operating income    $ 103,759     $ 90,588                        Other expense, net    $ (5,814 )   $ (3,921 )   Income from continuing operations      67,252       59,183     Income from continuing operations attributable                     to Henry Schein, Inc.      60,900       54,774                        Cash flows:                    Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities    $ 21,675     $ (27,128 )   Net cash used in investing activities      (144,412 )     (27,880 )   Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities      5,640       (6,434 )                            (1)    Adjusted to reflect the effects of a discontinued operation.        Plans of Restructuring   On November 5, 2008, we announced certain actions to reduce operating costs. These actions included the elimination of approximately 430 positions from our operations and the closing of several smaller facilities.   During the first quarter of 2010, we completed an additional restructuring in order to further reduce operating expenses. This restructuring included headcount reductions of 184 positions, as well as the closing of a number of smaller locations.   For the three months ended March 27, 2010, we recorded restructuring costs of approximately $12.3 million (approximately $8.3 million after taxes) consisting of employee severance pay and benefits, facility closing costs, representing primarily lease termination and asset write-off costs, and outside professional and consulting fees directly related to the restructuring plan. The costs associated with the restructuring are included in a separate line item, “Restructuring costs” within our consolidated statements of income.          30      Table of Contents    Three Months Ended March 27, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended March 28, 2009   Net Sales   Net sales from continuing operations for the three months ended March 27, 2010 and March 28, 2009 were as follows (in thousands):           March 27,       % of       March 28,       % of       Increase / (Decrease)          2010       Total       2009 (1)       Total       $       %     Healthcare distribution (2):                                           Dental (3)    $ 614,649       34.9 %   $ 593,956       40.0 %   $ 20,693       3.5 %    Medical (4)      284,589       16.2       271,762       18.3       12,827       4.7      Animal health (5)      206,646       11.7       55,626       3.7       151,020       271.5      International (6)      609,453       34.6       523,719       35.3       85,734       16.4      Total healthcare distribution      1,715,337       97.4       1,445,063       97.3       270,274       18.7     Technology (7)      44,973       2.6       40,325       2.7       4,648       11.5      Total    $ 1,760,310       100.0 %   $ 1,485,388       100.0 %   $ 274,922       18.5                                                              (1) Adjusted to reflect the effects of a discontinued operation.

The $274.9 million, or 18.5%, increase in net sales for the three months ended March 27, 2010 includes an increase of 14.6% local currency growth (3.2% increase in internally generated revenue and 11.4% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 3.9% related to foreign currency exchange.   The $20.7 million, or 3.5%, increase in dental net sales for the three months ended March 27, 2010 includes an increase of 1.8% in local currencies (1.0% increase in internally generated revenue and 0.8% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 1.7% related to foreign currency exchange. The 1.8% increase in local currency sales was due to increases in dental equipment sales and service revenues of 0.8% (0.5% increase in internally generated revenue and 0.3% growth from acquisitions) and dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 2.0% (1.2% increase in internally generated revenue and 0.8% growth from acquisitions).   The $12.8 million, or 4.7%, increase in medical net sales for the three months ended March 27, 2010 includes an increase in internally generated revenue of 2.4% and acquisition growth of 2.3%.   The $151.0 million, or 271.5%, increase in animal health sales for the three months ended March 27, 2010 includes an increase in internally generated revenue of 2.5% and acquisition growth of 269.0%, due to the acquisition of a majority interest in Butler Animal Health Supply, LLC.   The $85.7 million, or 16.4%, increase in international net sales for the three months ended March 27, 2010 includes sales growth of 7.5% in local currencies (6.2% internally generated growth and 1.3% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 8.9% related to foreign currency exchange.   The $4.7 million, or 11.5%, increase in technology net sales for the three months ended March 27, 2010 includes an increase of 9.4% local currency growth (4.6% internally generated growth and 4.8% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 2.1% related to foreign currency exchange.        31      Table of Contents    Gross Profit   Gross profit and gross margin percentages from continuing operations by segment and in total for the three months ended March 27, 2010 and March 28, 2009 were as follows (in thousands):           March 27,       Gross       March 28,       Gross       Increase / (Decrease)          2010       Margin %       2009 (1)       Margin %       $       %                                              Healthcare distribution    $ 482,010       28.1 %   $ 409,202       28.3 %   $ 72,808       17.8 %   Technology      31,023       69.0       29,161       72.3       1,862       6.4      Total    $ 513,033       29.1     $ 438,363       29.5     $ 74,670       17.0                                                           (1) Adjusted to reflect the effects of a discontinued operation.   For the three months ended March 27, 2010, gross profit increased $74.7 million, or 17.0%, from the comparable prior year period. As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies. Additionally, we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution segment. These higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products, as well as certain financial services. For a number of reasons, the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development.   Healthcare distribution gross profit increased $72.8 million, or 17.8%, for the three months ended March 27, 2010 from the comparable prior year period. Healthcare distribution gross profit margin decreased to 28.1% for the three months ended March 27, 2010 from 28.3% for the comparable prior year period primarily due to changes in the product sales mix.   Technology gross profit increased $1.9 million, or 6.4%, for the three months ended March 27, 2010 from the comparable prior year period. Technology gross profit margin decreased to 69.0% for the three months ended March 27, 2010 from 72.3% for the comparable prior year period primarily due to changes in the product sales mix.

Other Expense, Net   Other expense, net, from continuing operations for the three months ended March 27, 2010 and March 28, 2009 were as follows (in thousands):           March 27,       March 28,       Increase / (Decrease)          2010       2009 (1)       $       %                                  Interest income    $ 3,388     $ 2,801     $ 587       21.0 %   Interest expense      (9,087 )     (6,752 )     (2,335 )     (34.6 )   Other, net      (115 )     30       (145 )     (483.3 )    Other expense, net    $ (5,814 )   $ (3,921 )   $ (1,893 )     (48.3 )                                            (1) Adjusted to reflect the effects of a discontinued operation.      Other expense, net increased $1.9 million for the three months ended March 27, 2010 from the comparable prior year period. Interest expense increased $2.3 million due to interest associated with the acquisition of Butler Animal Health Supply, LLC partially offset by reduced interest expense resulting from repayment of our $130.0 million senior notes on June 30, 2009. Interest income increased $0.6 million as a result of increased late fee income partially offset by lower interest income on our invested funds.     Income Taxes   For the three months ended March 27, 2010, our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 32.9% compared to 33.3% for the prior year period. The difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes.        33      Table of Contents    Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our principal capital requirements include the funding of working capital needs, repayments of debt principal, funding of acquisitions, purchases of securities and fixed assets and repurchases of common stock. Working capital requirements generally result from increased sales, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables. Historically, sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buy-in opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year, causing our working capital requirements to have been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year.   We finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit facilities and debt placements. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services, and access to products and services from our suppliers.    Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $21.7 million for the three months ended March 27, 2010, compared to net cash flow used of $27.1 million for the comparable prior year period. This net change of $48.8 million was primarily attributable to favorable working capital changes and net income improvements.   Net cash used in investing activities was $144.4 million for the three months ended March 27, 2010, compared to $27.9 million for the comparable prior year period. The net change of $116.5 million was primarily due to an increase in payments for business acquisitions and purchases of marketable securities. We expect to invest approximately $35 million to $45 million during the remainder of the fiscal year in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and computer systems and to integrate certain operations into our existing structure.   Net cash provided by financing activities was $5.6 million for the three months ended March 27, 2010, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $6.4 million for the comparable prior year period. The net change of $12.0 million was primarily due to an increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and increased tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries.   The following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources (in thousands):           March 27,       December 26,          2010       2009                     Cash and cash equivalents    $ 355,388     $ 471,154     Available-for-sale securities - short-term      26,980       -     Available-for-sale securities - long-term      17,649       18,848     Working capital      1,205,501       1,127,279                        Debt:                     Bank credit lines    $ 9     $ 932      Current maturities of long-term debt      25,630       23,560      Long-term debt      522,882       243,373      Total debt    $ 548,521     $ 267,865                  34      Table of Contents    Our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity.   As of March 27, 2010, we have approximately $19.8 million ($17.6 million net of temporary impairments) invested in auction-rate securities (“ARS”). ARS are publicly issued securities that represent long-term investments, typically 10-30 years, in which interest rates had reset periodically (typically every 7, 28 or 35 days) through a “dutch auction” process. Approximately $17.8 million ($15.6 million net of temporary impairments) of our ARS are backed by student loans that are backed by the federal government and the remaining $2.0 million are invested in closed-end municipal bond funds. Our ARS portfolio is comprised of investments that are rated AAA by major independent rating agencies. Since the middle of February 2008, these auctions have failed to settle due to an excess number of sellers compared to buyers. The failure of these auctions has resulted in our inability to liquidate our ARS in the near term. We are currently not aware of any defaults or financial conditions that would negatively affect the issuers’ ability to continue to pay interest and principal on our ARS. We continue to earn and receive interest at contractually agreed upon rates. We believe that the current lack of liquidity related to our ARS investments will have no impact on our ability to fund our ongoing operations and growth opportunities. As of March 27, 2010, we have classified ARS holdings as long-term, available-for-sale and they are included in the Investments and other line within our consolidated balance sheets.   As of March 27, 2010, we have approximately $27.0 million invested in treasury securities, agency securities and FDIC-backed certificates of deposit. These securities, which we intend to hold to maturity, have a maturity period of six months or less.   Our business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and our desired level of inventory. We anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements.   Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from continuing operations decreased to 39.6 days as of March 27, 2010 from 43.2 days as of March 28, 2009. Our inventory turns from continuing operations increased to 6.3 as of March 27, 2010 from 5.8 as of March 28, 2009. Our working capital accounts may be impacted by current and future economic conditions.   In 2004, we completed an issuance of $240.0 million of convertible debt. These notes are senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 3.0% and are due to mature on August 15, 2034. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion ratio of 21.58 shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $46.34 per share, under the following circumstances:       ·    if the price of our common stock is above 130% of the conversion price measured over a specified number of trading days;          ·    during the five-business-day period following any 10-consecutive-trading-day period in which the average of the trading prices for the notes for that 10-trading-day period was less than 98% of the average conversion value for the notes during that period;          ·    if the notes have been called for redemption; or          ·     upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or specified corporate transactions, as defined in the note agreement.            35      Table of Contents    Upon conversion, we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of the notes to be converted, in cash, with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of our common stock. We currently have sufficient availability of funds through our $400.0 million revolving credit facility (discussed below) along with cash on hand to fully satisfy our debt obligations, including the cash portion of our convertible debt. We also will pay contingent interest during any six-month-interest period beginning August 20, 2010, if the average trading price of the notes is above specified levels. We may redeem some or all of the notes on or after August 20, 2010. The note holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on August 15, 2010, 2014, 2019, 2024 and 2029 or, subject to specified exceptions, upon a change of control event. If we are required by the note holders to purchase all or a portion of the notes, we expect to use our existing credit line to fund such purchase; therefore, we have classified our convertible debt as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet.   Our $20.0 million of remaining senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.7% per annum and mature on September 27, 2010. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually.   On September 5, 2008, we entered into a new $400.0 million revolving credit facility with a $100.0 million expansion feature. The $400.0 million credit line expires in September 2013. This credit line replaced our then existing $300.0 million revolving credit line, which would have expired in May 2010. As of March 27, 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility and there were $10.2 million of letters of credit provided to third parties.   Effective December 31, 2009, Butler Animal Health Supply, LLC, a majority-owned subsidiary whose financials are consolidated with ours, incurred approximately $320.0 million of debt (of which $37.5 million was provided by Henry Schein, Inc.) in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in Butler Animal Health Supply, LLC. The resulting consolidated balance of $282.5 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of March 27, 2010.   The debt incurred as part of the acquisition of BAHS is repayable in 23 quarterly installments of $0.8 million through September 30, 2015, and a final installment of $301.6 million on December 31, 2015. Interest on the BAHS debt is charged at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.5% with a LIBOR floor of 2% for a current effective rate of 5.5% as of March 27, 2010. The debt agreement contains provisions which, under certain circumstances, require BAHS to make prepayments of the loan commitment based on excess cash flows of BAHS as defined in the debt agreement.   Under our common stock repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors, we have $57.7 million available for future common stock share repurchases. During the quarter ended March 27, 2010, we did not repurchase any of our common stock.   Some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value based on third-party valuations. ASC Topic 480-10 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements. The components of the change in the fair value of the Redeemable noncontrolling interests for the periods ended March 27, 2010 and December 26, 2009 are presented in the following table:           March 27,  2010       December 26,  2009      Balance, beginning of period    $ 178,570     $ 233,035     Net increase (decrease) in noncontrolling interests due to                     business acquisitions or redemptions      114,021       (72,427 )   Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests      6,339       21,975     Dividends paid      (1,278 )     (5,973 )   Effect of foreign currency translation attributable to                     noncontrolling interests      (3,487 )     2,541     Change in fair value of redeemable securities      (7,630 )     (581 )   Balance, end of period    $ 286,535     $ 178,570              36      Table of Contents    Changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Additional paid-in capital. Future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded. The recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level. These adjustments will not impact the calculation of earnings per share.   Additionally, some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain profitability targets are met. For acquisitions completed prior to 2009, we accrue liabilities that may arise from these transactions when we believe that the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt. For 2009 and future acquisitions, as required by ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations,” we will accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of additional purchase price adjustments at the time of the acquisition. Any adjustments to these accrual amounts will be recorded in our consolidated statement of income.   We finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months. Funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion, may change. Consequently, we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements.   We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets, and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short-term and long-term capital needs. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2009.     Recently Issued Accounting Standards   Accounting Pronouncements Adopted   During February 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2010-09, “Subsequent Events (Topic 855)”. The amended guidance in ASU 2010-09 states that an entity that is an SEC filer is required to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued, but is not required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. The adoption of the provisions of this amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.   During January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.” ASU 2010-06 includes new disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements, including transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 and information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements for Level 3 fair value measurements. This update also clarifies existing disclosure requirements relating to levels of disaggregation and disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques. The new disclosures are required in interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except the disclosures relating to Level 3 activity are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Effective December 28, 2009, we have adopted the provisions relating to Level 1 and Level 2 disclosures and such provisions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.            37      Table of Contents    ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   There have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk from that disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2009.     ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 27, 2010 to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and that all such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   The combination of recent acquisition activity and integrations undertaken during the quarter, when considered in the aggregate, represents a material change in our internal control over financial reporting.   During the quarter ended March 27, 2010, we completed the acquisition of a U.S. animal health business with approximate aggregate annual revenues of $600.0 million. This acquisition utilizes separate information and financial accounting systems into which we are in the process of integrating our existing animal health business which has approximate aggregate annual revenues of $240.0 million. In addition, we completed two U.S. medical business acquisitions with aggregate annual revenues of $27.0 million. Finally, integration activities were completed during the quarter ended March 27, 2010 for North American and international dental and medical businesses with approximate aggregate annual revenues of $126.0 million.   All acquisitions and integrations involve necessary and appropriate change-management controls that are considered in our annual assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.    Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control   A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.            38      Table of Contents    PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical, medical devices and other healthcare products. As a business practice, we generally obtain product liability indemnification from our suppliers.   We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks in amounts that we consider adequate. In many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others, the manufacturer provides us with indemnification. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection. In our opinion, all pending matters are covered by insurance or will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.   As of March 27, 2010, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to product liability and other claims that were probable to result in a liability and for which we were able to reasonably estimate a loss. This accrued amount, as well as related expenses, was not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our method for determining estimated losses considers currently available facts, presently enacted laws and regulations and other external factors, including probable recoveries from third parties.     ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
