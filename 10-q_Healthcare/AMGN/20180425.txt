Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in this footnote; and in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.Our legal proceedings involve various aspects of our business and a variety of claims—including but not limited to patent validity and infringement, regulatory standards, and other matters—some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. In each of the matters described in this filing or in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, plaintiffs seek an award of a not-yet-quantified amount of damages or an amount that is not material. In addition, a number of the matters pending against us are at very early stages of the legal process, which in complex proceedings of the sort we face often extend for several years. As a result, none of the matters pending against us described in this filing or in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, have progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or the development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate a range of possible loss, if any, or such amounts are not material. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these matters, an adverse determination in one or more of these matters currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings and other matters are discussed below:PCSK9 Antibody Patent LitigationU.S. Patent Litigation—Sanofi/RegeneronThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Federal Circuit Court) denied Amgen’s petition for rehearing en banc and issued a March 2, 2018 mandate, returning the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the Delaware District Court) for a new trial on two of the defendants’ challenges to the validity of our patents (lack of written description and enablement of the claimed inventions) and for further consideration of a permanent injunction. Trial has been set to begin on February 19, 2019.Sensipar® (cinacalcet) LitigationSensipar® Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) Patent LitigationDuring February 2018, the separate lawsuits filed by Amgen in December 2017 for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 9,375,405 (the ’405 Patent) against (1) Watson Laboratories, Inc. and Actavis Pharma, Inc., (2) Teva Pharmaceuticals, USA, Inc., and (3) Barr Laboratories, Inc. were each dismissed by agreement between Amgen and the respective defendants.On March 5, 2018, the Delaware District Court commenced trial on the infringement claims and defenses in the Amgen Inc. v. Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. et al. consolidated lawsuit. The Delaware District Court has scheduled post-trial briefing on this portion of the trial for May 2018, but has not yet scheduled trial on defendants’ challenges to the validity of the ’405 Patent.During March and April 2018, the Delaware District Court signed consent judgments filed by Amgen and each of (1) Cipla Limited and Cipla USA, Inc., (2) Strides Pharma Global Pte. Limited and Strides Pharma, Inc., (3) Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. and Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc., and (4) Macleods Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. (defendants in the second consolidated lawsuit, Amgen Inc. v. Alkem at al.). In each of these four consent judgments, the parties stipulated to an entry of judgment of infringement and validity of the ’405 Patent and an injunction prohibiting the manufacture, use, sale, offer to sell, importation of, or distribution into the United States of the applicable defendants’ cinacalcet product during the term of the ’405 Patent unless specifically authorized pursuant to the confidential settlement agreement. In March and April 2018, the Delaware District Court also entered orders dismissing the following defendants on stipulations between Amgen and each of (1) Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc., (2) Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc., and (3) Lupin Ltd. and Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (also defendants in the second consolidated lawsuit) subject to terms of confidential settlement agreements.25Sensipar® Pediatric Exclusivity LitigationOn February 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (the D.C. District Court) entered a final judgment for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). On February 19, 2018, Amgen filed its notice of appeal of the final judgment. Amgen also filed with the D.C. District Court an emergency motion for injunctive relief pending appeal, which was denied on February 22. On February 23, 2018, Amgen filed an emergency motion for injunction pending appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the D.C. Circuit Court). On March 2, 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court denied the motion for an injunction pending appeal. Briefing on Amgen’s appeal has been completed and oral arguments are scheduled for May 17, 2018.KYPROLIS® (carfilzomib) ANDA Patent LitigationAs previously disclosed, the Delaware District Court consolidated for purposes of discovery a number of patent infringement lawsuits filed by our subsidiary Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. (Onyx Therapeutics) into Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. v. Cipla Limited, et al. On February 7, 2018, the Delaware District Court also consolidated for purposes of discovery the lawsuit against Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. into Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. v. Cipla Limited, et al. On February 14, 2018, by joint stipulation of the parties, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. was dismissed from the applicable lawsuit filed in the Delaware District Court in April 2017. On March 20, 2018, the Delaware District Court entered a stipulation between the parties providing Aurobindo a covenant not to sue on our U.S. Patent Nos. 7,232,818 (the ’818 Patent); 7,491,704 (the ’704 Patent); 8,129,346 (the ’346 Patent); and 8,207,297 (the ’297 Patent).On February 15, 2018, Onyx Therapeutics filed a lawsuit in the Delaware District Court against Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Breckenridge) for patent infringement, and subsequently amended the complaint on March 9, 2018 to assert infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,417,042 (the ’042 Patent); 7,737,112 (the ’112 Patent); 8,207,125 (the ’125 Patent); 8,207,126 (the ’126 Patent); and 8,207,127 (the ’127 Patent). On April 11, 2018, Breckenridge filed a response to the complaint alleging invalidity and, in certain instances, non-infringement of the patents. On April 20, 2018, Onyx Therapeutics filed a lawsuit in the Delaware District Court against Cipla Limited and Cipla USA, Inc. for patent infringement of the ’042, ’112, ’125, ’126 and ’127 Patents. In each new lawsuit, Onyx Therapeutics seeks an order of the Delaware District Court making any FDA approval of the respective defendant’s Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) effective no earlier than the expiration of the applicable patents. As previously disclosed, Onyx Therapeutics filed lawsuits in the Delaware District Court against Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, Dr. Reddy’s), against Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex), and against Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sagent) for infringement of a number of our patents. Each of these defendants responded by filing defenses of invalidity and, in certain instances, non-infringement of the patents. During April 2018, the Delaware District Court entered orders on stipulations between Onyx Therapeutics and each of Apotex, Dr. Reddy’s and Sagent, respectively, that each defendant infringes the ’042, ’112, ’125, ’126, and ’127 Patents, and that Onyx Therapeutics will not assert patent infringement of the ’818, ’704, ’346, and ’297 Patents against certain of the respective defendants’ ANDA applications and products. NEUPOGEN® (filgrastim)/ Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) LitigationAdello NEUPOGEN® Patent LitigationOn March 8, 2018, Amgen Inc. and Amgen Manufacturing Ltd., (collectively, Amgen), filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the New Jersey District Court) against Adello Biologics, LLC (Adello). This lawsuit stems from Adello’s submission of an application for FDA licensure of a filgrastim product as biosimilar to Amgen’s NEUPOGEN®. Amgen has asserted infringement of 17 our patents. Amgen seeks an injunction to prohibit Adello from commercializing its biosimilar filgrastim product in the United States prior to the expiry of these patents.Apotex NEUPOGEN®/Neulasta® Patent LitigationAs previously disclosed, on February 17, 2017, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Apotex’s petition to institute an inter partes review (IPR) of our U.S. Patent No. 8,952,138 (the ’138 Patent), challenging claims of the ’138 Patent as unpatentable. On February 15, 2018, the PTAB issued a final decision on the IPR of the ’138 Patent holding all but one claim of the ’138 Patent as unpatentable. On March 16, 2018, Apotex filed a request for rehearing on the PTAB’s finding that this one claim is patentable. Coherus Neulasta® Patent LitigationOn April 18, 2018, the Delaware District Court entered final judgment dismissing Amgen’s complaint for infringement of our patent, having previously granted Coherus BioSciences, Inc.’s (Coherus) motion to dismiss.26Mylan Neulasta® Patent LitigationOn April 6, 2018, Mylan Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc., Mylan GmbH and Mylan N.V. filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings of non-infringement of U.S. Patent No. 8,273,707.ENBREL (etanercept) LitigationSandoz ENBREL Patent LitigationThe New Jersey District Court has rescheduled trial to start on September 11, 2018.Coherus ENBREL Patent ChallengeOn March 9, 2018, the PTAB denied Coherus’ petitions to institute IPR trial proceedings on U.S. Patent No. 8,063,182 and U.S. Patent No. 8,163,522, which relate to ENBREL and are exclusively licensed to our subsidiary Immunex Corporation by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. On April 9, 2018, Coherus filed requests for rehearing on these two denied petitions.MVASI™ (bevacizumab-awwb) Patent LitigationOn April 17, 2018, the Delaware District Court granted Amgen’s motion to dismiss certain claims by Genentech Inc. and City of Hope that Amgen had not complied with the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act. Trial is scheduled to start June 1, 2020.27Item 2.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business.

For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.Products/Pipeline CardiovascularRepatha® •In March 2018, we announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion to include a new indication in the Repatha® label for adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The recommended label recognizes the findings from the Repatha® cardiovascular outcomes study, FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular OUtcomes Research with Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk).28Oncology/HematologyBLINCYTO® •In March 2018, we announced that the FDA approved under accelerated approval the supplemental Biologics License Application for BLINCYTO® for the treatment of adults and children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease greater than or equal to 0.1 percent.Neulasta® •In February 2018, we announced that the CHMP of the EMA issued a positive opinion recommending a label variation for Neulasta® to include the Neulasta® Onpro® kit.Bone HealthXGEVA® •In April 2018, we announced that the European Commission approved an expanded indication for XGEVA® for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma.BiosimilarsKANJINTI™* (formerly ABP 980)•In March 2018, we announced that the CHMP of the EMA adopted a positive opinion for the Marketing Authorization Application of KANJINTI™, a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin® (trastuzumab). KANJINTI™ has been recommended for approval for the treatment of the same three types of cancer as Herceptin® is approved for in the European Union, including HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, HER2-positive early breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction. KANJINTI™ is being developed in collaboration with Allergan plc.Next-generation biomanufacturing•In April 2018, we announced plans to build a new next-generation biomanufacturing plant on our campus in West Greenwich, Rhode Island. The new plant will employ our next-generation biomanufacturing capabilities and manufacture products for the U.S. and global markets.* FDA conditionally approved trade nameSelected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data): Three months endedMarch 31,   2018 2017 ChangeProduct sales     U.S.$4,147 $4,095 1 %ROW1,196 1,104 8 %Total product sales5,343 5,199 3 %Other revenues211 265 (20)%Total revenues$5,554 $5,464 2 %Operating expenses$2,828 $2,873 (2)%Operating income$2,726 $2,591 5 %Net income$2,311 $2,071 12 %Diluted EPS$3.25 $2.79 16 %Diluted shares711 741 (4)%In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers (such as physicians or their clinics), dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.Total product sales increased for the three months ended March 31, 2018, driven primarily by higher unit demand. 29Other revenues decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2018, driven primarily by lower milestone payments received, offset partially by higher Ibrance® (palbociclib) royalty income.Operating expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2018, driven primarily by lower royalties and lower amortization of intangible assets, offset partially by higher investments in product launches and marketed product support. All expense categories benefited from our continued transformation and process improvement efforts. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2018 2017 ChangeNeulasta®$1,155 $1,210 (5)%ENBREL1,105 1,181 (6)%Sensipar®/Mimpara®497 421 18 %Prolia® 494 425 16 %Aranesp®454 511 (11)%XGEVA® 445 402 11 %EPOGEN®244 270 (10)%Other products949 779 22 %Total product sales$5,343 $5,199 3 %Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed below and in the following sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017: (i) Overview, Item 1.

As of March 31, 2018, utilization of the Neulasta® Onpro® kit, as a percentage of Neulasta® sales in the United States, continues to grow.Our final material U.S. patent for Neulasta® expired in October 2015. Therefore, we expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Neulasta®. Multiple companies have announced applications to the FDA for proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta®. A number of these companies have announced receipt of Complete Response Letters from the FDA regarding their applications, and certain ones may receive approval in 2018. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigations with these and other companies that are developing proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta®, see Note 14, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 18, 30Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.In addition, supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, that are related to our European patent for Neulasta® expired in August 2017.Neulasta® sales have been and will continue to be affected by the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new treatment alternatives that have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of myelosuppressive regimens in some patients.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2018 2017 Change ENBREL — U.S.$1,050 $1,118 (6)%ENBREL — Canada55 63 (13)%Total ENBREL$1,105 $1,181 (6)%The decrease in ENBREL sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was driven primarily by lower unit demand and, to a lesser extent, a decline in net selling price and favorable prior-period changes in accounting estimates, offset partially by an increase in inventory.For 2018, we expect the trend of lower unit demand to continue. In addition, we expect 2018 net selling price to decline slightly compared to 2017.Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2018 2017 ChangeSensipar® — U.S.$409 $337 21%Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW88 84 5%Total Sensipar®/Mimpara®$497 $421 18%The increase in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was driven primarily by higher unit demand. There was a shift in reimbursement from U.S. Medicare Part D to Part B at the beginning of 2018, and providers may have ordered additional supply in order to ensure patient treatment was not interrupted.Our U.S. composition of matter patent related to Sensipar®, a small molecule, expired in March 2018. We are also involved in a number of litigation matters related to Sensipar®, including patent litigations with a number of companies seeking to market generic versions of Sensipar® and litigation regarding our request for pediatric exclusivity for Sensipar®. See Note 14, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.31Prolia® Total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2018 2017 ChangeProlia® — U.S.$320 $279 15%Prolia® — ROW174 146 19%Total Prolia®$494 $425 16%The increase in global Prolia® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was driven primarily by higher unit demand.

For 2018, we expect Aranesp® to face increasing competition from long-acting products. We could also face competition from biosimilar versions of EPOGEN® in 2018 if they launch in the United States.XGEVA®  Total XGEVA® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2018 2017 ChangeXGEVA® — U.S.$332 $298 11%XGEVA® — ROW113 104 9%Total XGEVA®$445 $402 11%The increase in global XGEVA® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was driven primarily by higher unit demand.EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2018 2017 ChangeEPOGEN® — U.S.$244 $270 (10)%The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was driven primarily by a decrease in net selling price due to contractual terms negotiated with DaVita Inc., and lower unit demand.32 Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN® expired in May 2015. We face competition in the United States, which has had, and will continue to have, a material adverse impact on sales of EPOGEN®. Multiple companies are developing proposed biosimilar versions of EPOGEN®, and certain ones may receive approval in 2018. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigation with one of these companies, see Note 14, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2018 2017 ChangeKYPROLIS®— U.S.$137 $137 — %KYPROLIS®— ROW85 53 60 %Nplate®— U.S.112 97 15 %Nplate®— ROW67 57 18 %Vectibix®— U.S.75 61 23 %Vectibix®— ROW94 86 9 %Repatha®— U.S.84 33 *Repatha®— ROW39 16 *NEUPOGEN®— U.S.65 101 (36)%NEUPOGEN®— ROW38 47 (19)%BLINCYTO® — U.S.30 23 30 %BLINCYTO® — ROW19 11 73 %ParsabivTM — U.S.36 — *ParsabivTM — ROW5 — *Other — U.S.19 15 27 %Other — ROW44 42 5 %Total other products$949 $779 22 %Total U.S. — other products$558 $467 19 %Total ROW — other products391 312 25 %Total other products$949 $779 22 %* Change in excess of 100%.33Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2018 2017 Change Operating expenses:     Cost of sales$944 $996 (5)%% of product sales17.7% 19.2%  % of total revenues17.0% 18.2%  Research and development$760 $769 (1)%% of product sales14.2% 14.8%  % of total revenues13.7% 14.1%  Selling, general and administrative$1,127 $1,064 6 %% of product sales21.1% 20.5%  % of total revenues20.3% 19.5%  Other$(3) $44 ** Change in excess of 100%.Transformation and process improvementsDuring 2014, we announced transformation and process improvement efforts that we continue to execute. As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders.The transformation includes a restructuring plan that we continue to estimate will result in pretax accounting charges in the range of $825 million to $900 million. As of March 31, 2018, restructuring costs incurred to date were $801 million. The charges that were recorded related to the restructuring during the three months ended March 31, 2018, were not significant. Since 2014, we have realized approximately $1.6 billion of transformation and process improvement savings. Net savings have not been significant as savings were reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 17.0% of total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, driven primarily by lower royalties and lower amortization of intangible assets, offset partially by higher manufacturing costs. Research and developmentR&D expenses, including Discovery Research and Translational Sciences, later-stage clinical programs and marketed products, were flat for the three months ended March 31, 2018.Selling, general and administrativeThe increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was driven primarily by investments in product launches and marketed product support. OtherOther operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, included certain net charges related to our restructuring plan and the change in fair values of contingent consideration relating to prior-year business combinations. 34Nonoperating expense/income and income taxesNonoperating expense/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31, 2018 2017Interest expense, net$338 $326Interest and other income, net$231 $195Provision for income taxes$308 $389Effective tax rate11.8% 15.8%Interest expense, netThe increase in Interest expense, net, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was due primarily to the impact of increasing interest rates on variable-rate debt and a higher average amount of debt outstanding.Interest and other income, netThe increase in Interest and other income, net, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was due primarily to a net gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of K-A (see Note 3, Business combinations, to the condensed consolidated financial statements) and higher interest income earned as a result of higher average investment balances, offset partially by net investment losses recognized in liquidating a portion of our portfolio, in part to fund a tender offer to repurchase our common stock.Income taxes The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was due primarily to the impacts of U.S. tax reform, including the reduction in the U.S. statutory tax rate, offset partially by U.S. tax on foreign earnings.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the 2017 Tax Act, which imposes a repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, implements a territorial tax system together with a current tax on certain foreign earnings and lowers the general corporate income tax rate to 21%. In March 2018, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to incorporate SAB 118, which permits us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We continue to analyze the 2017 Tax Act, and in certain areas, have made reasonable estimates of the effects on our condensed consolidated financial statements and tax disclosures.The 2017 Tax Act includes U.S. taxation on foreign intangible income, effective January 1, 2018. The FASB allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as foreign intangible income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to the foreign intangible income as a period expense in the year it is incurred. We have recorded no provisional amount for deferred taxes on the foreign intangible income because more time is needed to analyze the data in order to make an accounting policy election.We consider our key estimates on the repatriation tax, the net deferred tax remeasurement, the impact on our unrealized tax benefits and the accounting policy election on temporary basis differences related to the foreign intangible income to be incomplete due to our continuing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We are still accumulating and processing data to update our underlying calculations and we expect the U.S. Treasury and regulators may issue further guidance, among other things, therefore our estimates may change during 2018. However, we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period.As previously disclosed, we received an RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. On November 29, 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRS calculations but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution through the IRS administrative appeals process, which we believe will likely not be concluded within the next 12 months. Final resolution of the IRS audit could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows if not resolved favorably, however, we believe our income tax reserves are appropriately provided for all open tax years. See Note 5, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.35Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$32,172 $41,678Total assets$71,164 $79,954Current portion of long-term debt$2,183 $1,152Long-term debt$33,358 $34,190Stockholders’ equity$15,620 $25,241Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesWe have global access to our $32 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as we no longer reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely outside the United States. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we owe a repatriation tax on undistributed earnings generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions estimated at $7.3 billion that will be paid over eight years. The first annual payment was made in April 2018.The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Capital allocationConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we seek to deploy our accumulated cash balances in an efficient manner and consider several alternatives such as share repurchases, payment of cash dividends, repayment of debt and strategic transactions that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest. We intend to continue to invest in our business and return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.In March 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.32 per share of common stock, which will be paid on June 8, 2018. In December 2017, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.32 per share of common stock, which was paid on March 8, 2018.We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased $10.8 billion of our stock and paid $10.7 billion in cash during the period, which included 52.1 million shares of common stock repurchased through a $10.0 billion tender offer. As of March 31, 2018, $3.6 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program. In April 2018, our Board of Directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by an additional $5.0 billion.As a result of stock repurchases, including our recent tender offer, and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Our accumulated deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.36Certain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant, which was modified during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The modified covenant requires that we maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of: (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA), to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the amended credit agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of March 31, 2018.Cash flowsOur summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): Three months endedMarch 31, 2018 2017Net cash provided by operating activities$2,727 $2,385Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$14,906 $(157)Net cash used in financing activities$(11,692) $(2,111)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased compared with the same period in the prior year due primarily to higher net income and higher accruals for sales incentives and allowances, offset partially by the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors.InvestingCash provided by investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2018, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $14.9 billion. Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017, was due primarily to capital expenditures of $168 million, offset partially by net activity related to marketable securities of $63 million. Capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, were associated primarily with manufacturing-capacity expansions in various locations, as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2018 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $750 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2018, was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $10.7 billion and payment of dividends of $951 million. Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $847 million, a debt repayment of $605 million and repurchases of our common stock of $586 million. See Note 11, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, under different assumptions or conditions, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2018.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and is incorporated herein by reference. There have been no material changes during the three months ended March 31, 2018, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.37Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2018.Management determined that, as of March 31, 2018, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.38PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 14, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.There are no material updates from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program, under which the repurchase activity was as follows: Total numberof sharespurchased Averageprice paidper share Total numberof shares purchasedas part of publicly announced program Maximum dollarvalue that mayyet be purchasedunder the program(1)January 1 - 311,242,000 $185.75 1,242,000 $14,139,104,402February 1 - 28542,890 $188.11 542,890 $14,036,979,617March 1 - 3154,616,133 $191.42 54,616,133 $3,582,419,801 56,401,023 $191.26 56,401,023  (1)In January 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of $10.0 billion available under our stock repurchase program.
