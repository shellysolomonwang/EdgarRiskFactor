Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.) We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in this Note; in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016; and in Note 12, Contingencies and commitments to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017.We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.Our legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to a class action with thousands of putative class members. These legal proceedings, as well as other matters, involve various aspects of our business and a variety of claims—including but not limited to patent infringement, marketing, pricing and trade practices—some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. In each of the matters described in this filing, in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, or in Note 12, Contingencies and commitments to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017, plaintiffs seek an award of a not-yet-quantified amount of damages or an amount that is not material. In addition, a number of the matters pending against us are at very early stages of the legal process (which in complex proceedings of the sort faced by us often extend for several years). As a result, none of the matters pending against us described in this filing, in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, or in Note 12, Contingencies and commitments to the condensed consolidated financial 23statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017, have progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate a range of possible loss, if any, or such amounts are not material. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these matters, an adverse determination in one or more of these matters currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings and other matters are discussed below:PCSK9 Antibody Patent LitigationU.S. Patent Litigation—Sanofi/RegeneronOn June 6, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Federal Circuit Court) heard argument on the appeal by defendants Sanofi, Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, Aventisub LLC, formerly doing business as Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) of the judgment of the U.S. District Court for Delaware (the Delaware District Court), which had found that the patents in suit are valid and infringed by the defendants and the permanent injunction granted by the Delaware District Court prohibiting the infringing manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or import of alirocumab in the United States.Patent Disputes in the European RegionOn May 2, 2017, Amgen filed its response to five oppositions seeking to invalidate European Patent No. 2,215,124 granted to Amgen by the European Patent Office and filed by each of Sanofi, Eli Lilly and Company, Regeneron, and Strawman Ltd., and a joint opposition filed by Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Sanofi-Aventis Groupe S.A. and Sanofi Winthrop Industrie S.A.Sensipar® (cinacalcet) Patent LitigationOn April 6, 2017, the Delaware District Court consolidated Amgen’s lawsuit against Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. and Cadila Healthcare Ltd. with 13 lawsuits previously consolidated that were filed by Amgen against defendants for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 9,375,405 (the ‘405 Patent). These lawsuits are based on defendants’ separate Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) that seek approval to market generic versions of Sensipar® before expiration of the asserted patent. The Delaware District Court issued a claim construction ruling on July 19, 2017.  Amgen filed an additional four lawsuits that have not been consolidated in the Delaware District Court for infringement of the ‘405 Patent against: (1) Piramal Healthcare UK Limited (Piramal) on June 9, 2017; (2) Alkem Laboratories Ltd. on June 23, 2017; (3) Lupin Ltd. and Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Lupin) on June 23, 2017; and (4) Macleods Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. (MacLeods) on June 23, 2017. Responses seeking a declaration of non-infringement and invalidity of the ‘405 Patent were filed by Piramal on June 30, 2017, MacLeods on July 17, 2017, and Lupin on July 19, 2017. MacLeod’s response included a counterclaim alleging sham litigation in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. KYPROLIS® (carfilzomib) Patent LitigationOn April 18 and July 3, 2017, the Delaware District Court consolidated for purposes of discovery ten previously-disclosed lawsuits filed by Amgen against defendants for infringement of certain of our patents into a single case. These lawsuits are based on defendants’ separate ANDAs that seek approval to market generic versions of KYPROLIS® before expiration of the asserted patent or patents. Responses to Amgen’s complaints have been filed by defendants in all lawsuits alleging invalidity and, in certain instances, non-infringement of our patents. A claim construction hearing has been scheduled for March 26, 2018 and trial is scheduled to commence on March 11, 2019. Other Biosimilars Patent LitigationsWe have filed a number of lawsuits against manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products. In each case, our complaint alleges that the manufacturer’s actions infringe certain patents we hold and may also allege that the manufacturer has failed to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA).Sandoz Filgrastim LitigationOn June 12, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit Court ruling that a biosimilar applicant must wait to give the 180-day advance notice of first commercial marketing until after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has licensed the biosimilar product, holding that such notice can be given either before or after the FDA approval. On a second issue, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the Federal Circuit Court’s decision that the only remedy available when a biosimilar applicant refuses to provide its Biologics License Application is to bring a patent infringement claim. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the Federal Circuit Court that there is no remedy under federal law for failing to make the disclosure but remanded the case to the 24Federal Circuit Court to determine whether California law would treat noncompliance with such requirement as unlawful and, if so, to determine whether the BPCIA pre-empts any additional remedy available under state law and whether Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz) forfeited any pre-emption defense. On June 29, 2017, Sandoz filed a request of the Federal Circuit Court to remand the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to allow that court to address the questions of California law.Apotex Pegfilgrastim/Filgrastim LitigationOn May 22, 2017, Amgen filed its response to the previously-disclosed inter partes review of our U.S. Patent Nos. 8,952,138 instituted by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in response to Apotex’s petition. Oral argument on the inter partes review, if requested, is scheduled for December 13, 2017. Hospira Epoetin Alfa LitigationOn May 12, 2017, Hospira, Inc. (Hospira) filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the patents-in-suit and, on June 28, 2017, the Delaware District Court heard arguments on this motion. This lawsuit stems from the submission by Hospira under the BPCIA of an application for FDA licensure of an epoetin product as biosimilar to Amgen’s EPOGEN® (epoetin alfa). Trial is scheduled to commence on September 18, 2017.Coherus Pegfilgrastim Litigation On May 10, 2017, Amgen filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Delaware against Coherus BioSciences, Inc. (Coherus) for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 8,273,707 (the ‘707 Patent). This lawsuit stems from Coherus’ submission of an application for FDA licensure of a pegfilgrastim product as biosimilar to Amgen’s Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) under the BPCIA. By its complaint, Amgen seeks, among other remedies, an injunction prohibiting Coherus from infringing the ‘707 Patent. On June 1, 2017, Coherus filed a motion to dismiss the complaint as purportedly failing to state a claim of patent infringement.State Derivative LitigationOn June 2, 2017, plaintiffs in the consolidated state stockholder derivative cases (now captioned Andersen v. Sharer, et. al) filed a third amended complaint with the Ventura County Superior Court, adding Robert A. Bradway, François de Carbonnel, Vance D. Coffman, Robert A. Eckert, Rebecca M. Henderson, Tyler Jacks, and Ronald D. Sugar as defendants (together with the previously-disclosed defendants, the State Defendants) and removing Chris Larson as a plaintiff. The third amended complaint alleges that the State Defendants breached their fiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets, were unjustly enriched and violated the California Corporations Code. Plaintiffs allege that the State Defendants failed to disclose and/or misrepresented results of Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa) clinical studies, marketed both Aranesp® and EPOGEN® for off-label uses and that these actions or inactions caused stockholders to suffer damages. The complaint also alleges insider trading by the State Defendants and that Amgen engaged in improper marketing with respect to Enbrel®(eternacept), Vectibix®(panitumumab), Sensipar®, and XGEVA®(denosumab). The plaintiffs seek treble damages based on various causes of action, reformed corporate governance, equitable and/or injunctive relief, restitution, disgorgement of profits, benefits and other compensation and legal costs.ERISA LitigationAs previously disclosed, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final order approving the settlement of this class action lawsuit on April 5, 2017. On May 4, 2017, plaintiff Don Hanks filed an appeal of the settlement with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.Pediatric Exclusivity LitigationOn May 25, 2017, Amgen filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking effectively to reverse the FDA’s May 22, 2017 rejection of Amgen’s request for pediatric exclusivity for cinacalcet hydrochloride (Sensipar®/Mimpara®). On June 5, 2017, this litigation was stayed through early August 2017 pending additional review by the FDA of Amgen’s request for pediatric exclusivity.25Item 2.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with GAAP. Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.Forward-looking statementsThis report and other documents we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions.

For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017.Products/PipelineBone HealthEVENITY™ (romosozumab)*•In May 2017, we and UCB, our global collaboration partner in the development of EVENITY™, announced that the EVENITY™ ARCH (Active-contRolled FraCture Study in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis at High Risk of Fracture) study met both primary endpoints and the key secondary endpoint. An imbalance in positively adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was observed as a new safety signal.•In July 2017, we and UCB announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the Biologics License Application (BLA) for EVENITY™ as a treatment for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The resubmission will include data from the Phase 3 ARCH study and the Phase 3 BRIDGE (placeBo-contRolled study evaluatIng the efficacy anD safety of romosozumab in treatinG mEn with osteoporosis) study evaluating EVENITY™ in men with osteoporosis, in addition to the Phase 3 FRAME (FRActure study in postmenopausal woMen with ostEoporosis) study. We do not expect approval of EVENITY™ in the United States to occur in 2017.XGEVA® •In June 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted the XGEVA® supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) that seeks to expand the current approved indication for the prevention of fractures and other skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors to include patients with multiple myeloma. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of February 3, 2018.CardiovascularRepatha® •In June 2017, we announced the submission of a sBLA to the FDA and a variation to the marketing authorization to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Repatha®. The regulatory submissions are based on the Repatha® cardiovascular outcomes study (Further Cardiovascular OUtcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk).NeuroscienceAimovig™*•In July 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for review the BLA for Aimovig™ for the prevention of migraine in patients experiencing four or more migraine days per month. The FDA has set a PDUFA target action date of May 17, 2018. Aimovig™ is being developed and commercialized jointly with Novartis.Oncology/HematologyBLINCYTO® •In July 2017, we announced that the FDA approved the sBLA for BLINCYTO® to include overall survival data from the Phase 3 TOWER study. The approval converts BLINCYTO®’s accelerated approval to a full approval. The approval expands the indication of BLINCYTO® for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults and children.KYPROLIS® •In July 2017, we announced positive results from the final analysis of the Phase 3 ASPIRE (CArfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and DexamethaSone versus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for the treatment of PatIents with Relapsed Multiple MyEloma) study. The study met the key secondary endpoint of overall survival, demonstrating that KYPROLIS®, lenalidomide and dexamethasone reduced the risk of death by 21% over lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone.•In July 2017, we announced the submission of a supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA and a variation to the marketing application to the EMA to include overall survival data from the Phase 3 head-to-head ENDEAVOR (RandomizEd, OpeN Label, Phase 3 Study of Carfilzomib Plus DExamethAsone Vs Bortezomib Plus DexamethasOne in Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma) study in the product label for KYPROLIS®.27Vectibix® •In June 2017, we announced that the FDA approved a label update for Vectibix® to more precisely molecularly define patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer, as first-line therapy in combination with FOLFOX and as monotherapy following disease progression after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy.  BiosimilarsABP 215•In July 2017, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted unanimously to recommend approval of ABP 215, a biosimilar candidate to Avastin® (bevacizumab). The FDA is not bound by the Committee’s recommendation but does take its advice into consideration when considering the approval of a new therapeutic. The FDA has set a Biosimilar User Fee Act target action date of September 14, 2017. ABP 215 is being developed in collaboration with Allergan plc. Next-Generation Biomanufacturing•In May 2017, our Next-Generation Biomanufacturing plant in Singapore was approved by the FDA for commercial production of denosumab drug substance. *FDA provisionally approved trade nameSelected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (dollar and share amounts in millions, except per share data): Three months endedJune 30,   Six months endedJune 30,   2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 ChangeProduct sales:           U.S.$4,386 $4,317 2 % $8,481 $8,436 1 %Rest of the world (ROW)1,188 1,157 3 % 2,292 2,277 1 %Total product sales5,574 5,474 2 % 10,773 10,713 1 %Other revenues236 214 10 % 501 502 — %Total revenues$5,810 $5,688 2 % $11,274 $11,215 1 %Operating expenses$3,112 $3,308 (6)% $5,985 $6,433 (7)%Operating income$2,698 $2,380 13 % $5,289 $4,782 11 %Net income$2,151 $1,870 15 % $4,222 $3,770 12 %Diluted EPS$2.91 $2.47 18 % $5.71 $4.97 15 %Diluted shares738 756 (2)% 740 759 (3)%The increases in global product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, were driven primarily by Prolia®, Sensipar®/Mimpara®, Repatha®, and KYPROLIS®. The increase in other revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017, was driven primarily by higher Ibrance® (palbociclib) royalty income. Other revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2017, were relatively flat, as lower milestone payments received were offset by higher Ibrance® royalty income.Operating expenses decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. All expense categories benefited from our transformation and process improvement efforts. As in prior years, our operating expenses are expected to be higher in the second half of the year driven by the timing of expenses.The increases in net income and diluted EPS for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, were driven primarily by higher operating margins.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016.28Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedJune 30,   Six months endedJune 30,   2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 ChangeENBREL$1,466 $1,484 (1)% $2,647 $2,869 (8)%Neulasta®1,087 1,149 (5)% 2,297 2,332 (2)%Aranesp®535 504 6 % 1,046 1,036 1 %Prolia® 505 441 15 % 930 793 17 %Sensipar®/Mimpara®427 389 10 % 848 756 12 %XGEVA® 395 381 4 % 797 759 5 %EPOGEN®292 331 (12)% 562 631 (11)%Other products867 795 9 % 1,646 1,537 7 %Total product sales$5,574 $5,474 2 % $10,773 $10,713 1 %Future sales of our products are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others.

As of June 30, 2017, utilization of the Neulasta® Onpro® kit continued to grow in the United States.29We expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Neulasta®. Multiple companies have announced applications to the FDA for proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta®. Two of these companies have received Complete Response Letters from the FDA regarding their applications.Future Neulasta® sales will also depend in part on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedJune 30,   Six months endedJune 30,   2017 2016 Change  2017 2016 ChangeAranesp® — U.S.$288 $260 11% $566 $521 9 %Aranesp® — ROW247 244 1% 480 515 (7)%Total Aranesp®$535 $504 6% $1,046 $1,036 1 %The increase in global Aranesp® sales for the three months ended June 30, 2017, was driven primarily by higher unit demand.

As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders.The transformation includes a restructuring plan that will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $800 million to $900 million. As of June 30, 2017, restructuring costs incurred to date were $760 million. The charges that were recorded related to the restructuring during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, were not significant. Since 2014, we have realized approximately $1.3 billion of transformation and process improvement savings. Net savings have not been significant as savings were reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 17.6% of total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017, driven primarily by lower royalties. Cost of sales decreased to 17.9% of total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2017, driven primarily by manufacturing efficiencies and lower royalties, offset partially by product mix. The excise tax imposed by the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico excise tax) is recorded as a cost of sales expense. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 16.0% and 16.3% of total revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared with 16.7% and 16.8% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe decrease in R&D expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017, was driven primarily by lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs. The costs associated with our later-stage clinical programs decreased by $31 million. The costs associated with Discovery Research and Translational Sciences (DRTS) and marketed products were relatively unchanged. The decrease in R&D expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017, was driven primarily by lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs and a payment related to a third-party collaboration agreement in the prior year period. The costs associated with later-stage clinical programs and marketed products decreased by $71 million and $58 million, respectively. DRTS spend was relatively unchanged.32Selling, general and administrativeThe decrease in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017, was driven primarily by the expiration of ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016, offset partially by investments in product launches. The decrease in SG&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017, was driven primarily by the expiration of ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016, as well as a charge related to an acquisition in the three months ended March 31, 2016, offset partially by investments in product launches. OtherOther operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, included certain charges related to our restructuring plan. Other operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, included legal proceeding charges of $78 million and $105 million, respectively.Non-operating expenses/income and income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedJune 30, Six months endedJune 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016Interest expense, net$321 $313 $647 $607Interest and other income, net$165 $137 $360 $287Provision for income taxes$391 $334 $780 $692Effective tax rate15.4% 15.2% 15.6% 15.5%Interest expense, netThe increase in Interest expense, net, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, was due primarily to a higher average amount of debt outstanding.Interest and other income, netThe increase in Interest and other income, net, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, was due primarily to higher interest income that resulted from higher average investment balances.Income taxes The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2017, was due primarily to a prior year benefit associated with tax incentives and lower tax benefits from share-based compensation payments, offset partially by discrete benefits associated with the effective settlement of certain state and federal tax matters.The increase in our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017, was due primarily to lower tax benefits from share-based compensation payments, offset partially by discrete benefits associated with the effective settlement of certain state and federal tax matters and favorable tax impacts of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, would have been 18.1% and 18.3%, respectively, compared with 18.1% and 18.4%, respectively, for the corresponding period of the prior year.As previously disclosed, on April 12, 2017, we received a RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution through the IRS administrative appeals process, which we believe will likely not be concluded within the next 12 months. Final resolution of the IRS audit could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows if not resolved favorably, however, we believe our income tax reserves are appropriately provided for all open tax years. See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.33Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data were as follows (in millions): June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$39,227 $38,085Total assets$79,587 $77,626Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt$1,459 $4,403Long-term debt$33,603 $30,193Stockholders’ equity$31,722 $29,875We intend to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amounts of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amounts of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. In March 2017 and December 2016, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.15 per share of common stock, which were paid on June 8 and March 8, 2017, respectively. We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we repurchased and paid in cash $1.6 billion of our stock during the period. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased $1.3 billion of our stock and paid $1.2 billion in cash during the period. As of June 30, 2017, $2.5 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we began borrowing under our $2.5 billion commercial paper program and had $960 million outstanding under this program as of the end of the period. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively, U.S. funds) are adequate to continue meeting our U.S. obligations, including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds, for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaling $39.2 billion as of June 30, 2017, approximately $37.4 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of June 30, 2017.34Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Six months endedJune 30, 2017 2016Net cash provided by operating activities$4,711 $4,592Net cash used in investing activities$(1,970) $(5,047)Net cash used in financing activities$(3,353) $(1,059)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2017, increased compared with the same period in the prior year due primarily to an increase in net income offset partially by the timing of payments to taxing authorities and receipts from customers.InvestingCash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2017, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $1.5 billion and capital expenditures of $353 million. Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $4.6 billion and capital expenditures of $344 million. Capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in various locations, as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2017 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2017, was due primarily to payment of dividends of $1.7 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $1.6 billion, and repayment of long-term debt, net of proceeds from issuances, of $920 million, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper of $959 million. Cash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $1.5 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $1.2 billion, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of repayments, of $1.9 billion. See Note 9, Financing arrangements, and Note 10, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2017.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and is incorporated herein by reference. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes during the six months ended June 30, 2017, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsTo achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into additional interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $3.65 billion during the three months ended June 30, 2017. In addition, we had interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $850 million mature during the three months ended June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2017, interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $9.45 billion were outstanding. These interest rate swap 35contracts effectively converted a fixed interest rate coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at June 30, 2017, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $470 million on our interest rate swap contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income in the ensuing year. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive interests were designed to offset.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2017.Management determined that, as of June 30, 2017, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2017 and Note 12, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017, provide additional disclosure for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we manufacture, market and sell our products. Once our products are approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and 36reporting, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions or monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. The sanctions could include the FDA’s or foreign regulatory authorities’ refusals to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delays or suspensions of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, total or partial suspensions of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecutions.Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval have been, and will continue to be, increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. Legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations, change existing laws or regulations, or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. The rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets, and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets. We are unable to predict whether and when any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as changes to regulations governing manufacturer communications concerning drug products and drug product candidates, and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Regulatory authorities may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical endpoint. For example, a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening progression-free survival (PFS). Demonstrating that the product candidate produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patients remain alive. In the cardiovascular setting, a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce LDL-C levels, as elevated LDL-C level has been a surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack and stroke. The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDL-C reduction, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. For example, our initial FDA application for Repatha® sought approval for a broader patient population based on data demonstrating that Repatha® reduced LDL-C levels. However, the FDA ultimately approved Repatha® only for a subset of those patients, citing among other things the absence of positive outcomes data showing that Repatha® prevents cardiovascular events. We subsequently announced that our phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha® to prevent cardiovascular events met its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint and that we submitted applications to the FDA and EMA to incorporate the results of the outcomes study into the respective Repatha® labels. See Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Developments. However, we cannot predict the degree to which the results of this study will be incorporated into the Repatha® labels by regulators. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion or at all may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current labels.Some of our products have been approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, BLINCYTO® received conditional marketing authorization for the treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL from the European Commission in November 2015. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. If we are unable to fulfill the regulators’ requirements that were conditions of a product’s accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators re-evaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the product’s labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market.Safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required to continuously collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In 2012, pharmacovigilance legislation became effective in the EU that enhanced the authority of European regulators to require companies to conduct additional post-approval clinical efficacy and safety studies and increased the requirements on sponsor companies to analyze and evaluate the risk-benefit profiles of their products. Similarly, for our products with approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) (see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Part I, Item 1. Business—Government Regulation—Post-approval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment 37reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drug’s benefits outweigh the risks, and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. The drug delivery devices approved for use in combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety. As such, we are also required to collect and assess device and user complaints regarding our drug delivery devices. Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and conduct inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For example, in July 2017 the FDA reported on its adverse event reporting system that it is evaluating our Neulasta® Onpro® kit. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting, other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours and that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product’s approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:•revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that may result in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate;•requirement of risk management activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;•mandated post-marketing commitments or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;•product recalls of our approved products;•revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types;•increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or•fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies.For example, since 2006, when adverse safety results involving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were observed, ESAs continue to be the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny. Reviews by regulatory authorities of the risk-benefit profile of ESAs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, changes to ESA labeling and usage in both the oncology and nephrology clinical settings.In addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. In some markets, there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provided for such a pathway; while the FDA continues to implement it, questions remain as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products and what information can be included in biosimilar labeling. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future. Delays or uncertainties in the development of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. Further, we cannot predict whether any repeal or reform of the ACA would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars. In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis, and secure “first-to-market” positions, our future biosimilar sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; if significant disruptions or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials.We currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 3831, 2016, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.The operation of our manufacturing facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico is also subject to local economic challenges. Since June 2015, when the Governor of Puerto Rico announced that the government (including certain government entities) was unable to pay its roughly $72 billion in debt, the government’s liquidity position has continued to deteriorate and public reports indicate that the Puerto Rico government is not making certain payments with respect to its obligations. On June 30, 2016, President Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to provide a mechanism for Puerto Rico to restructure its debt, achieve fiscal responsibility, and gain access to capital markets. PROMESA established a federal Financial Oversight and Management Board (Oversight Board) to provide fiscal oversight through the development and approval of fiscal plans and budgets for Puerto Rico and to assist in the debt restructuring. The Oversight Board approved the Puerto Rico government’s revised fiscal plan on March 13, 2017 and, on June 30, 2017, the government’s budget for fiscal year 2018. The establishment of the Oversight Board initially provided for an automatic stay of creditor actions against the Puerto Rico government until February 15, 2017, and subsequently extended the automatic stay until May 1, 2017, to pursue voluntary negotiations with the Puerto Rico government’s creditors. On May 3, 2017, after negotiations with creditors were unsuccessful and the automatic stay expired, the Oversight Board approved and certified the filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico of a voluntary petition under Title III of PROMESA for the government of Puerto Rico, following thereafter with similar filings for certain Puerto Rico government entities. Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to, but not identical to, Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, on January 29, 2017, the Puerto Rico government enacted the Puerto Rico Fiscal Emergency and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which, among other things, declared a state of financial emergency in Puerto Rico until May 1, 2017, and authorizes the Governor to designate certain services as essential services, and other services as non-essential in order to prioritize the use of available resources to satisfy Puerto Rico’s obligations. On July 19, 2017, the Puerto Rico government extended the emergency period through December 31, 2017, and authorized the Governor to further extend the emergency period for six-month terms under certain conditions. While PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability, there is still a risk that Puerto Rico’s economic situation could impact the territorial government’s provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business, create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, and/or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico.Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSDuring the three months ended June 30, 2017, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program and the repurchase activity was as follows: Total numberof sharespurchased Averageprice paidper share Total number ofshares purchasedas part of publicly announced program Maximum dollarvalue that mayyet be purchasedunder the program(1)April 1 - 301,108,267 $162.88 1,108,267 $3,340,028,056May 1 - 311,586,272 $154.47 1,586,272 $3,094,997,845June 1 - 303,515,972 $165.05 3,515,972 $2,514,688,372 6,210,511 $161.96 6,210,511  (1)In October 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase that resulted in a total of $5.0 billion available under the stock repurchase program.Item 6.
