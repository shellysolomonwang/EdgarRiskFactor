Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7 – Product Sales in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   March 31,   2013 2012 Change Neulasta®— U.S.$827 $814 2 %Neulasta®— ROW212 225 (6)%Total Neulasta®1,039 1,039 — %NEUPOGEN®— U.S.242 239 1 %NEUPOGEN®— ROW57 66 (14)%Total NEUPOGEN®299 305 (2)%Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®$1,338 $1,344 — %Global Neulasta® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2013, were in line with the prior year, as an increase in the average net sales price was offset by modest unit declines.The decrease in global NEUPOGEN® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2013, was driven by a decrease in unit demand.Our outstanding material U.S. patents for Filgrastim (NEUPOGEN®) expire in December 2013. We expect to face competition in the United States beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, which may have a material adverse impact over time on sales of NEUPOGEN® and, in turn, Neulasta®. Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) expires in 2015.22ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   March 31,   2013 2012 Change ENBREL — U.S.$974 $878 11%ENBREL — Canada65 60 8%Total ENBREL$1,039 $938 11%The increase in ENBREL sales for the three months ended March 31, 2013, was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price and a favorable change in estimated product returns accruals, offset partially by a slight unit decline and a year-over-year unfavorable change in wholesaler inventory.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   March 31,   2013 2012 Change Aranesp® — U.S.$168 $202 (17)%Aranesp® — ROW300 316 (5)%Total Aranesp®$468 $518 (10)%The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2013, was driven by a decline in units. The decrease in ROW Aranesp® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2013, was due to a decrease in the average net sales price.Sequentially, global Aranesp® sales decreased 4% in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, compared with the quarter ended December 31, 2012, due to a decline in units. Outside the U.S., sales were in line with the prior quarter. In the U.S., segment share remained relatively stable, but overall demand declined sequentially.

Sequentially, sales decreased 9% in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, compared with the quarter ended December 31, 2012, driven by a favorable change in accounting estimates in the prior quarter and, to a lesser extent, lower average net sales prices.23XGEVA® and Prolia®  Total XGEVA® and total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   March 31,   2013 2012 Change XGEVA® — U.S.$178 $139 28%XGEVA® — ROW45 14 *Total XGEVA®223 153 46%Prolia® — U.S.87 54 61%Prolia® — ROW55 34 62%Total Prolia®142 88 61%Total XGEVA®/Prolia®$365 $241 51%* Change in excess of 100%The increases in global XGEVA® and Prolia® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2013 were driven by unit growth reflecting increased segment share.Sequentially, global XGEVA® increased 4% in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, compared with the quarter ended December 31, 2012, due to unit growth. Global Prolia® sales decreased 8% during that same period due to seasonality.Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   March 31,   2013 2012 Change Sensipar® — U.S.$179 $140 28 %Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW85 79 8 %Vectibix® — U.S.27 31 (13)%Vectibix® — ROW60 59 2 %Nplate® — U.S.55 54 2 %Nplate® — ROW41 36 14 %Other — ROW59 15 *Total other products$506 $414 22 %Total U.S. — other products$261 $225 16 %Total ROW — other products245 189 30 %Total other products$506 $414 22 %* Change in excess of 100%24Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   March 31,   2013 2012 Change Cost of sales$744 $750 (1)%% of product sales17.9% 19.2%  Research and development$878 $736 19 %% of product sales21.2% 18.9%  Selling, general and administrative$1,158 $1,079 7 %% of product sales27.9% 27.7%  Other$16 $6 ** Change in excess of 100%Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 17.9% of product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2013, which reflects lower inventory write-offs than the prior year; changes in product mix increased cost of sales as a percentage of product sales, however, manufacturing efficiencies and higher average net sales prices offset those increases. Excluding the impact of the excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico, cost of sales would have been 15.9% and 17.1% of product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe increase in R&D expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2013, was driven primarily by increased costs associated with supporting later-stage clinical programs of $105 million, including AMG 145, and increases in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities of $52 million. These were offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $15 million.Selling, general and administrativeThe increase in SG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2013, was driven primarily by higher ENBREL profit share expenses of $54 million. In addition, the three months ended March 31, 2012, included a favorable change to the estimated U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee of $42 million.Under our ENBREL collaboration agreement, we currently pay Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada attributable to all approved indications for ENBREL on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, we maintain a majority share of ENBREL profits. For the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share were $378 million and $324 million, respectively. After expiration of the co-promotion term on October 31, 2013, we will be required to pay Pfizer residual royalties, which are anticipated to be significantly less than what would be owed based on the terms of the current ENBREL profit share.Non-operating expenses/income and income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended March 31, 2013 2012Interest expense, net$263 $235Interest and other income, net$164 $124(Benefit) provision for income taxes$(91) $182Effective tax rate(6.8)% 13.3%25Interest expense, netThe increase in interest expense, net for the three months ended March 31, 2013, was due primarily to a higher average debt balance.Interest and other income, netThe increase in interest and other income, net for the three months ended March 31, 2013, was due primarily to higher net gains on sales of investments as well as higher interest income as a result of a higher average portfolio balance and higher portfolio investment returns.Income taxesOur effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2013, was (6.8)%, compared with 13.3% for the corresponding period of the prior year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was due primarily to the federal and state tax impacts of settlement of our examination with the IRS related to years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The settlement resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately $185 million. In addition, the rate was further reduced by the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2012. The retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit for 2012 resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately $60 million in addition to the 2013 impact of this credit. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, would have been (0.8)% and 18.5% , respectively. See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$21,271 $24,061Total assets51,640 54,298Current portion of long-term debt7 2,495Long-term debt23,885 24,034Stockholders’ equity19,491 19,060The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, Item 1A. Risk Factors—There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.) During the three months ended March 31, 2013, we repurchased 9.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $771 million at an average price of $85.03 per share. As of March 31, 2013, $1.6 billion remained available under our stock repurchase program, which is expected to cover our share repurchase activity into 2014. In December 2012, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per share of common stock, which was paid on March 7, 2013. In March 2013, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per share of common stock, which will be paid in June 2013.In February 2013, our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes matured/converted, and accordingly, the $2.5 billion principal amount was settled in cash. We also elected to pay the note holders who converted their notes $99 million of cash for the excess conversion value, as allowed under the original terms of the notes, which was offset by our receipt of the same amount of cash from the counterparty to the related convertible note hedge. In addition, on May 1, 2013, warrants to acquire 32 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $104.80 originally sold in connection with the issuance of the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes were exercised resulting in a net cash settlement of $100 million. See Note 7, Financing arrangements, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these transactions.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in each case for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided 26by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to repurchase stock and pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of March 31, 2013, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $416 million, of which $282 million was past due, with the past due receivables primarily in Italy, Spain and Portugal. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of March 31, 2013.Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Three months ended March 31, 2013 2012Net cash provided by operating activities$1,049 $972Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities1,809 (2,346)Net cash used in financing activities(3,585) (1,365)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2013, increased due primarily to the timing and amount of receipts from customers and payments to vendors and taxing authorities.InvestingCash provided by investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2013, was due primarily to net sales of marketable securities of $2.0 billion. Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2012, was due primarily to net purchases of marketable securities of $1.2 billion as well as $969 million used to acquire Micromet, Inc., net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Ireland and Puerto Rico, as well as other site developments, totaled $158 million and $144 million during the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We currently estimate 2013 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2013, was due primarily to the cash settlement of the $2.5 billion principal amount of the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes which matured/converted, repurchases of our common stock of $832 million and the payment of dividends of $353 million.27Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2012, was due primarily to the repurchases of our common stock of $1.4 billion and the payment of dividends of $285 million, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $374 million.See Note 7, Financing arrangements, and Note 8, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2013.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, and is incorporated herein by reference. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes for the three months ended March 31, 2013, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsDuring the three months ended March 31, 2013, to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $2.5 billion. These derivative contracts qualify and have been designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges and effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating rate LIBOR-based coupon over the remaining life of the hedged notes. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at March 31, 2013, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $200 million on our interest rate swap contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the ensuing year.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2013.Management determined that, as of March 31, 2013, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.28PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 11, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. These discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, the primary risks related to our business and periodically update those risks for material developments. These risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.There are no material updates from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSDuring the three months ended March 31, 2013, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program.
