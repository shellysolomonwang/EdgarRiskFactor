Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014.29Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2015 2014 Change  2015 2014 Change ENBREL$1,459 $1,120 30 % $3,923 $3,351 17 %Neulasta®1,267 1,193 6 % 3,559 3,416 4 %EPOGEN®489 518 (6)% 1,514 1,492 1 %Aranesp®493 474 4 % 1,452 1,451 — %XGEVA® 378 318 19 % 1,049 896 17 %Sensipar®/Mimpara®353 273 29 % 1,031 841 23 %Prolia® 320 255 25 % 932 715 30 %NEUPOGEN®284 300 (5)% 786 885 (11)%Other products473 397 19 % 1,369 1,106 24 %Total product sales$5,516 $4,848 14 % $15,615 $14,153 10 %Future sales of our products are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others.

On December 17, 2014, Apotex announced that the FDA accepted for filing its application, under the abbreviated pathway, for pegfilgrastim, a biosimilar version of Neulasta®. Therefore, we may face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on Neulasta® sales. For discussion of ongoing litigation between us and Apotex, see Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2015 2014 Change  2015 2014 Change EPOGEN® — U.S.$489 $518 (6)% $1,514 $1,492 1%The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015, was driven primarily by a decline in units resulting from competition and a shift in dialysis sales to Aranesp® , offset partially by a favorable change in wholesaler inventory and an increase in net selling price.The increase in EPOGEN® sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was driven by an increase in net selling price and wholesaler inventory, offset by a decline in units resulting from competition and a shift in dialysis sales to Aranesp®.Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN® expired in May 2015. We face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on EPOGEN® sales. Currently, in the United States, EPOGEN® and Aranesp® compete with MIRCERA®, which F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. (Roche) began selling in October 2014 and, as of May 2015, licensed commercialization rights in the United States to Galenica Group. MIRCERA® competes with Aranesp® in the nephrology segment only. On December 16, 2014, Hospira submitted a BLA to the FDA for Retacrit™, a proposed biosimilar to EPOGEN®, under the abbreviated pathway. For discussion of ongoing litigation between us and Hospira, see Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2015 2014 Change  2015 2014 Change Aranesp® — U.S.$239 $188 27 % $651 $588 11 %Aranesp® — ROW254 286 (11)% 801 863 (7)%Total Aranesp®$493 $474 4 % $1,452 $1,451 — %The increase in global Aranesp® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015, was driven by higher unit demand, including the shift from EPOGEN® in the United States, offset partially by a decrease in net selling price and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

We continue to estimate that this restructuring plan will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $935 million to $1,035 million, of which $724 million was incurred through September 30, 2015. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred $11 million and $166 million, respectively, of restructuring costs. We expect that most of the remaining estimated costs will be incurred during the remainder of 2015 and in 2016 to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts. Net savings are not expected to be significant in 2015 due to investments in new product launches and external business development.Additional disclosure information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Note 2, Restructuring, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.33Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 18.1% and 19.6% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The decreases were driven by lower royalties, higher net selling prices and manufacturing efficiencies. The nine months ended September 30, 2014, also included a $99-million charge related to the termination of the supply contract with Roche as a result of acquiring the licenses to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim in certain territories effective January 1, 2014. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 16.4% and 17.8% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, compared with 19.5% and 20.1% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe increase in R&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015, was driven by increased costs associated with Discovery Research and Translational Sciences (DRTS) of $40 million and marketed products support of $171 million, offset partially by decreased costs in our later stage clinical programs support of $110 million. The net increase in marketed products and later stage clinical programs was driven by our continued support of Repatha™, which, subsequent to its approval in August 2015, was largely categorized as a marketed product rather than later stage clinical program support. The increase in DRTS was due primarily to up-front milestone payments related to our recently announced collaborations with Xencor, Inc. and Novartis.The decrease in R&D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was driven by decreased costs associated with DRTS of $123 million and later stage clinical programs support of $116 million, offset partially by increased costs associated with marketed products support of $153 million, including Repatha™ and BLINCYTO®. All categories of R&D spend benefited from savings from transformation and process improvement efforts under our restructuring plan. Throughout the remainder of 2015 these savings are expected to be offset partially by investments in support of our launch products as well as reinvestment in DRTS.Selling, general and administrativeThe increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due to increased expenses related to new product launches and ENBREL-related payments, offset partially by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts under our restructuring plan. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 also included a $145 million expense accrual related to the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, as final regulations were issued which accelerated by one year the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation.OtherOther operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, included a $32 million gain for the sale of assets related to our site closures, a decrease to the estimated aggregate fair value of a contingent consideration obligation of $18 million, offset partially by a $28 million charge associated with the write-off of a non-key contract asset acquired in a prior year business combination. The nine months ended September 30, 2015 also included certain charges related to our restructuring and other cost savings initiatives, primarily severance, of $73 million and a legal proceeding charge of $71 million.Other operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, included certain charges related to our restructuring and other cost savings initiatives, primarily severance, of $330 million and $368 million, respectively. Those charges were offset partially by decreases to the estimated aggregate fair value of the contingent consideration obligations of $62 million and $47 million, respectively.Non-operating expenses/income and income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014Interest expense, net$282 $269 $811 $810Interest and other income, net$135 $140 $439 $377Provision for income taxes$329 $93 $926 $435Effective tax rate15.0% 7.0% 15.3% 10.1%34Interest expense, netThe increase in interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2015, was due primarily to a higher average amount of fixed rate debt outstanding offset partially by the paydown of outstanding principal on the Term Loan. Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was substantially unchanged from the prior year period primarily due to a higher average amount of fixed rate debt outstanding offset by the repayment of the Master Repurchase Agreement and accelerated recognition of the related offering costs in the second quarter of 2014 as well as the paydown of principal on the Term Loan. Interest and other income, netInterest and other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2015, was substantially the same as the corresponding period in the prior year as higher interest income as a result of higher average cash balances was offset by higher net losses on sales of interest-bearing securities. The increase in Interest and other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was due primarily to higher interest income as a result of higher average cash balances and higher gains on strategic investments, offset partially by higher net losses on sales of interest-bearing securities.Income taxesThe increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015, was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and lower domestic restructuring costs, offset partially by certain discrete items, including a transfer pricing adjustment recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and lower domestic restructuring costs, offset partially by certain discrete items, including a state tax audit settlement in the three months ended March 31, 2015, and a transfer pricing adjustment recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2015.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, would have been 18.4% and 18.7%, respectively, compared with 12.5% and 15.0% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): September 30, 2015 December 31, 2014Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$31,120 $27,026Total assets$71,869 $69,009Current portion of long-term debt$1,250 $500Long-term debt$30,511 $30,215Stockholders’ equity$27,967 $25,778The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and share repurchases, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. Whether and when we declare dividends and the size of any dividend could be affected by a number of factors. In addition, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors—There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or that we will repurchase stock. In December 2014, March 2015 and July 2015, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.79 per share of common stock, which were paid on March 6, June 5, and September 8, 2015, respectively. In October 2015, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.79 per share of common stock, which will be paid on December 7, 2015.The Company also returns capital to stockholders through its stock repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased $1.7 billion of stock and there were no repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. In October 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an increase that resulted in a total of $5.0 billion available under the stock repurchase program. 35We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $266 million and $223 million, respectively. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary.Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaling $31.1 billion as of September 30, 2015, approximately $30.0 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of September 30, 2015. Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Nine months ended September 30, 2015 2014Net cash provided by operating activities$7,017 $6,110Net cash used in investing activities$(5,314) $(6,126)Net cash used in financing activities$(2,208) $(112)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, benefited from an improvement in our operating margin and the effective termination of foreign currency forward contracts that resulted in receipt of $337 million in cash, offset partially by the timing of payments to vendors and tax authorities as well as receipts from customers, including the impact of $100 million received under a government-funded program in Spain during the prior year period.36InvestingCash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $4.8 billion and capital expenditures of $389 million, offset partially by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $271 million. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2014, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities and restricted investments of $5.3 billion and capital expenditures of $515 million. Capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in various locations, as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2015 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $1.8 billion, repurchases of common stock of $1.7 billion and the settlement of an obligation incurred in the connection with the acquisition of Onyx of $225 million, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments of $1.2 billion. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2014, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $1.4 billion offset partially by proceeds for the issuance of debt, net of repayments of $1.0 billion.See Note 9, Financing arrangements, and Note 10, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and is incorporated herein by reference. There were no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2015.Management determined that, as of September 30, 2015, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.37PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, 2015, and June 30, 2015, and Note 12, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2015, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, provide additional disclosure for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars.We currently face competition in Europe and the United States from biosimilars, and we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars in the future. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader marketing approval for biosimilars, our products will become subject to increased competition. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger such competition, and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products may also experience greater competition from lower-cost biosimilars that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose patent protection.In the European Union (EU), the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued since 2005. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some European countries, such as France, have considered and may adopt biosimilar uptake measures such as requiring physician prescribing quotas or automatic substitution by pharmacists of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products. Some EU countries may impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of the second or third biosimilar competitor. We cannot predict to what extent the entry of biosimilars or other competing products will impact future sales of our products in the EU. If we were unable to compete effectively, this could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Part 1, Item 1. Business—Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Approval of Biosimilars.) A growing number of companies have announced that they are in varying stages of development of biosimilar versions of existing biotechnology products, including biosimilars that would compete with our products. For example, one company recently began selling a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN®. Further, another has announced that its biosimilar candidates to NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta® have been accepted for review by the FDA. Pfizer, Hospira's parent company, recently announced that it had received a complete response from the FDA regarding Hospira's FDA marketing application for its epoetin product (biosimilar to EPOGEN®) and that it intends to amend its application and continue to work with the FDA towards approval. (For a discussion of ongoing litigation between us and these companies, see Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.) Some companies may pursue development of biosimilar versions of our products even in advance of the expiration of our material patents. For example, in June 2013, Sandoz filed suit against us, seeking a declaratory judgment that the etanercept product it was developing as a biosimilar to ENBREL did not infringe certain of our patents, and that those patents were also invalid and unenforceable. While that suit was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as Sandoz had not yet filed a marketing application with the FDA (see Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on 38Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014), Sandoz subsequently announced that its marketing application has now been accepted for review by the FDA. The U.S. pathway includes the option for biosimilar products meeting certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. Some companies currently developing biosimilars may seek to register their products as interchangeable biologics, which could make it easier for prescribers or pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our products. In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law's provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. While we are unable to predict the precise impact of the introduction of biosimilars on our products, we expect in the future to face greater competition in the United States as a result of biosimilars and downward pressure on our product prices and sales, subject to our ability to enforce our patents. This additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials.We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for NEUPOGEN®, Aranesp®, EPOGEN®, Prolia® and XGEVA® and substantially all of the formulation, fill and finish operations for ENBREL and Neulasta® at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. We also currently perform all of the bulk manufacturing for Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN® and Aranesp®, all of the purification of bulk EPOGEN® material and substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for Prolia® and XGEVA® at this facility. We perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill and finish, and packaging for product candidates to be used in clinical trials at our manufacturing facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. A number of factors could materially and adversely affect our operations, including:•power failures and/or other utility failures;•breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment;•improper installation or operation of equipment;•labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak;•inability or unwillingness of third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and components; and•natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes or fires.These or other problems may result in our being unable to supply our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. Our Puerto Rico facility is also subject to the same difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing experienced in our other manufacturing facilities. For example, the limited number of lots of EPOGEN® voluntarily recalled in 2010 were manufactured at our Puerto Rico facility. In future inspections, our failure to adequately address the FDA's expectations could lead to further inspections of the facility or regulatory actions. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) In June 2015, Puerto Rico’s Governor stated that the Puerto Rico government, which includes certain government entities, is unable to pay its roughly $72 billion in debt, and since that time, Puerto Rico failed to make certain debt payments. The Puerto Rico government proposed a Fiscal and Economic Growth Plan in September 2015, and currently is in negotiations with creditors to restructure its debt. The Governor recently stated that the government may run out of sufficient money to meet all of its obligations, including debt payments, before the end of the year and would have to choose between paying its creditors on time and providing essential government services. If the Puerto Rico government were not able to restructure the debt obligations or get forbearance on debt payments, it could impact the territorial government’s provision of utilities or other service in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business, result in migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, and make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico.39Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSDuring the three months ended September 30, 2015, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program.
