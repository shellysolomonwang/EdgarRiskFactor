Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II herein. We have based our forward looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, EPS, liquidity and capital resources and trends, including use of capital. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.  Overview  The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with GAAP.  Amgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as “Amgen,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is the world’s largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We focus solely on human therapeutics and concentrate on innovating novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We operate in one business segment — human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.  Currently, we market primarily recombinant protein therapeutics in supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products are: Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa) and EPOGEN® (Epoetin alfa), erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs); Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim); NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim); and Enbrel® (etanercept), all of which are sold in the United States. We market ENBREL under a collaboration agreement with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) in the United States and Canada. Our international product sales consist principally of European sales of Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. For the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, our principal products represented 89% and 92% of worldwide product sales, respectively. Our other marketed products include Sensipar®/Mimpara® (cinacalcet), Vectibix® (panitumumab), Nplate® (romiplostim), Prolia® (denosumab) and XGEVA™ (denosumab).  22    Table of Contents  Significant developments  The following is a list of selected significant developments that occurred to date during 2011 affecting our business:  ESAs       •   We continue to work closely with the FDA to finalize ESA labeling changes that could further limit ESA treatment in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients both on dialysis and not on dialysis.         •   The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis became effective on January 1, 2011 and provides a single payment for all dialysis services, including drugs that were previously reimbursed separately (except for oral drugs without intravenous equivalents for which the bundling rules have been postponed). Substantially all dialysis providers in the United States opted into the bundled payment system in its entirety on January 1, 2011. As expected, the bundled payment system has decreased dose utilization of EPOGEN®, and this decrease has had a material adverse impact on our EPOGEN® sales.         •   In 2010 and in early 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) engaged in a number of activities to examine the use of ESAs in certain patients with kidney disease, including holding a March 2010 meeting of the Medicare Evidence Development & Coverage Advisory Committee (MEDCAC), opening a National Coverage Analysis (NCA) in June 2010 to examine the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD and dialysis-related anemia, as well as holding another MEDCAC meeting in January 2011 to review the impact of ESA use on renal transplant graft survival. On March 16, 2011, CMS issued a Proposed Decision Memorandum (PDM) as part of its ongoing NCA proposing that a National Coverage Determination (NCD) not be issued at that time. CMS solicited public comments on their proposal and indicated that they would respond to these comments and conclude the NCA process on or before June 16, 2011, but CMS could propose an NCD at any time prior to that deadline.    The above factors, individually or in combination, may have a material adverse impact on future sales of our ESA products.  Prolia®       •   We estimate that the large majority of Prolia® usage to date has been through the buy and bill process under Medicare Part B. However, we believe that primary care physicians may have a preference to write a prescription for Prolia® and utilize the pharmacy benefit, most frequently the prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D. We are in the process of securing Part D coverage with what we believe to be affordable patient co-pays and prior authorizations consistent with product labeling.    Vectibix®       •   On March 18, 2011, we received notice that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a negative opinion for Amgen’s application to extend the marketing authorization in Europe for Vectibix® to include its use in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer. On March 30, 2011, we announced we had submitted a request to the EMA for a re-examination of the negative opinion.    Pipeline       •   On March 30, 2011, we along with our partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited/Millennium Pharmaceuticals announced top-line results from the MONET1 pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating motesanib administered in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in 1,090 patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The trial did not meet its primary objective of demonstrating an improvement in overall survival.    23    Table of Contents     Dividend and Stock Repurchases       •   On April 20, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a dividend policy related to our common stock and authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of our common stock. We expect to announce our initial quarterly dividend in connection with our second quarter of 2011 earnings announcement.    Acquisition       •   On March 4, 2011, we acquired BioVex, a privately held biotechnology company developing treatments for cancer and the prevention of infectious disease, including OncoVEXGM-CSF, a novel oncolytic vaccine in phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of melanoma and head and neck cancer. Under the terms of this transaction, we paid $407 million in cash and incurred contingent consideration obligations to make up to $575 million in additional payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones with regard to OncoVEXGM-CSF. The aggregate fair value as of the acquisition date of these contingent consideration obligations was $190 million. These obligations are revalued each subsequent reporting period until the underlying contingencies are resolved, with any resulting changes in their fair values recorded in earnings. In connection with the acquisition, we also recorded intangible assets of $675 million with respect to the IPR&D project for OncoVEXGM-CSF. The addition of this IPR&D project to our ongoing clinical development programs is not anticipated to materially increase our ongoing R&D expenses. For a more detailed description of this transaction, see Note 2, Acquisitions to our condensed consolidated financial statements.    24    Table of Contents     Selected Financial Data  The following table presents selected financial data (amounts in millions, except percentages and per share data):                                       Three months ended                March 31,                2011     2010     Change     Product sales:                          U.S.   $ 2,778     $ 2,677       4  %   International     840       851       (1 )%                          Total product sales     3,618       3,528       3  %                              Other revenues     88       64       38  %                          Total revenues   $ 3,706     $ 3,592       3  %                                                     Operating expenses   $ 2,413     $ 2,111       14  %                              Operating income   $ 1,293     $ 1,481       (13 )%                              Net income   $ 1,125     $ 1,167       (4 )%                              Diluted EPS   $ 1.20     $ 1.18       2  %                              Diluted shares     941       988       (5 )%     The following discusses certain key changes in our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2011 as well as our financial condition as of March 31, 2011.  Our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2011 were impacted by a new excise tax in Puerto Rico. Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the purchase of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. This tax is currently scheduled to expire in 2016. We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, a significant portion of the excise tax results in tax credits that are recognized in our provision for income taxes when the excise tax is paid. This excise tax will have a significant adverse impact on our cost of sales and a significant favorable impact on our provision for income taxes. In addition, the overall impact of the excise tax will vary period to period as a result of the timing difference between recognizing the expense and the applicable tax credit. For the three months ended March 31, 2011, operating expenses were adversely impacted by $13 million and the provision for income taxes was favorably impacted by $67 million as a result of this excise tax.  The increase in U.S. product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was driven primarily by increases in sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®, ENBREL, XGEVA™ and Prolia®, offset partially by decreases in sales of EPOGEN® and Aranesp®.  International product sales decreased slightly for the three months ended March 31, 2011 driven by decreases in Aranesp® and Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales, largely offset by increases in sales of our other marketed products.  The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was driven primarily by higher SG&A costs of $139 million and higher R&D costs of $90 million.  The decrease in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was due primarily to lower operating income offset partially by higher net realized gains on investments and a lower effective income tax rate, due primarily to higher tax credits in 2011 associated with the new Puerto Rico excise tax.  The increase in diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was due to the reduction in the number of shares used in the calculation of diluted EPS, offset partially by the reduction in net income. The decrease in the number of shares used in the computation of diluted EPS reflects the impact of our stock repurchase program. Due to the timing difference noted above associated with the new Puerto Rico excise tax, our diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2011 were favorably impacted by approximately $0.06.  25    Table of Contents  As of March 31, 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $15.4 billion and total debt outstanding was $10.9 billion. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of March 31, 2011, approximately $13.6 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates.  Product sales  Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                       Three months ended                March 31,                2011     2010     Change     Aranesp®   $ 580     $ 627       (7 )%   EPOGEN®     535       623       (14 )%   Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®     1,232       1,179       4  %   ENBREL     875       804       9  %   Sensipar®/Mimpara®     187       179       4  %   Vectibix®     75       67       12  %   Nplate®     65       49       33  %   Prolia®     27       —       —    XGEVA™     42       —       —                           Total product sales   $ 3,618     $ 3,528       3  %                                                     Total U.S.   $ 2,778     $ 2,677       4  %   Total International     840       851       (1 )%                          Total product sales   $ 3,618     $ 3,528       3  %                            Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our existing products more significantly than others. For a list of certain of these factors, see Results of Operations — Product Sales in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  Aranesp®  Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                       Three months ended                March 31,                2011     2010     Change     Aranesp® — U.S.   $ 250     $ 268       (7 )%   Aranesp® — International     330       359       (8 )%                          Total Aranesp®   $ 580     $ 627       (7 )%                            The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was due principally to a mid-teens percentage point decrease in unit demand, offset partially by an increase in the average net sales price. This sales decrease reflects an overall decline in the segment.  The decrease in international Aranesp® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was due principally to decreases in both unit demand and the average net sales price, reflecting an overall decline in the segment.  26    Table of Contents  Future Aranesp® sales will depend, in part, on the factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and such factors as:       •   regulatory developments, including:         -   product label changes, including those that we are working with the FDA to finalize that could further limit ESA treatment in CKD patients both on dialysis and not on dialysis;         -   the ongoing compliance requirements for our ESA risk evaluation and mitigation strategy;          •   reimbursement developments, including the potential imposition of an NCD or other developments resulting from the NCA opened by CMS in June 2010 and the associated MEDCAC meetings; and         •   development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.    Certain of the above factors, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp®.  EPOGEN®  Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                       Three months ended                March 31,                2011     2010     Change     EPOGEN® — U.S.   $ 535     $ 623       (14 )%                            The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was due primarily to a decline in unit demand, offset slightly by an increase in the average net sales price. The decrease in unit demand reflects a decrease in dose utilization as healthcare providers continued to implement new dose regimens in connection with the implementation of the bundled payment system, offset slightly by patient population growth.  Future EPOGEN® sales will depend, in part, on the factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and such factors as:       •   product label changes, including those that we are working with the FDA to finalize that could further limit ESA treatment in CKD patients both on dialysis and not on dialysis;         •   reimbursement developments, including those resulting from:         -   CMS’s Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis;         -   Other CMS activities, including the potential imposition of an NCD or other developments resulting from the NCA opened by CMS in June 2010 and the associated MEDCAC meetings;         •   changes in dose fluctuations as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling; and         •   adoption of alternative therapies or development of new modalities to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure.    Certain of the above factors, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse impact on future sales of EPOGEN®.  27    Table of Contents  Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®  Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                       Three months ended                March 31,                2011     2010     Change     Neulasta® — U.S.   $ 710     $ 637       11  %   NEUPOGEN® — U.S.     220       225       (2 )%                          U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total     930       862       8  %                          Neulasta® — International     226       226       —    NEUPOGEN® — International     76       91       (16 )%                          International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total     302       317       (5 )%                          Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®   $ 1,232     $ 1,179       4  %                            The increase in combined U.S. sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, an increase in unit demand.  The decrease in combined Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® international sales for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was driven primarily by a decline in NEUPOGEN® sales as a result of biosimilar competition, offset partially by growth in Neulasta® sales due, in part, to continued conversion of NEUPOGEN® to Neulasta®.  Future Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales will depend, in part, on the factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  ENBREL  Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                       Three months ended                March 31,                2011     2010     Change     ENBREL — U.S.   $ 821     $ 754       9 %   ENBREL — Canada     54       50       8 %                          Total ENBREL   $ 875     $ 804       9 %                            The increase in ENBREL sales for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, an increase in unit demand. This increase reflects segment growth, offset partially by share declines. ENBREL continues to maintain a leading position in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments.  Future ENBREL sales will depend, in part, on the factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  28    Table of Contents  Other products  Other product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                       Three months ended                March 31,                2011     2010     Change     Sensipar® — U.S.   $ 116     $ 117       (1 )%   Sensipar® (Mimpara®) — International     71       62       15  %   Vectibix® — U.S.     30       25       20  %   Vectibix® — International     45       42       7  %   Nplate® — U.S.     37       28       32  %   Nplate® — International     28       21       33  %   Prolia® — U.S.     17       —       —    Prolia® — International     10       —       —    XGEVA™ — U.S.     42       —       —                           Total other products   $ 396     $ 295       34  %                                                     Total U.S.   $ 242     $ 170       42  %   Total International     154       125       23  %                          Total other products   $ 396     $ 295       34  %                            Future sales of our other products will depend, in part, on the factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  29    Table of Contents  Selected operating expenses  The following table presents selected operating expenses (dollar amounts in millions):                                       Three months ended                March 31,                2011     2010     Change     Cost of sales   $ 564     $ 508       11 %   % of product sales     15.6 %     14.4 %                                     Research and development   $ 736     $ 646       14 %   % of product sales     20.3 %     18.3 %                                     Selling, general and administrative   $ 1,023     $ 884       16 %   % of product sales     28.3 %     25.1 %            Cost of sales  Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, increased to 15.6% of product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2011, driven primarily by higher bulk material cost, certain expenses related to actions to improve cost efficiencies and the new excise tax associated with our manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico, offset partially by higher average net sales prices and lower royalties.  Research and development  The increase in R&D expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was attributable primarily to: $46 million of higher clinical trial costs, reflecting our strategic decision to invest in late stage clinical trials, including AMG 386 and AMG 479, and to augment support for marketed products; and $28 million of higher staff related costs, primarily in support of international expansion and discovery research.  Selling, general and administrative  The increase in SG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was due primarily to certain expenses that did not occur in the same period last year, including the U.S. Healthcare Reform Excise Fee of $39 million and promotional costs of $39 million, due primarily to the launches of Prolia® and XGEVA™. This increase was also driven by $30 million of higher ENBREL profit share expense, under our collaboration agreement with Pfizer, due to increased ENBREL sales. For the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, excluding expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share of $299 million and $269 million, respectively, SG&A expenses increased 18%.  Under our collaboration agreement, we currently pay Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada attributable to all approved indications for ENBREL on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, we maintain a majority share of ENBREL profits. After expiration of the agreement in the fourth quarter of 2013, we will be required to pay Pfizer a declining percentage of annual net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada for three years, ranging from 12% to 10%. The amounts of such payments are anticipated to be significantly less than what would be owed based on the terms of the current ENBREL profit share.  30    Table of Contents  Non-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes  The following table presents non-operating expenses/income and the provisions for income taxes (dollar amounts in millions):                             Three months ended        March 31,        2011     2010      Interest expense, net   $ 135     $ 145    Interest and other income, net   $ 148     $ 84    Provisions for income taxes   $ 181     $ 253    Effective income tax rate     13.9 %     17.8 %     Interest expense, net  Included in interest expense, net for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 is the impact of non-cash interest expense of $44 million and $65 million, respectively, resulting from the change in the accounting for our convertible debt effective January 1, 2009.  Interest and other income, net  The increase in interest and other income, net for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was due primarily to higher net realized gains on investments of $61 million.  Income taxes  Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was 13.9% compared to 17.8% for the corresponding period of the prior year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was due primarily to higher tax credits in 2011 associated with the new Puerto Rico excise tax and the federal R&D credit, offset partially by the inclusion of the non-deductible U.S. Healthcare Reform Excise Fee in 2011 and changes in revenue and expense mix. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2011 without the impact of the tax credits associated with the new Puerto Rico excise tax would have been 18.8%.  See Note 3, Income taxes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  31    Table of Contents  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources  The following table summarizes selected financial data (in millions):                             March 31,     December 31,        2011     2010      Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities   $ 15,358     $ 17,422    Total assets     42,714       43,486    Current debt     83       2,488    Non-current debt     10,824       10,874    Stockholders’ equity     24,984       23,944      On April 20, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a dividend policy related to our common stock. We expect to announce our initial quarterly dividend in connection with our second quarter of 2011 earnings announcement. In addition to the planned dividend, the Company intends to continue to return cash to stockholders through share repurchases. Both our plans to pay dividends and opportunistically repurchase stock reflect our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. Repurchases under our stock repurchase program also reflect our confidence in the long-term value of our common stock. The amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a number of factors including the stock price, dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares, and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. As of March 31, 2011, we had $2.2 billion remaining under the Board of Director’s previous stock repurchase authorization, and on April 20, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of our common stock. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of factors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock in Part II hereof.  We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure, dividend and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to opportunistically pursue our stock repurchase program and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sale of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other debt markets and equity markets.  Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of March 31, 2011. None of our financing arrangements contain any financial covenants.  Cash flows  The following table summarizes our cash flow activity (in millions):                             Three months ended March 31,        2011     2010      Net cash provided by operating activities   $ 1,030     $ 913    Net cash used in investing activities     (555 )     (955 )   Net cash used in financing activities     (2,496 )     (576 )     Operating  Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2011 increased due primarily to the timing and amounts of payments to tax authorities offset partially by the impact of increased inventory related expenditures.  32    Table of Contents  Investing  Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2011 was primarily for the acquisition of BioVex, net of cash acquired of $403 million, and for the three months ended March 31, 2010 was primarily for net purchases of marketable securities of $849 million. Capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 totaled $100 million and $94 million, respectively. Capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and other site developments. We currently estimate 2011 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $600 million.  Financing  In February 2011, the 2011 Convertible Notes became due and we repaid the $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount. See Note 8, Financing arrangements to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our long-term borrowings.  During the three months ended March 31, 2011, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. However, we had a net cash outflow of $14 million related to the settlement of shares of our common stock repurchased during the three months ended December 31, 2010. During the three months ended March 31, 2010, we repurchased 29.1 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $1.7 billion, of which $1.6 billion represented a net cash outflow in the period.  Summary of Critical Accounting Policies  A discussion of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and is supplemented with the accounting policy discussed below. Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations  We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to:       •   determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;         •   projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;         •   estimating future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and         •   developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows.    Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with a business combination. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred in the acquisition of BioVex were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations.  We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.  33    Table of Contents     Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Information about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and is incorporated herein by reference. There have been no material changes for the three months ended March 31, 2011 to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.     Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2011.  Management determined that, as of March 31, 2011, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  34    Table of Contents     PART II — OTHER INFORMATION     Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  See Note 12, Contingencies and commitments to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion which is limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. These discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 19, Contingencies and commitments to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.     Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described the primary risks relating to our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and periodically update those risks for material developments. These risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, operations, liquidity and stock price materially and adversely.  Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 provide additional disclosure and context for these supplemental risks for the first quarter 2011 and are incorporated herein by reference.  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.  On March 16, 2011, CMS issued a PDM as part of its ongoing NCA for the treatment of CKD and dialysis-related anemia. In the PDM, CMS proposed that an NCD not be issued at that time. CMS solicited public comments on their proposal and indicated that they would respond to these comments and conclude the NCA process on or before June 16, 2011, but the conclusion may or may not be consistent with the PDM and CMS could still propose an NCD at some point in the future. Changes to the ESA label could affect CMS’s decision as to whether to proceed with an NCD or the contents of such NCD, and may also lead to other changes in reimbursement policies or practices, including CMS’s End Stage Renal Disease Quality Improvement Program (ESRD QIP) and/or bundled payment system for dialysis treatment.  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.  We continue to work closely with the FDA to finalize ESA labeling changes that could further limit ESA treatment in CKD patients both on dialysis and not on dialysis.  Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.  We continue to work closely with the FDA to finalize ESA labeling changes that could further limit ESA treatment in CKD patients both on dialysis and not on dialysis. We also continue to cooperate with CMS in determining appropriate coverage and reimbursement for our ESAs. On March 16, 2011, CMS issued a PDM as part of its ongoing NCA for the treatment of CKD and dialysis-related anemia. In the PDM, CMS proposed that an NCD not be issued at that time. CMS solicited public comments on their proposal and indicated that they would respond to these comments and conclude the NCA process on or before June 16, 2011, but the conclusion may or may not be consistent with the PDM and CMS could still propose an NCD at some point in the future. Changes to the ESA label could affect CMS’s decision as to whether to proceed with an NCD or the contents of such NCD, and may also lead to other changes in reimbursement policies or practices, including CMS’s ESRD QIP and/or bundled payment system for dialysis treatment.  Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.  In March 2011, the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Western District of Washington informed Amgen that the subject matter of its investigation would be transferred to the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of New York.  35    Table of Contents  There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.  On April 20, 2011, our Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which the Company would pay quarterly dividends on our common stock, and increased the total authorization for repurchases of our common stock to $7.2 billion. Whether we continue and the amount and timing of such dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and agreements of the Company applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends and the repurchase of stock. Future dividends and stock repurchases, their timing and amount, as well as the relative allocation of cash between dividends and stock repurchases, may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions; debt service requirements; our credit rating; changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares. Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.  36    Table of Contents     Item 6. EXHIBITS
