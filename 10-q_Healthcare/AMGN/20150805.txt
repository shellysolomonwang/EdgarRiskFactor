For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2015.Products/Pipeline CardiovascularRepatha™ (evolocumab)•In June 2015, the Company discussed the data supporting the BLA for the treatment of high cholesterol with the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee. A majority of the Committee recommended approval of Repatha™ for the treatment of high cholesterol in multiple high-risk patient populations, and were unanimously in favor of approval for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. FDA advisory committees review marketed and investigational human drug products, including safety and effectiveness data, and make recommendations to the FDA. These committees are advisory and FDA officials are not bound to or limited by its recommendations, although the FDA has commonly followed the recommendations of its advisory panels. The FDA PDUFA target action date for our BLA is August 27, 2015.•In July 2015, we announced that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Repatha™ for the treatment of high cholesterol, as an adjunct to diet:◦In combination with statins or other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to control their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with maximum tolerated statin doses, or◦Alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin intolerant or for whom a statin is contraindicated.Repatha™ is also approved in the European Union (EU) in combination with other lipid-lowering agents in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (age 12 and over).InflammationBrodalumab•In May 2015, we announced that we commenced termination of our participation in the co-development and commercialization of brodalumab with AstraZeneca. The decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program.NeuroscienceAMG 334•In July 2015, we announced that we initiated phase 3 studies in episodic migraine.OncologyKyprolis®  •In July 2015, we announced that we submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for Kyprolis® to seek an expanded indication for the treatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, who have received at least one prior therapy, based on data from the global phase 3 ENDEAVOR (RandomizEd, OpeN Label, Phase 3 Study of Carfilzomib Plus DExamethAsone Vs Bortezomib Plus DexamethasOne in Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma) trial.•In July 2015, we announced that the FDA approved the sNDA for Kyprolis® in combination with Revlimid® (lenalidomide) and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy, based on the phase 3 ASPIRE (CArfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and DexamethaSone versus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for the treatment of PatIents with Relapsed Multiple MyEloma) trial.26Prolia® •In June 2015, we announced that the phase 3 study evaluating the treatment effect of adjuvant Prolia® therapy in postmenopausal women with early hormone receptor positive breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy, met its primary endpoint.Talimogene laherparepvec•In April 2015, the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee and the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA jointly reviewed our talimogene laherparepvec BLA, with a majority voting that talimogene laherparepvec has a favorable risk-benefit profile for the treatment of injectable regionally or distantly metastatic melanoma. The FDA PDUFA target action date for our BLA is October 27, 2015.Vectibix® •In June 2015, we announced that the phase 3 study evaluating Vectibix® and best supportive care met its primary endpoint.Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2015 2014 Change 2015 2014 ChangeProduct sales:           U.S.$4,105 $3,758 9 % $7,876 $7,047 12 %Rest of the world (ROW)1,120 1,191 (6)% 2,223 2,258 (2)%Total product sales5,225 4,949 6 % 10,099 9,305 9 %Other revenues145 231 (37)% 304 396 (23)%Total revenues$5,370 $5,180 4 % $10,403 $9,701 7 %Operating expenses$3,294 $3,278 — % $6,305 $6,435 (2)%Operating income$2,076 $1,902 9 % $4,098 $3,266 25 %Net income$1,653 $1,547 7 % $3,276 $2,620 25 %Diluted EPS$2.15 $2.01 7 % $4.26 $3.41 25 %Diluted shares768 768 — % 769 768 — %The increase in global product sales for the three months ended June 30, 2015, was driven by ENBREL, Prolia®, Sensipar®, Kyprolis® and XGEVA®. The increase in global product sales for the six months ended June 30, 2015, was driven by ENBREL, Prolia®, Sensipar®, XGEVA® and Kyprolis®. Other revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, included the receipt of a $30-million milestone payment.The decrease in operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2015, was driven primarily as a result of savings from transformation and process improvement efforts under our restructuring plan, offset partially by increased investments for launching new products.Increases in net income and diluted EPS for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, were driven by increases in operating income.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates were not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014.27Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2015 2014 Change  2015 2014 Change Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®$1,414 $1,429 (1)% $2,794 $2,808 — %ENBREL1,348 1,243 8 % 2,464 2,231 10 %XGEVA® 331 299 11 % 671 578 16 %Prolia® 340 264 29 % 612 460 33 %EPOGEN®491 512 (4)% 1,025 974 5 %Aranesp®479 517 (7)% 959 977 (2)%Sensipar®/Mimpara®344 298 15 % 678 568 19 %Other products478 387 24 % 896 709 26 %Total product sales$5,225 $4,949 6 % $10,099 $9,305 9 %Future sales of our products are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others.

The decreases in global NEUPOGEN® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, were driven primarily by a decrease in unit demand due to the impact of short-acting competition. We face competition in the United States, which could have an impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN® and, to a lesser extent, Neulasta®. Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta® ) expires in October 2015. Apotex, Inc. announced that the FDA accepted for filing their applications, under the abbreviated pathway, for pegfilgrastim, a biosimilar version of Neulasta®, on December 17, 2014, and for filgrastim, a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN®, on February 17, 2015.On March 6, 2015, Sandoz, a Novartis company, announced that the FDA approved its biosimilar filgrastim, Zarxio™, for all indications then included in the reference product’s (NEUPOGEN®) label. The Sandoz biosimilar filgrastim is the subject of ongoing litigation between us and Sandoz. On July 21, 2015, the Federal Circuit Court concluded that a biosimilar applicant must give 180-day advance notice of first commercial marketing after the FDA has licensed the biosimilar product. Accordingly, the Federal Circuit Court entered an order that its previously entered injunction be extended through September 2, 2015 (180 days from Sandoz’s notice given after FDA approval). See Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.28ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2015 2014 Change  2015 2014 Change ENBREL — U.S.$1,280 $1,171 9 % $2,332 $2,095 11 %ENBREL — Canada68 72 (6)% 132 136 (3)%Total ENBREL$1,348 $1,243 8 % $2,464 $2,231 10 %The increases in ENBREL sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, were driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by a decline in units.XGEVA® and Prolia®  Total XGEVA® and total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2015 2014 Change  2015 2014 Change XGEVA® — U.S.$234 $207 13% $479 $407 18%XGEVA® — ROW97 92 5% 192 171 12%Total XGEVA®331 299 11% 671 578 16%Prolia® — U.S.215 159 35% 385 278 38%Prolia® — ROW125 105 19% 227 182 25%Total Prolia®340 264 29% 612 460 33%Total XGEVA®/Prolia®$671 $563 19% $1,283 $1,038 24%The increases in global XGEVA® and Prolia® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, were driven by increases in unit demand.

We face competition in the United States, which may have a material adverse impact over time on EPOGEN® sales. Currently, in the United States, EPOGEN® and Aranesp® compete with MIRCERA®, which F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. (Roche) began selling in October 2014 and, as of May 2015, licensed commercialization rights in the United States to Galenica Group. MIRCERA® competes with Aranesp® in the nephrology segment only. On December 16, 2014, Hospira, Inc. submitted a BLA to the FDA for Retacrit™, a proposed biosimilar to EPOGEN®, under the abbreviated pathway.29Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2015 2014 Change  2015 2014 Change Aranesp® — U.S.$223 $223 — % $412 $400 3 %Aranesp® — ROW256 294 (13)% 547 577 (5)%Total Aranesp®$479 $517 (7)% $959 $977 (2)%The decreases in global Aranesp® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, were driven primarily by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, price declines outside the United States, and positive Medicaid rebate estimate adjustments in the prior year.

We continue to estimate that this restructuring plan will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $935 million to $1,035 million, of which $713 million was incurred through June 30, 2015. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we incurred $63 million and $155 million, respectively, of restructuring costs. We expect that most of the remaining estimated costs will be incurred during the remainder of 2015 to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts.Net savings are not expected to be significant in 2015 due to investments in new product launches and external business development.Additional disclosure information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Note 2, Restructuring, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 20.3% and 20.4% of total revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The decreases were driven by lower royalties and higher average net sales prices. The six months ended June 30, 2014 also included a $99-million charge related to the termination of the supply contract with Roche as a result of acquiring the licenses to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim in certain territories effective January 1, 2014. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 18.5% and 18.6% of total revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared with 19.0% and 20.4% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe decrease in R&D expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2015, was driven primarily by decreased costs associated with Discovery Research and Translational Sciences (DRTS) of $76 million, offset partially by increased costs in later stage clinical programs support and marketed products support of $16 million and $6 million, respectively.The decrease in R&D expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2015, was driven by decreased costs associated with DRTS, marketed products support and later stage clinical programs support of $163 million, $18 million and $6 million, respectively. All categories of R&D spend benefited from savings from transformation and process improvement efforts under our restructuring plan. Throughout the remainder of 2015 these savings are expected to be offset partially by investments in support of our launch products as well as reinvestment in DRTS.31Selling, general and administrativeThe increases in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 were due to increased expenses related to new product launches, offset partially by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts under our restructuring plan.OtherOther operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, included a legal proceeding charge of $71 million and certain charges related to our restructuring plan, primarily severance, of $10 million and $67 million, respectively.Other operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, included certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives, primarily severance, of $23 million and $38 million, respectively, and increases to the estimated aggregate fair value of the contingent consideration obligations of $14 million and $15 million, respectively.Non-operating expenses/income and income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended Six months ended June 30, June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014Interest expense, net$277 $282 $529 $541Interest and other income, net$198 $138 $304 $237Provision for income taxes$344 $211 $597 $342Effective tax rate17.2% 12.0% 15.4% 11.5%Interest expense, netThe decreases in interest expense, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, were due primarily to the recognition of expenses in connection with the repayment of the Master Repurchase Agreement in the second quarter of 2014. Interest and other income, netThe increases in interest and other income, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, were due primarily to higher interest income as a result of higher average cash balances and the gain on the sale of a strategic investment, offset partially by net losses on sales of interest-bearing securities recognized in the current year periods. Income taxesThe increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2015, was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses. The increase in our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2015, was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses, offset partially by a state tax audit settlement in the three months ended March 31, 2015.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, would have been 20.6% and 18.9%, respectively, compared with 16.7% and 16.2% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): June 30, 2015 December 31, 2014Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$29,993 $27,026Total assets$71,209 $69,009Current portion of long-term debt$1,250 $500Long-term debt$30,702 $30,215Stockholders’ equity$27,484 $25,77832The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and share repurchases, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. Whether and when we declare dividends and the size of any dividend could be affected by a number of factors. In addition, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors—There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or that we will repurchase stock. In December 2014 and March 2015 the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.79 per share of common stock, which were paid on March 6 and June 5, 2015, respectively. In July 2015, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.79 per share of common stock, which will be paid on September 8, 2015.The Company also returns capital to stockholders through its stock repurchase program. Repurchase activity under the program was temporarily suspended from the second quarter of 2013 through the third quarter of 2014, and we reinitiated repurchase activity during the fourth quarter of 2014. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we repurchased $966 million of stock (cash settlement of stock repurchases totaled $940 million). As of June 30, 2015, $2.9 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $275 million and $223 million, respectively. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary.Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaling $30.0 billion as of June 30, 2015, approximately $27.5 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan Credit Facility each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of June 30, 2015. 33Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Six months ended June 30, 2015 2014Net cash provided by operating activities$4,143 $3,369Net cash used in investing activities$(3,311) $(3,223)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities$(768) $401OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2015, benefited from an improvement in our operating margin and the effective termination of foreign currency forward contracts that resulted in receipt of $247 million in cash, offset partially by the timing of payments to vendors and tax authorities as well as receipts from customers, including the impact of $100 million received under a government-funded program in Spain during the prior year period.InvestingCash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2015, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $3.0 billion and capital expenditures of $251 million, offset partially by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $226 million. Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2014, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities and restricted investments of $2.6 billion and capital expenditures of $345 million. Capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in various locations, as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2015 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2015, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $1.2 billion, repurchases of common stock of $940 million and the settlement of an obligation incurred in the connection with the acquisition of Onyx of $225 million, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments of $1.3 billion. Cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2014, was due primarily to proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments of $1.1 billion, offset partially by the payment of dividends of $923 million.See Note 9, Financing arrangements, and Note 10, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2015.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and is incorporated herein by reference. There were no material changes during the six months ended June 30, 2015, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.34Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2015.Management determined that, as of June 30, 2015, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2015, and Note 12, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2015, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, provide additional disclosure for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we can manufacture, market and sell our products. The approval by regulatory authorities of our product candidates will depend on the assessment by such regulatory authorities of the benefit-risk profile reflected by the totality of the efficacy and safety information available for our product candidates. Decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling, ingredients and other matters could adversely affect the approval and availability of our products. Once approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions. The sanctions could include the FDA’s or foreign regulatory authorities’ refusal to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution.35Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval has been and will continue to be increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. There may be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to comparative products can be shown. Also, legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations or change existing laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. For example, the EU has new legislation, which will apply as early as mid-2016, related to the conduct of clinical trials. While the aim of the new legislation is improvement in operational efficiency and a streamlining of the overall clinical trial authorization process, the new requirements also provide for increased transparency of clinical trial results and submission of quality data relating to the products and product candidates used for such trials. Starting in 2016, the EMA expects to make certain clinical trial reports publicly available, which may limit our ability to protect competitively-sensitive information contained in our clinical trial reports. Failure to comply with new laws or regulations could result in significant monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. We are unable to predict when and whether any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as efforts to reform medical device regulation or the pedigree requirements for medical products or to implement new requirements for combination products, and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Regulatory authorities may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. For example, questions remain about regulatory authorities’ views regarding the adequacy for approval of therapeutic oncology products that have demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in endpoints such as progression-free survival (PFS) or Durable Response Rate (DRR) but have not shown a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using endpoints other than overall survival, such as PFS, DRR, and bone-metastasis-free survival (BMFS). The use of endpoints such as PFS, DRR, or BMFS, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. The imposition of additional requirements may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, and delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or maintenance of our current labels.Some of our products are approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, in July 2012 our subsidiary Onyx Pharmaceuticals received accelerated approval for Kyprolis® used as a single agent in the United States, with full approval conditioned on us conducting additional clinical trials of the use of Kyprolis® as a therapy in treating multiple myeloma. In July 2015, the FDA expanded the indication by giving Kyprolis® full approval when used in combination with two other therapies. (See Part 1, Item 2. MD&A—Significant developments.) However, when used as a single agent, Kyprolis® remains under its original conditional, or accelerated, approval. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. If we are unable to fulfill the requirements of regulators that were conditions of our products' accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators re-evaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product in connection with a renewal assessment, our conditional approval may be revoked or not renewed or we may not receive full approval for these products or may be required to change the products' labeled indications or even withdraw the products from the market.Safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required to continuously collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In 2012, pharmacovigilance legislation became effective in the EU that enhanced the authority of European regulators to require companies to conduct additional post-approval clinical efficacy and safety studies and increased the requirement on sponsor companies to analyze and evaluate the risk-benefit profiles of their products. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including monetary fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours and that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product’s approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:•revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that may result in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate; •requirement of risk management activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;36•mandated post-marketing commitments or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;•product recalls of our approved products;•revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types;•increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or•fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies.For example, since 2006, when adverse safety results involving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were observed, ESAs continue to be the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny. Reviews by regulatory authorities of the risk-benefit profile of ESAs has resulted in and may continue to result in changes to ESA labeling and usage in both the oncology and nephrology clinical settings. In addition, on May 22, 2015, we announced that we commenced termination of our participation in the co-development and commercialization of brodalumab with AstraZeneca. The decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program, which we believe likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population.In addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of nine products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. In many markets there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provided for such a pathway; while the FDA is working to implement it, significant questions remain as to how products will be approved under the pathway. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors—We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars.) Delays or uncertainties in the development of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. Additionally, biosimilar products may be subject to patent dispute resolution and/or patent infringement litigation, which could delay or prevent the commercial launch of a product.We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials.We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN®, Aranesp®, EPOGEN®, Prolia® and XGEVA® and substantially all of the formulation, fill and finish operations for ENBREL at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. We also currently perform all of the bulk manufacturing for Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN® and Aranesp®, all of the purification of bulk EPOGEN® material and substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for Prolia® and XGEVA® at this facility. We perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill and finish, and packaging for product candidates to be used in clinical trials at our manufacturing facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. A number of factors could materially and adversely affect our operations, including:•power failures and/or other utility failures;•breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment;•improper installation or operation of equipment;•labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak;•inability or unwillingness of third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and components; and•natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes or fires.These or other problems may result in our being unable to supply our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. Our Puerto Rico facility is also subject to the same difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing experienced in our other manufacturing facilities. For example, the limited number of lots of EPOGEN® voluntarily recalled in 2010 were manufactured at our Puerto Rico facility. In future inspections, our failure to adequately address the FDA's expectations could lead to further inspections of the facility or regulatory actions. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) In June 2015, Puerto Rico’s governor stated that Puerto Rico was not able to pay its roughly $72 billion in debt, and on August 3, 2015, Puerto Rico failed to make a $58 million bond payment. If the P37uerto Rico government were not able to restructure the debt obligations or get forbearance on debt payments, it could impact the territorial government’s provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business, result in migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States and make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico.Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSDuring the three months ended June 30, 2015, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program. Our repurchase activity for the three months ended June 30, 2015, was as follows: Total numberof sharespurchased Averageprice paidper share Total number ofshares purchasedas part of publicly announced program Maximum dollarvalue that mayyet be purchasedunder the program(1)April 1 - April 30532,300 $160.76 532,300 $3,310,258,090May 1 - May 311,027,900 159.15 1,027,900 3,146,663,762June 1 - June 301,694,000 156.74 1,694,000 2,881,142,334 3,254,200 $158.16 3,254,200  (1)In October 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an increase that resulted in a total of $4.0 billion available under the stock repurchase program.Item 6.
