Overview  The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with GAAP.  Amgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as “Amgen,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is the world’s largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We focus solely on human therapeutics and concentrate on innovative novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We operate in one business segment — human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.  Currently, we market primarily recombinant protein therapeutics in supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products are Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim); NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim); ENBREL (etanercept); and Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa) and EPOGEN® (epoetin alfa), erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Our international product sales consist principally of sales in Europe. For the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, our principal products represented 83% and 89% of worldwide product sales, respectively. Our other marketed products include principally Sensipar®/Mimpara® (cinacalcet), Vectibix® (panitumumab), Nplate® (romiplostim), Prolia® (denosumab) and XGEVA® (denosumab).    22    Table of Contents Significant developments  The following is a summary of selected significant developments that occurred to date during 2012 affecting our business. For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.  XGEVA®        •    On April 26, 2012, we announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the supplemental Biologics License Application for XGEVA® to treat men with castration-resistant prostate cancer at high risk of developing bone metastases. The Complete Response Letter states that the FDA cannot approve the application in its present form. The FDA determined that the effect on bone metastases-free survival was of insufficient magnitude to outweigh the risks (including osteonecrosis of the jaw) of XGEVA® in the intended population, and requested data from an adequate and well-controlled trial(s) demonstrating a favorable risk-benefit profile for XGEVA® that is generalizable to the U.S. population. We are reviewing the Complete Response Letter and will work with the FDA to determine any next steps.  Sensipar®         •    On April 24, 2012, we announced that we expect to see results of the EValuation Of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events (E.V.O.L.V.E™) study, our phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study of cinacalcet in the treatment for dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, in mid 2012.  AMG 785        •    On April 4, 2012, we along with our partner UCB announced the start of a two-year phase 3 clinical study in more than 5,000 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The primary endpoint will evaluate the incidence of new vertebral fractures at 12 months.  Acquisitions/Collaborations        •    On March 7, 2012, we acquired Micromet, a publicly held biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative antibody-based therapies for the treatment of cancer.        •    On April 25, 2012, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire no less than 95.6% of Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals (MN), a privately held Turkish pharmaceutical company. MN is the leading supplier of pharmaceuticals to the hospital sector and a major supplier of injectable medicines in Turkey. Through this acquisition, we will have the opportunity to expand our presence in Turkey and the surrounding region.        •    On March 30, 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to jointly develop and commercialize certain monoclonal antibodies from Amgen’s clinical inflammation portfolio including brodalumab (AMG 827), AMG 139, AMG 157, AMG 181 and AMG 557. The agreement covers the worldwide development and commercialization except for certain Asian countries for brodalumab and Japan for AMG 557, which are licensed to other third parties.    23    Table of Contents Selected financial information  The following provides an overview of our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2012, as well as our financial condition as of March 31, 2012 (amounts in millions, except percentages and per-share data):                        Three months endedMarch 31,              2012     2011      Change      Product sales:                  U.S.   $ 2,997     $ 2,778       8 %     International     904       840       8 %                                Total product sales     3,901       3,618       8 %          Other revenues     147       88       67 %                                Total revenues   $ 4,048     $ 3,706       9 %                                     Operating expenses   $ 2,571     $ 2,413       7 %          Operating income   $ 1,477     $ 1,293       14 %          Net income   $ 1,184     $ 1,125       5 %          Diluted EPS   $ 1.48     $ 1.20       23 %          Diluted shares     800       941       (15)%    The increase in U.S. product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2012, reflects growth for all of our marketed products, except ESAs, which declined 17%. Excluding sales of ESAs, U.S. product sales increased 18%.  The increase in international product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2012, reflects growth for all of our marketed products, except Aranesp® and combined Neulasta®/ NEUPOGEN® sales, which declined 4%, respectively.  The increase in other revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was due primarily to milestone payments received in connection with entering into a collaboration with AstraZeneca and receipt of marketing approval of AMG 223 in Japan by Astellas Pharma Inc.  The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was driven primarily by higher costs of sales largely attributable to the increase in the Puerto Rico excise tax, discussed below.  The increase in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was due primarily to higher operating income, offset partially by higher interest expense, net, due primarily to a higher average debt balance.  The increase in diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was driven primarily by the favorable impact of our stock repurchase program, which reduced the number of shares used to compute diluted EPS, and, to a lesser degree, an increase in net income.  Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the purchase of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is imposed over a six-year period beginning in 2011 with the excise tax rate declining in each year (4% in 2011, 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in 2013, 2.5% in 2014, 2.25% in 2015, and 1% in 2016). We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes when the excise tax is incurred. This excise tax has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our cost of sales and a significant favorable impact on our provision for income taxes. In addition, the overall impact of the excise tax will vary from period to period as a result of the timing difference between recognizing the expense and the applicable tax credit. For the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, cost of sales increased by $81 million and $13 million, respectively, and the provision for income taxes decreased by $87 million and $67 million, respectively, as a result of this excise tax.    24    Table of Contents As of March 31, 2012, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $19.4 billion and total debt outstanding was $21.4 billion. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of March 31, 2012, approximately $16.6 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates.  Results of operations  Product sales  Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                        Three months endedMarch 31,              2012     2011      Change      Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN ®   $ 1,344     $ 1,232       9 %     ENBREL     938       875       7 %     Aranesp®      518       580       (11)%     EPOGEN®      446       535       (17)%     Other products     655       396       65 %                                Total product sales   $ 3,901     $ 3,618       8 %                               Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others. For a list of certain of these factors and their potential impact on sales, see Item 7 — Product Sales in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.  Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®  Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                        Three months endedMarch 31,              2012     2011      Change      Neulasta® — U.S.   $ 814     $ 710       15 %     NEUPOGEN® — U.S.     239       220       9 %                                U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total     1,053       930       13 %                                Neulasta® — International     225       226       —      NEUPOGEN® — International     66       76       (13)%                                International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total     291       302       (4)%                                Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®   $ 1,344     $ 1,232       9 %                               The increase in combined U.S. sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, an increase in Neulasta® unit demand.  The decrease in combined Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® international sales for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was due primarily to a decrease in the average net sales price. A mid single-digit percentage point increase in Neulasta® unit demand was offset by a decline in NEUPOGEN® units due primarily to biosimilar competition as well as continued conversion to Neulasta®.  Future Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.    25    Table of Contents ENBREL  Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                        Three months endedMarch 31,              2012     2011      Change      ENBREL — U.S.   $ 878     $ 821       7 %     ENBREL — Canada     60       54       11 %                                Total ENBREL   $ 938     $ 875       7 %                               The increase in total ENBREL sales for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price. ENBREL remains the segment share leader in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments.  Future ENBREL sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.  Aranesp®  Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                        Three months endedMarch 31,              2012     2011      Change      Aranesp® — U.S.   $ 202     $ 250       (19)%     Aranesp® — International     316       330       (4)%                                Total Aranesp®   $ 518     $ 580       (11)%                               The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was due primarily to a decline in unit demand, offset partially by a mid single-digit percentage point increase in the average net sales price. The unit decline reflects segment contraction resulting from changes to the label and reimbursement environment that occurred during 2011.  The decrease in international Aranesp® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was due primarily to a decrease in the average net sales price.  Future Aranesp® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. Certain of these factors may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp®.    26    Table of Contents EPOGEN®  Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                        Three months endedMarch 31,              2012     2011      Change      EPOGEN® — U.S.   $ 446     $ 535       (17)%                               The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was due primarily to the impact of changes to the label and reimbursement that occurred in 2011. The decline was comprised of an approximately 30% decrease in unit demand driven by a reduction in dose utilization, offset partially by reductions in customer discounts as part of new provider contracts that became effective January 1, 2012.  Future EPOGEN® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and on the recent approval of Affymax, Inc.’s peginesatide by the FDA on March 27, 2012, which results in EPOGEN® facing competition in the U.S. dialysis setting for the first time. Certain of these factors may have a material adverse impact on future sales of EPOGEN®.  Other products  Other product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                        Three months endedMarch 31,              2012     2011      Change      Sensipar® — U.S.   $ 140     $ 116       21 %     Sensipar® (Mimpara®) — International     79       71       11 %     Vectibix® — U.S.     31       30       3 %     Vectibix® — International     59       45       31 %     Nplate® — U.S.     54       37       46 %     Nplate® — International     36       28       29 %     Prolia® — U.S.     54       17       —      Prolia® — International     34       10       —      XGEVA® — U.S.     139       42       —      XGEVA® — International     14       —        —      Other — International     15       —        —                                 Total other products   $ 655     $ 396       65 %                                     Total U.S.   $ 418     $ 242       73 %     Total International     237       154       54 %                                Total other products   $ 655     $ 396       65 %                               Future sales of our other products will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.    27    Table of Contents Selected operating expenses  Selected operating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                        Three months endedMarch 31,              2012     2011      Change      Cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets)   $ 679     $ 564       20 %     % of product sales     17.4%       15.6%          Research and development   $ 736     $ 736       —      % of product sales     18.9%       20.3%          Selling, general and administrative   $ 1,076     $ 1,023       5 %     % of product sales     27.6%       28.3%          Other   $ 6     $ 16       (63)%    Cost of sales  Cost of sales increased to 17.4% of product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2012, driven primarily by the Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 15.3% and 15.2% of product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Research and development  R&D expense for the three months ended March 31, 2012, included higher costs of $46 million associated with supporting our later stage clinical programs, including AMG 145, AMG 785 and talimogene laherparepvec. This increase was offset primarily by reduced expenses of $37 million in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences. The change in expenses related to marketed product support was not material during the three months ended March 31, 2012.  Selling, general and administrative  The increase in selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was driven principally by higher spending on marketed products of $39 million, related primarily to the launch of ENBREL and Prolia® direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns as well as international expansion, and by increased ENBREL profit share expenses of $25 million. These increases were offset partially by a favorable change to the estimated 2011 U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee of $42 million.  For the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share were $324 million and $299 million, respectively.  Non-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes  Non-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                    Three months endedMarch 31,        2012     2011     Interest expense, net   $ 235     $ 135     Interest and other income, net   $ 124     $ 148     Provisions for income taxes   $ 182     $ 181     Effective tax rate     13.3 %      13.9 %     28    Table of Contents Interest expense, net  The increase in interest expense, net, for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was due primarily to a higher average debt balance.  Interest and other income, net  The decrease in interest and other income, net, for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was due primarily to lower net realized gains on investments.  Income taxes  Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2012 was 13.3% compared with 13.9% for the corresponding period of the prior year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was due primarily to the favorable tax impact of changes in revenue and expense mix, the adjustment to the non-deductible healthcare reform federal excise fee, and higher tax credits in 2012 associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. These favorable impacts were partially offset by the exclusion of the benefit of the federal R&E tax credit in the three months ended March 31, 2012 (the federal R&E tax credit expired as of December 31, 2011 and was not reinstated as of March 31, 2012). Our effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 would have been 18.5% and 18.8%, respectively, without the impact of the foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax.  See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  Financial condition, liquidity and capital resources  Selected financial data was as follows (in millions):                    March 31,     December 31,        2012     2011     Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities   $ 19,374     $ 20,641     Total assets     49,250       48,871     Current portion of long-term debt     2,381       84     Long-term debt     19,028       21,344     Stockholders’ equity     18,874       19,029    The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers, as well as market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, Item 1A. Risk Factors — There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock). In October 2011, we announced our intent to accelerate our stock repurchase program, reflecting our confidence in the long-term value of the Company and the attractive interest rate environment. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, we repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.4 billion. We expect to repurchase the remaining $3.6 billion of stock under our authorized stock repurchase program through open-market purchases. In December 2011, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share of common stock, which was paid on March 7, 2012. On March 15, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share of common stock, which will be paid on June 7, 2012, to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 16, 2012.    29    Table of Contents We believe existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in each case for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as “U.S. funds”) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to repurchase stock and pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business.  A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent upon the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, customers outside the United States, which include government owned or supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent, in part, upon the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Deteriorating credit and economic conditions in parts of Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, may continue to increase the average length of time it takes to collect payments, particularly in certain regions within these countries. However, the timing of payments from government healthcare providers has not nor is it expected to have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows. To date we have not incurred any significant losses on collections of trade receivables from these government healthcare providers.  Over the next several years, many of the existing patents on our principal products will expire. As a result, we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars that may have a material adverse impact on our product sales, results of operations and liquidity. Upon patent expiration for small molecule products, there is typically intense competition from generics manufacturers, which generally leads to significant and rapid declines in sales of the branded product. Given that our principal products are biologics, we do not believe the impact of biosimilar competition will be as significant as with small molecule products, in part because successful competitors must have a broad range of specialized skills and capabilities unique to biologics, including significant regulatory, clinical and manufacturing expertise, and since the products are similar, but not identical, the biosimilars will have to compete against a product with an established efficacy and safety record. We have many opportunities to grow our business, including the continued commercialization of XGEVA® and Prolia® and expansion into emerging markets and Japan, which we believe may offset the adverse financial impact of our principal products’ patent expiries.  Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of March 31, 2012.  Cash flows  Our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions):                    Three months ended March 31,         2012       2011      Net cash provided by operating activities   $ 972     $ 1,030     Net cash used in investing activities     (2,346 )      (555 )    Net cash used in financing activities     (1,365 )      (2,496 )   Operating  Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2012, decreased due primarily to the timing and amount of payments to taxing authorities and others; offset partially by the timing and amount of receipts from customers and payments to vendors; and the impact of decreased inventory related expenditures.  Investing  Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2012, was due primarily to the acquisition of Micromet, net of cash acquired of $1.0 billion and net purchases of marketable securities of $1.2 billion. Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2011 was primarily for the acquisition of BioVex, net of cash acquired of $403    30    Table of Contents  million. Capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 totaled $144 million and $100 million, respectively. Capital expenditures during both the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, were associated primarily with manufacturing-capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and other site developments. We currently estimate 2012 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.  Financing  Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2012, was due primarily to the repurchases of our common stock of $1.4 billion; payment of dividends of $285 million; and repayment of $84 million of long-term debt, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the Company’s equity award program of $374 million. Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2011, was due primarily to the repayment of $2.5 billion of long-term debt.  See Note 9, Financing arrangements, and Note 10, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  Critical accounting policies  The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies in the three months ended March 31, 2012.    31    Table of Contents   Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Information about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, and is incorporated herein by reference. There have been no material changes for the three months ended March 31, 2012, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.      Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2012.  Management determined that, as of March 31, 2012, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    32    Table of Contents PART II — OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  See Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. These discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.      Item 1A.   RISK FACTORS  This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described the primary risks relating to our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, and periodically update those risks for material developments. These risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.  Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, provide additional disclosure and context for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.  Our marketed products face substantial competition.  In March 2012, the FDA approved peginesatide for treatment of anemia in adult dialysis patients with CKD. Peginesatide competes with our ESA products in the U.S. dialysis setting and may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.  Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.  In April 2012, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a review in which it identified the top five opportunities to improve the quality and value of cancer care by curbing use of common tests and treatments that are not supported by clinical evidence. Among ASCO’s suggestions in this review was that oncologists should avoid administering white blood cell stimulating factors (such as NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta®) to patients who have a very low risk for febrile neutropenia, a position consistent with ASCO’s existing guidelines for the use of white blood cell stimulating factors.  Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.  We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings and government investigations. (See Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this quarterly report.) As we announced in October 2011, we have reached an agreement in principle to settle certain allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices arising out of the ongoing civil and criminal investigations conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Offices for the Eastern District of New York and the Western District of Washington. We may also be subject to actions by governmental entities, including those not participating in the proposed settlement, and may in the future become subject to claims by other parties, in each case with respect to the alleged conduct which is the subject of this proposed settlement.    33    Table of Contents The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or of stolen or diverted products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.  Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet the exacting standards of our Company’s development, manufacturing and distribution processes that our products undergo. Counterfeit medicines pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially life-threatening. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit drugs sold under our brand name. In addition, products stolen from inventory, at warehouses, plants or while in transit or unlawfully diverted, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. Public loss of confidence in the integrity of biologics and/or pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.  We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure.  We are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems and infrastructure. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to the Company, its patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us.  Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate their operations may not be successful, and may result in costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions.  We have an ongoing process of evaluating potential merger, acquisition, partnering and in-license opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint, product offerings and/or our research and development pipeline. Such acquisitions may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may result in the diversion of our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. Failures or difficulties in integrating the operations of the businesses that we acquire, including their personnel, technology, financial systems, distribution and general business operations and procedures, may affect our ability to grow and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges.    34    Table of Contents   Item 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers, as well as market transactions.  During the three months ended March 31, 2012, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program. Our repurchase activity for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was as follows:         announced program     announced program     announced program     announced program                    Total number of     Maximum $ value        Total number     Average     shares purchased     that may yet be        of shares     price paid     as part of publicly     purchased under the        purchased     per share     announced program     program(1)     January 1 - January 31     2,163,000     $ 68.23       2,163,000     $ 4,845,481,260     February 1 - February 29     12,551,700       68.01       12,551,700       3,991,800,841     March 1 - March 31     6,331,800       67.62       6,331,800       3,563,534,376                                         21,046,500       67.92       21,046,500                                                 (1)  On October 13, 2011, our Board of Directors increased the authorization for repurchase of our common stock by $6.1 billion to an aggregate of $10 billion.
