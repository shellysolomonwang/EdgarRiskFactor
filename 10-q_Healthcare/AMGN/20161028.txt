Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.) We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could be significant in this Note; in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015; and in Note 13, Contingencies and commitments to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016, and June 30, 2016.We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.Our legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with thousands of putative class members. These legal proceedings, as well as other matters, involve various aspects of our business and a variety of claims—including but not limited to patent infringement, marketing, pricing and trade practices and securities law—some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. In each of the matters described in this filing or in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, or in Note 13, Contingencies and commitments to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, plaintiffs seek an award of a not-yet-quantified amount of damages or an amount that is not material. In addition, a number of the matters pending against us are at very early stages of the legal process (which in complex proceedings of the sort faced by us often extend for several years). As a result, none of the matters pending against us described in this filing, in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, or in Note 13, Contingencies and commitments to our 23condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, have progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate a range of possible loss, if any, or such amounts are not material. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these matters, an adverse determination in one or more of these matters currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings and other matters are discussed below:Sensipar® (cinacalcet) Patent LitigationAmgen filed 12 separate lawsuits in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the Delaware District Court) for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 9,375,405 (the ’405 Patent) against: (1) Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. and Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc., (2) MicroLabs Ltd. and Micro Labs USA, Inc., (3) Watson Laboratories, Inc., Actavis, Inc. and Actavis Pharma, Inc., and (4) Cipla Limited and Cipla USA, Inc., on September 22, 2016; (5) Strides Pharma Global PTE Limited and Strides Pharma, Inc., and (6) Sun Pharma Global FZE and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., on September 29, 2016; (7) Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd., and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc., and (8) Ajanta Pharma Limited and Ajanta Pharma USA, Inc., on October 5, 2016; and (9) Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC, and Amneal Pharmaceuticals Co.

On October 26, 2016, Cipla Limited and Cipla USA, Inc. responded to the complaint denying infringement and seeking judgment that the ’405 Patent is invalid and/or not infringed.AMJEVITA™ (adalimumab-atto) Patent LitigationOn August 4, 2016, AbbVie Inc. and AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd. (collectively, AbbVie) filed a lawsuit in the Delaware District Court against Amgen Inc. and Amgen Manufacturing, Ltd. (collectively, Amgen), alleging infringement of U.S Patent Nos. 8,663,945; 8,911,964; 8,916,157; 8,961,973; 8,986,693; 9,096,666; 9,220,781; 9,272,041; 9,359,434; and 9,365,645. AbbVie seeks an injunction prohibiting Amgen from commercializing ABP 501 (also known as AMJEVITA™, a biosimilar to AbbVie’s HUMIRA® (adalimumab)) prior to the expiration of the patents-in-suit and compelling Amgen to provide AbbVie with at least 180 days-notice of first commercial marketing. On September 13, 2016, Amgen responded to the complaint denying AbbVie’s allegations and counterclaimed, seeking judgment that the patents-in-suit are invalid and/or not infringed by Amgen. On September 23, 2016, the FDA approved AMJEVITA™. On October 7, 2016, AbbVie responded to Amgen’s counterclaims.KYPROLIS® (carfilzomib) Patent LitigationOur subsidiary Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. (Onyx Therapeutics), filed three separate lawsuits in the Delaware District Court against CIPLA Limited and CIPLA USA, Inc., on October 24, 2016; Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc., on October 26, 2016; and Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc., on October 27, 2016, for infringing U.S. Patent Nos. 7,232,818; 7,417,042; 7,491,704; 7,737,112; 8,129,346; 8,207,125; 8,207,126; 8,207,127; and 8,207,297. Onyx Therapeutics also filed a lawsuit in the Delaware District Court against MSN Laboratories Private Limited and MSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., on October 26, 2016, for infringing U.S. Patent No. 7,737,112. These lawsuits are based on abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) that seek approval to market generic versions of KYPROLIS® before expiration of the asserted patent or patents. In each lawsuit, Onyx Therapeutics seeks an order of the Delaware District Court making any FDA approval of the defendant’s ANDA effective no earlier than the expiration of all asserted patents.Other Biosimilar Patent LitigationsWe have filed a number of lawsuits against manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products. In each case, our complaint alleges that the manufacturer’s actions infringe certain patents we hold and/or that the manufacturer has failed to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA).Sandoz Pegfilgrastim LitigationOn June 23, 2016, Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz), a Novartis company, responded to Amgen’s patent infringement complaint denying infringement and seeking judgment that the patents-in-suit are not infringed and invalid.24Sandoz Filgrastim LitigationOn August 4, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered an order construing patent claim terms of our U.S. Patent Nos. 6,162,427 and 8,940,878.Sandoz Etanercept LitigationOn August 11, 2016, and subject to the terms of a confidential stipulation, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the New Jersey District Court) entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting Sandoz from making, using, importing, selling or offering for sale Sandoz’s etanercept product. A claim construction hearing is set for February 15, 2017, and trial is scheduled to start on April 17, 2018. On August 30, 2016, the FDA approved Sandoz’s Erelzi™ (etanercept-szzs), a biosimilar to Enbrel® (etanercept).Apotex Pegfilgrastim/Filgrastim LitigationOn September 9, 2016, Apotex petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for certiorari, seeking review of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Federal Circuit Court) holding that the 180-day notice of commercial marketing is mandatory under the BPCIA and can only be given post-FDA licensure of the biosimilar product.On September 16, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered final judgment that Apotex’s process of manufacturing its filgrastim and pegfilgrastim products do not infringe our U.S. Patent No. 8,952,138, dismissing without prejudice Apotex’s remaining invalidity counterclaim for patent invalidity, and making permanent the injunction compelling Apotex to provide 180-day advance notice of first commercial marketing of its filgrastim and pegfilgrastim products if and when the FDA approves these products. On October 3, 2016, Amgen filed an appeal of the final judgment to the Federal Circuit Court. Hospira Epoetin Alfa LitigationOn August 5, 2016, the Delaware District Court denied the motion filed by Hospira, Inc. (Hospira), a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc., to dismiss Amgen’s complaint which seeks a declaration that Hospira failed to comply with the commercial notice requirement of the BPCIA. On August 19, 2016, Hospira responded to the complaint denying the allegations of the First Amended Complaint and seeking judgment that the patents-in-suit are invalid and not infringed by Hospira. On August 15, 2016, Amgen moved to amend the First Amended Complaint to add additional bases for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 5,756,349 and to add three additional third-party defendants. On October 3, 2016, the Delaware District Court granted-in-part and denied-in-part Amgen’s motion to amend, permitting Amgen to add the additional bases for infringement but not the additional parties to the existing lawsuit. A claim construction hearing was held on September 21, 2016.On August 5, 2016, the Federal Circuit Court denied Hospira’s motion to dismiss Amgen’s appeal, which seeks review of the Delaware District Court’s order that Hospira need not provide Amgen discovery of certain of its manufacturing processes which information was withheld by Hospira during the BPCIA dispute resolution process.Onyx LitigationThe Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Mateo scheduled a November 18, 2016, hearing for final approval of the settlement between the plaintiffs and the former Onyx directors.Federal Securities Litigation—In re Amgen Inc.

Sharer, et al. case with prejudice.ERISA LitigationThe California Central District Court scheduled a November 21, 2016, hearing for preliminary approval of the settlement agreed to by the parties in this Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) class action case.25Item 2.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with GAAP. Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.Forward-looking statementsThis report and other documents we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we or others on our behalf may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume” and “continue,” as well as variations of such words and similar expressions, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II herein. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made.

Our product sales outside the United States consist principally of sales in Europe, and we continue to expand the commercialization and marketing of our products, including in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. 26Significant developmentsFollowing is a summary of selected significant developments affecting our business that have occurred since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016. For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.Products/PipelineBone HealthProlia® •In August 2016, we announced that the phase 3 randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Prolia® compared with risedronate in patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment met all primary and secondary endpoints at 12 months.Romosozumab•In September 2016, we and UCB, our collaboration partner in the development of romosozumab, announced that the FDA accepted for review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for romosozumab for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk for fracture. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date of July 19, 2017.XGEVA® •In October 2016, we announced that a phase 3 study evaluating XGEVA® versus Zometa® (zoledronic acid) in the prevention of skeletal-related events (SRE) in patients with multiple myeloma met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority in delaying the time to first on-study SRE. The secondary endpoints of superiority in delaying time to first SRE and delaying time to first-and-subsequent SRE were not met. CardiovascularRepatha® •In September 2016, we announced that the phase 3 GLAGOV (GLobal Assessment of Plaque ReGression with a PCSK9 AntibOdy as Measured by IntraVascular Ultrasound) study evaluating the effect of Repatha® on coronary artery disease met its primary and secondary endpoints.Oncology/HematologyBLINCYTO® •In September 2016, we announced that the FDA approved the supplemental BLA for BLINCYTO® to include new data supporting the treatment of pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. KYPROLIS® •In September 2016, we announced the top-line results of the phase 3 CLARION (Carfilzomib, Melphalan, Prednisone vs Bortezomib, Melphalan, Prednisone in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma) study, which evaluated an investigational regimen of KYPROLIS®, melphalan and prednisone versus Velcade® (bortezomib), melphalan and prednisone for 54 weeks in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were ineligible for hematopoietic stem-cell transplant. The study did not meet the primary endpoint of superiority in progression-free survival.NephrologyParsabiv™ (etelcalcetide)*•In August 2016, we announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the New Drug Application for Parsabiv™ for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis.•In September 2016, we announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion for the Marketing Authorization of Parsabiv™, recommending approval for the treatment of sHPT in adult patients with CKD on hemodialysis.* FDA provisionally approved trade name27NeuroscienceErenumab (formerly AMG 334)•In September 2016, we announced that the phase 3 ARISE (A phase 3, RandomIzed, double-blind, placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the efficacy and safety of erenumab in migraine prevention) study evaluating the efficacy of erenumab in episodic migraine prevention, met its primary endpoint. Erenumab is being developed in collaboration with Novartis AG (Novartis).BiosimilarsAMJEVITA™ (adalimumab-atto) (formerly ABP 501)•In September 2016, we announced that the FDA approved AMJEVITA™ across all eligible indications of the reference product, HUMIRA® (adalimumab), including treatment of psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (patients four years of age or older), chronic plaque psoriasis, adult Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.

The increase in global product sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was driven primarily by ENBREL, Prolia®, KYPROLIS®, Sensipar® and XGEVA®, partially offset by declines in EPOGEN®, NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta®.The increase in other revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was driven primarily by milestone payments received for licensing transactions and higher Ibrance® (palbociclib) royalty income. We receive an 8% royalty on Ibrance® sales.The decrease in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was driven by savings resulting from our transformation and process improvement efforts. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were flat, as increased investments in new product launches were offset by savings resulting from our transformation and process improvement efforts.The increases in net income and diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were driven by higher revenues and operating margins.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefits or detriments that such movements have on our international product sales are offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. By hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros, our hedging activities seek to offset both the positive and negative impacts that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income. The net impacts 28from changes in foreign currency exchange rates were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2016 2015 Change 2016 2015 ChangeENBREL$1,452 $1,459 — % $4,321 $3,923 10 %Neulasta®1,200 1,267 (5)% 3,532 3,559 (1)%Aranesp®531 493 8 % 1,567 1,452 8 %Prolia® 379 320 18 % 1,172 932 26 %Sensipar®/Mimpara®415 353 18 % 1,171 1,031 14 %XGEVA® 394 378 4 % 1,153 1,049 10 %EPOGEN®335 489 (31)% 966 1,514 (36)%NEUPOGEN®183 284 (36)% 592 786 (25)%Other products627 473 33 % 1,755 1,369 28 %Total product sales$5,516 $5,516 — % $16,229 $15,615 4 %Future sales of our products are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others. Such factors are discussed below and in the following sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015: (i) Overview, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products, (ii) Item 1A. Risk Factors and (iii) Item 7. Results of Operations—Product Sales; and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, in section Item 1A.

As of September 30, 2016, utilization of the Neulasta® OnPro™ kit continues to grow.Our final material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) expired in October 2015. Therefore, we expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on Neulasta®sales. Apotex, Sandoz (a Novartis company) and most recently in October 2016, Coherus BioSciences, Inc., announced that the FDA has accepted their applications for proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta®. Subsequently, Novartis has indicated that it received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA and expects to submit data from an additional study in 2018. For discussion of ongoing litigation between us and Apotex and Sandoz, see Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.In addition, supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, relating to our European patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) will expire in August 2017. For further information regarding our patents, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part I, Item 1.

The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was driven primarily by a decline in units resulting from competition and a shift by some U.S. dialysis customers to Aranesp®.Sequentially, EPOGEN® sales were relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the three months ended June 30, 2016, as the unit decline moderated and was offset by a favorable change in wholesaler inventory.Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN® expired in May 2015. There is competition in the United States, which has had a material adverse impact on EPOGEN® sales.

As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders. The efforts include a restructuring, which also is delivering cost savings and is funding investments.We continue to estimate that the restructuring will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $800 million to $900 million, of which $698 million was incurred through September 30, 2016. The charges that were recorded related to the restructuring during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were not significant. We expect that we will incur most of the remaining estimated costs through 2017 in order to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts.In 2016, we remain on track to meet or exceed an estimated $400 million in incremental benefits, versus 2015, from our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts with over three quarters of this savings achieved through September 30, 2016. These savings will enable continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities.Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 17.7% and 18.2% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The decreases were driven primarily by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling prices, offset partially by product mix.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 16.1% and 16.5% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with 16.4% and 17.8% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. See Note 4, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe decreases in R&D expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were driven by savings resulting from transformation and process improvement efforts, as well as by lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs. The decreases were offset partially by reinvestment for the long-term benefit of the Company, including increases in up-front payments for several in-licensing transactions.For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, costs associated with our later-stage clinical programs support decreased by $200 million and $765 million, respectively, offset by increased costs in marketed products support of $51 million and $538 million, respectively. Discovery Research and Translational Sciences spend was relatively unchanged for both periods. Prior to approval, costs related to our launch products were categorized largely as later-stage clinical programs.33Selling, general and administrativeSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, were flat. The increase in SG&A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was driven primarily by investments in new product launches and a $73 million charge related to an acquisition. Both periods benefited from transformation and process improvement efforts. OtherOther operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, included the impairment of a non-key contract asset acquired in a prior year business combination. Other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, also included legal proceeding charges of $105 million.Other operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, included a $32 million gain for the sale of assets related to our site closures and a decrease in the estimated aggregate fair value of a contingent consideration obligation of $18 million, offset partially by a $28 million charge associated with the write-off of a non-key contract asset acquired in a prior year business combination. The nine months ended September 30, 2015, also included certain charges related to our restructuring and other cost savings initiatives, primarily severance of $73 million and a legal proceeding charge of $71 million.Non-operating expenses/income and income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015Interest expense, net$325 $282 $932 $811Interest and other income, net$216 $135 $503 $439Provision for income taxes$401 $329 $1,093 $926Effective tax rate16.6% 15.0% 15.9% 15.3%Interest expense, netThe increases in Interest expense, net, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were due primarily to a higher average amount of fixed-rate debt outstanding.Interest and other income, netThe increases in Interest and other income, net, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were due primarily to higher interest income that resulted from higher average cash balances and net gains on sales of interest-bearing securities, offset partially by higher gains on sales of strategic equity investments in the prior year. Income taxes The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses.The increase in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and a state tax audit settlement in the prior year. The increase was offset partially by the adoption of a new accounting standard that amends certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based compensation payments and discrete benefits associated with tax incentives. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, would have been 19.4% and 18.8%, respectively, compared with 18.4% and 18.7% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.See Note 4, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.34Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$37,980 $31,382Total assets$78,150 $71,449Current portion of long-term debt$4,797 $2,247Long-term debt$30,526 $29,182Stockholders’ equity$30,773 $28,083We intend to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, in which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. In December 2015, March 2016 and July 2016, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.00 per share of common stock, which were paid on March 8, June 8 and September 8, 2016, respectively. In October 2016, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock, which will be paid on December 8, 2016.We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had stock repurchases of $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, $2.9 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program. In October 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase that resulted in a total of $5.0 billion available under the stock repurchase program.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively, U.S. funds) are adequate to continue meeting our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaling $38.0 billion as of September 30, 2016, approximately $34.4 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under this arrangement as of September 30, 2016.35Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Nine months ended September 30, 2016 2015Net cash provided by operating activities$7,254 $7,658Net cash used in investing activities$(7,436) $(5,314)Net cash used in financing activities$(477) $(2,849)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased compared with the same period in the prior year due primarily to the timing of payments to taxing authorities, accelerated inventory production costs and the monetization of foreign currency forward contracts in 2015, offset partially by increased net income.InvestingCash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $6.7 billion and capital expenditures of $511 million. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $4.8 billion and capital expenditures of $389 million, offset partially by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $271 million. Capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in various locations as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2016 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $2.3 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $2.0 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $254 million, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments, of $4.0 billion. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $1.8 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $1.7 billion, withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $394 million and the settlement of an obligation incurred in connection with the acquisition of Onyx of $225 million, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments, of $1.2 billion.See Note 9, Financing arrangements, and Note 10, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and is incorporated herein by reference. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsDuring the first quarter of 2016, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the entire principal amount of the debt denominated in euros and Swiss francs that we issued during this period. As of September 30, 2016, we had open cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion that effectively convert interest payments and principal 36repayment of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt securities to U.S. dollars and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 30, 2016, would result in a reduction in the aggregate fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $500 million, but would have no material effect on cash flows or income in the ensuing year.Foreign currency sensitive financial instrumentsAs of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a carrying value of $5.8 billion and a fair value of $6.5 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to exchange rates as of September 30, 2016, would result in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $1.3 billion and a reduction in income of approximately $1.2 billion but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis for this debt does not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the related cross-currency swap contracts which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt.With regard to our $5.6 billion notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros, pound sterling and Swiss francs, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to exchange rates as of September 30, 2016, would result in a reduction in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $1.3 billion but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The impact on income during this period from the above mentioned hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.Management determined that, as of September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, 37geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in Part II, Item 1A. our Quarterly Reports, on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, provide additional disclosure for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue aggressive initiatives to contain costs and manage drug utilization and are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom our products will be reimbursed by payers. Public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs is increasing and greater focus on pricing and price increases may limit our ability to set or increase the price of our products based upon their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from the U.S. federal government healthcare programs and private insurance plans regulated by the U.S. federal government. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part I, Item 1. Business—Reimbursement.) Changes to U.S. federal reimbursement policy may come through legislative actions such as The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. For example, discussions continue about proposals that would allow the U.S. federal government to directly negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers or require manufacturers to pay higher rebates in the Medicare Part D setting. Changes in U.S. federal reimbursement policy may also arise as a result of regulations or demonstration projects implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare, Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces. CMS has substantial power to quickly implement policy changes that can significantly affect how our products are covered and reimbursed. State government actions can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed or create additional pressure on how our products are priced. For example, a recently enacted Vermont law allows state healthcare regulators to identify certain drugs on which the state spends significant health care dollars and for which list prices rose by a certain percentage (which this year includes ENBREL) and to require the manufacturers to submit justifications of the price increases to the state attorney general. Many other states have discussed and debated and are considering new pricing legislation, including state proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information or to place a maximum price ceiling, or cap, on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies. For example, California voters will consider in the November 2016 election a ballot proposition that would prohibit the state from paying a greater price for drugs than the lowest price paid by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Passage of this California proposition could lead to the introduction of similar ballot initiatives in other states. Legislative or regulatory changes or other government initiatives that decrease the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates, limit our ability to offer commercial patient co-pay payment assistance or limit the pricing of pharmaceutical products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Payers, including healthcare insurers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and others, increasingly seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage. Consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers. Payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients, and some payers may attempt to limit the use of commercial patient co-pay payment assistance programs. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to our products, such as requiring prior authorizations or step therapy, and may choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely. For example, since the launch of Repatha® in August 2015, the application of utilization management criteria by some payers, including PBMs, has resulted in denials of coverage for a substantial number of patients for whom Repatha® has been prescribed, slowing Repatha® sales. In the current competitive environment, even if the phase 3 ongoing outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha® to prevent cardiovascular events meets its clinical endpoints, the application of restrictive utilization management criteria by some payers may continue until the clinical data is reflected in approved product labeling, or even thereafter. Ultimately, further discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products.We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products to U.S. government healthcare programs. Pricing data that we submit impacts the payment rates for providers, rebates we pay, and discounts we are required to provide under Medicare, Medicaid and other government drug programs. Government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. Our price reporting data calculations are reviewed on a monthly and quarterly basis, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated 38previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions and/or underlying data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.Outside the United States, we expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce their healthcare expenditures. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part I, Item 1. Business—Reimbursement.) For example, international reference pricing (IRP) is widely used by a large number of countries to control costs based on an external benchmark of a product’s price in other countries. IRP policies can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. Any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our products or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.Before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.) We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and therefore, we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. In addition, we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and subjects to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time, and privacy laws and/or other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further follow-up on such patients, which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results. Delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels.Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is limited, including Russia, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and complex clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit subjects and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with the applicable study protocols and laws and regulations. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. We also may acquire companies that have ongoing clinical trials. These trials may not be conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of the trial, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or the independent investigators selected by us or by a company we have acquired, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions which could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.In addition, some of our clinical trials involve drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in a clinical trial in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products’ or product candidates’ relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of their work or create a shortage of supply, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs, our ability to complete our applicable clinical 39trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. As a result, this could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide.Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In these diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer the current standards by the time such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or maintenance of our current product labels. Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could, among other factors, delay or terminate the clinical trial program and/or require additional or longer trials to gain approval.Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, in connection with the June 2011 erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) label changes, we also agreed to conduct additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in additional label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products, our business and results of operations.Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSDuring the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program and the repurchase activity was as follows: Total numberof sharespurchased Averageprice paidper share Total number ofshares purchasedas part of publicly announced program Maximum dollarvalue that mayyet be purchasedunder the program(1)July 1 - 31717,888 $162.08 717,888 $3,518,934,577August 1 - 311,857,289 $172.82 1,857,289 $3,197,956,578September 1 - 301,812,513 $170.93 1,812,513 $2,888,135,072 4,387,690 $170.28 4,387,690  (1)In October 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase that resulted in a total of $5.0 billion available under the stock repurchase program.Item 6.
