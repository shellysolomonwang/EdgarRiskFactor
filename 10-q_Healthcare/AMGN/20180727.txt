Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in this footnote; in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017; and in Note 14, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018.We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.Our legal proceedings involve various aspects of our business and a variety of claims—including but not limited to patent validity and infringement, regulatory standards, and other matters—some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. In each of the matters described in this filing, in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, or in Note 14, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2018, plaintiffs seek an award of a not-yet-quantified amount of damages or an amount that is not material. In addition, a number of the matters pending against us are at very early stages of the legal process, which in complex proceedings of the sort we face often extend for several years. As a result, none of the matters pending against us described in this filing, in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, or in Note 14, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2018, have progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or the development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate a range of possible loss, if any, or such amounts are not material. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these matters, an adverse determination in one or more of these matters currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings and other matters are discussed below:PCSK9 Antibody Patent LitigationU.S. Patent Litigation-Sanofi/RegeneronAs previously disclosed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied Amgen’s petition for rehearing en banc and issued a March 2, 2018 mandate returning the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the Delaware District Court) for a new trial on two of the defendants’ challenges to the validity of Amgen’s patents (lack of written description and enablement of the claimed inventions) and for further consideration of a permanent injunction. On July 23, 2018, Amgen filed a petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit conclusion that the judgment affirming the validity of Amgen’s patents was based, in part, on an erroneous application of the law of written description.Sensipar® (cinacalcet) LitigationSensipar® Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) Patent LitigationAs previously disclosed, the Delaware District Court held trial on the infringement claims and defenses in the Amgen Inc. v. Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. et al. consolidated lawsuit. Post-trial briefing on the infringement claims and defenses was completed on May 18, 2018.On June 12, 2018, the Delaware District Court entered an order dismissing the lawsuit filed in December 2017 against Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd. on stipulation between the parties and subject to the terms of a confidential settlement agreement.27In June 2018, Amgen filed lawsuits in the Delaware District Court and the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, each against Accord Healthcare, Inc. and Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (collectively, Accord) for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 9,375,405 (the ’405 Patent). In each lawsuit, Amgen seeks an order making any U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Accord’s generic version of Sensipar® effective no earlier than the expiration of the ’405 Patent in 2026.Sensipar® Pediatric Exclusivity LitigationAs previously disclosed, on February 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered final judgment for the FDA in the lawsuit filed by Amgen seeking effectively to reverse the FDA’s May 22, 2017 rejection of Amgen’s request for pediatric exclusivity for cinacalcet hydrochloride (Sensipar®/ Mimpara®). A grant of pediatric exclusivity by the FDA would have provided Amgen with an additional six months of exclusivity (i.e., through September 8, 2018) following the March 8, 2018 expiration of Amgen’s U.S. composition of matter patent. Oral arguments in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Amgen’s appeal of the final judgment took place on May 17, 2018.KYPROLIS® (carfilzomib) ANDA Patent LitigationDuring May, June and July of 2018, the Delaware District Court entered orders on stipulations between Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. (Onyx Therapeutics) and each of Fresenius Kabi, USA LLC and Fresenius Kabi USA, Inc.; Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc.; Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc.; Cipla Limited and Cipla USA, Inc. (collectively, Cipla); and Innopharma, Inc., respectively, that each defendant infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 7,417,042; 7,737,112 (the ’112 Patent); 8,207,125; 8,207,126; and 8,207,127. Onyx Therapeutics had previously provided those defendants a covenant that it would not assert patent infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,232,818; 7,491,704; 8,129,346; and 8,207,297 against certain of the respective defendants’ ANDA applications and products. On June 4, 2018, the Delaware District Court also entered an order on a stipulation between Onyx Therapeutics and MSN Laboratories Private Limited and MSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, MSN), that MSN infringes the ’112 Patent. In June and July 2018, the Delaware District Court consolidated for purposes of discovery into the existing consolidated case Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. v. Cipla Limited, et al., the lawsuits that were filed against Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. in December 2017; against Apotex Corp. and Apotex Inc. in January 2018; against Breckenridge Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in February 2018; and against Cipla in April 2018, respectively.NEUPOGEN® (filgrastim)/ Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) LitigationAdello NEUPOGEN® Patent LitigationAs previously disclosed, Amgen Inc. and Amgen Manufacturing Ltd. (collectively, Amgen) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Adello Biologics, LLC (Adello). On May 17, 2018, Adello responded to the lawsuit, denying infringement and seeking judgment that the patents-in-suit are invalid and not infringed.Coherus Neulasta® Patent LitigationAs previously disclosed, the Delaware District Court entered final judgment dismissing Amgen’s complaint against Coherus BioSciences, Inc. (Coherus) for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 8,273,707. On May 17, 2018, Amgen filed an appeal of the Delaware District Court’s judgment. Pfizer NEUPOGEN® Patent LitigationOn July 18, 2018, Amgen Inc. and Amgen Manufacturing Ltd. (collectively, Amgen) filed a lawsuit in the Delaware District Court against Pfizer Inc. and Hospira Inc. (collectively, Pfizer). This lawsuit stems from Pfizer’s submission of an application for FDA licensure of a filgrastim product as biosimilar to Amgen’s NEUPOGEN®. Amgen has asserted infringement of U.S. Patent No. 9,643,997 and seeks, among other remedies, injunctive relief to prohibit Pfizer from practicing the patented invention prior to the expiry of this patent.ENBREL (etanercept) LitigationCoherus ENBREL Patent ChallengeAs previously disclosed, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied Coherus’ petitions to institute inter partes review trial proceedings on U.S. Patent Nos. 8,163,522 and 8,063,182 and Coherus filed requests for rehearing on these two denied petitions. On July 13, 2018 the PTAB denied both requests for rehearing.MVASI™ (bevacizumab-awwb) Patent LitigationAs previously disclosed, Genentech, Inc. (Genentech) and City of Hope filed lawsuits in the Delaware District Court alleging infringement of a number of patents listed by Genentech in the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) exchange 28by MVASI™, Amgen’s biosimilar version of Avastin® (bevacizumab), and for non-compliance with certain provisions of the BPCIA. On June 5, 2018, Amgen responded to the complaint denying patent infringement and any violation of the BPCIA and seeking judgment that the patents-in-suit are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed by Amgen. On June 19, 2018, Genentech and City of Hope moved to dismiss all of Amgen’s counterclaims and certain of Amgen’s defenses.KANJINTI™ (trastuzumab) Patent LitigationOn June 21, 2018, Genentech and City of Hope filed a lawsuit in the Delaware District Court alleging Amgen’s infringement of 37 patents by Amgen’s submission of an application for FDA licensure of KANJINTI™, Amgen’s biosimilar version of Genentech’s Herceptin® (trastuzumab). On July 19, 2018, Genentech, City of Hope and Amgen filed a joint stipulation to dismiss certain of the patents from the lawsuit and Genentech and City of Hope filed an amended complaint narrowing its allegations of infringement to 18 of the 37 patents. Among other remedies, Genentech and City of Hope seek injunctive relief prohibiting patent infringement.29Item 2.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business.

For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018.Products/Pipeline Bone healthProlia®  •In May 2018 and June 2018, the FDA and the European Commission (EC), respectively, approved a new indication for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in adult patients at high risk of fracture. Both approvals were based on data from a phase 3 study, which showed patients on glucocorticoid therapy who received Prolia® had greater gains in bone mineral density compared to those who received the active comparator risedronate. EVENITYTM (romosozumab)*  •In July 2018, we announced the resubmission of the Biologics License Application to the FDA for EVENITYTM, an investigational monoclonal antibody for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture. 30CardiovascularRepatha® •In May 2018, we announced that the EC approved a new indication in the Repatha® label for adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial disease) to reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. NeuroscienceAimovigTM •In May 2018, we announced that the FDA approved AimovigTM for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. We are in collaboration with Novartis on the development and commercialization of AimovigTM.  Oncology/HematologyBLINCYTO® •In June 2018, we announced that the EC granted a full marketing authorization for BLINCYTO® based on the overall survival data from the phase 3 TOWER study in adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. KYPROLIS® •In April 2018, we announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion recommending a label variation for KYPROLIS® to include the final overall survival data from the phase 3 ASPIRE (CArfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and DexamethaSone versus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for the treatment of PatIents with Relapsed Multiple MyEloma) study. The ASPIRE study demonstrated that the addition of KYPROLIS® to lenalidomide and dexamethasone reduced the risk of death by 21% versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone and extended overall survival by 7.9 months in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In June 2018, we announced that the FDA approved the supplemental New Drug Application to add the positive overall survival data from the phase 3 ASPIRE study to the U.S. Prescribing Information for KYPROLIS®. •In June 2018, we presented results from the phase 3 ARROW (RAndomized, Open-label, Phase 3 Study in Subjects with Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma Receiving Carfilzomib in Combination with Dexamethasone, Comparing Once-Weekly versus Twice-weekly Carfilzomib Dosing) study of a once-weekly KYPROLIS® dosing regimen in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In the study, KYPROLIS® administered once-weekly at 70 mg/m2 with dexamethasone achieved superior progression-free survival and overall response rates, with a comparable safety profile, versus twice-weekly KYPROLIS® at 27 mg/m2 and dexamethasone.BiosimilarsKANJINTITM* (formerly ABP 980)•In May 2018, the EC granted marketing authorization for KANJINTITM, a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin®, for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, HER2-positive early breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction.•In May 2018, we announced that we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for the Biologics License Application for KANJINTITM. ABP 710•In June 2018, we announced results from a phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of biosimilar candidate ABP 710 compared with REMICADE® (infliximab) in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. The results confirm noninferiority compared to infliximab but could not rule out superiority based on its primary efficacy endpoint. *FDA conditionally approved trade name31Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data): Three months endedJune 30,   Six months endedJune 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeProduct sales           U.S.$4,367 $4,386 — % $8,514 $8,481 — %ROW1,312 1,188 10 % 2,508 2,292 9 %Total product sales5,679 5,574 2 % 11,022 10,773 2 %Other revenues380 236 61 % 591 501 18 %Total revenues$6,059 $5,810 4 % $11,613 $11,274 3 %Operating expenses$3,227 $3,112 4 % $6,055 $5,985 1 %Operating income$2,832 $2,698 5 % $5,558 $5,289 5 %Net income$2,296 $2,151 7 % $4,607 $4,222 9 %Diluted EPS$3.48 $2.91 20 % $6.73 $5.71 18 %Diluted shares660 738 (11)% 685 740 (7)%In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers (such as physicians or their clinics), dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.Total product sales increased for the three months ended June 30, 2018, driven primarily by higher unit demand, offset partially by unfavorable changes in inventory. Total product sales increased for the six months ended June 30, 2018, driven primarily by higher unit demand. The increases in total product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, have not benefited from net selling price.Other revenues increased for the three months ended June 30, 2018, driven primarily by a milestone payment received from Novartis. Other revenues increased for the six months ended June 30, 2018, driven primarily by higher milestone payments and higher Ibrance® (palbociclib) royalty income.Operating expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, driven primarily by higher investments in product launches and marketed product support, offset partially by decreased Other expenses. All expense categories continued to benefit from our transformation and process improvement efforts, which enabled investment in newer and recently launched products.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.32Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedJune 30,   Six months endedJune 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeENBREL$1,302 $1,466 (11)% $2,407 $2,647 (9)%Neulasta®1,100 1,087 1 % 2,255 2,297 (2)%Prolia® 610 505 21 % 1,104 930 19 %Aranesp®472 535 (12)% 926 1,046 (11)%Sensipar®/Mimpara®420 427 (2)% 917 848 8 %XGEVA® 452 395 14 % 897 797 13 %EPOGEN®250 292 (14)% 494 562 (12)%Other products1,073 867 24 % 2,022 1,646 23 %Total product sales$5,679 $5,574 2 % $11,022 $10,773 2 %Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed below and in the following sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017: (i) Overview, Item 1.

The decrease in ENBREL sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018, was driven primarily by lower unit demand and a decline in net selling price. For 2018, we expect the trend of lower unit demand to continue. In addition, we expect the 2018 net selling price to decline slightly compared with 2017.Neulasta® Total Neulasta® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedJune 30,   Six months endedJune 30,   2018 2017 Change  2018 2017 ChangeNeulasta®— U.S.$948 $937 1% $1,957 $1,985 (1)%Neulasta®— ROW152 150 1% 298 312 (4)%Total Neulasta®$1,100 $1,087 1% $2,255 $2,297 (2)%The increase in global Neulasta® sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018, was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in inventory, offset partially by lower unit demand. The decrease in global Neulasta® sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018, was driven primarily by lower unit demand and favorable prior-period changes in accounting estimates, offset partially by an increase in net selling price.33Neulasta® sales have been and will continue to be affected by the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new treatment alternatives, including those that have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of myelosuppressive regimens in some patients.Our final material U.S. patent for Neulasta® expired in October 2015. Therefore, we expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Neulasta®. A biosimilar version of Neulasta® was approved in the second quarter of 2018 and launched in July 2018. Other biosimilar versions of Neulasta® may also receive approval in the second half of 2018. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigations with these and other companies that are developing proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta®, see Note 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements, Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and Note 14, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018.In addition, supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, that are related to our European patent for Neulasta® expired in August 2017.Prolia® Total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedJune 30,   Six months endedJune 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeProlia® — U.S.$396 $326 21% $716 $605 18%Prolia® — ROW214 179 20% 388 325 19%Total Prolia®$610 $505 21% $1,104 $930 19%The increases in global Prolia® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, were driven primarily by higher unit demand and, to a lesser extent, higher net selling price. Prolia®, which has a six-month dosing interval, has exhibited a historical sales pattern, with the first and third quarters of a year representing lower sales than the second and fourth quarters of a year.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedJune 30,   Six months endedJune 30,   2018 2017 Change  2018 2017 ChangeAranesp® — U.S.$241 $288 (16)% $466 $566 (18)%Aranesp® — ROW231 247 (6)% 460 480 (4)%Total Aranesp®$472 $535 (12)% $926 $1,046 (11)%The decreases in global Aranesp® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, were driven primarily by the impact of competition on unit demand and, to a lesser extent, lower net selling price. Aranesp® faces competition from a long-acting product. We could also face competition from biosimilar versions of EPOGEN®. A biosimilar version of EPOGEN® was approved in the second quarter of 2018 and may launch. Other biosimilar versions of EPOGEN® may also receive approval. Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedJune 30,   Six months endedJune 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeSensipar® — U.S.$330 $342 (4)% $739 $679 9%Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW90 85 6 % 178 169 5%Total Sensipar®/Mimpara®$420 $427 (2)% $917 $848 8%34The decrease in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018, was driven primarily by unfavorable changes in inventory and lower unit demand as a result of a shift to ParsabivTM, offset partially by higher net selling price. The increase in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018, was driven primarily by higher unit demand and increases in net selling price and inventory. There was a shift in reimbursement from U.S. Medicare Part D to Part B at the beginning of 2018, and providers may have ordered additional supply in the first quarter of 2018 in order to ensure patient treatment was not interrupted. Our U.S. composition of matter patent related to Sensipar®, a small molecule, expired in March 2018. We are also involved in a number of litigation matters related to Sensipar®, including patent litigations with a number of companies seeking to market generic versions of Sensipar® and litigation regarding our request for pediatric exclusivity for Sensipar®. See Note 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements, Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and Note 14, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018. The 2018 outlook for Sensipar® is uncertain as generic competitors may enter the market at risk in the second half of 2018.XGEVA®  Total XGEVA® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedJune 30,   Six months endedJune 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeXGEVA® — U.S.$339 $292 16% $671 $590 14%XGEVA® — ROW113 103 10% 226 207 9%Total XGEVA®$452 $395 14% $897 $797 13%The increases in global XGEVA® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, were driven primarily by higher unit demand and, to a lesser extent, higher net selling price.EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedJune 30,   Six months endedJune 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeEPOGEN® — U.S.$250 $292 (14)% $494 $562 (12)%The decreases in EPOGEN® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, were driven primarily by a decrease in net selling price due to contractual terms negotiated with DaVita Inc. and, to a lesser extent, lower unit demand. Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN® expired in May 2015. We face competition in the United States, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of EPOGEN®. Multiple companies are developing proposed biosimilar versions of EPOGEN®. A biosimilar version of EPOGEN® was approved in the second quarter of 2018 and may launch. Other biosimilar versions of EPOGEN® may also receive approval. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigation with one of these companies, see Note 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.35Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedJune 30,   Six months endedJune 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeKYPROLIS®— U.S.$151 $140 8 % $288 $277 4 %KYPROLIS®— ROW112 71 58 % 197 124 59 %Nplate®— U.S.107 99 8 % 219 196 12 %Nplate®— ROW72 65 11 % 139 122 14 %Vectibix®— U.S.68 62 10 % 143 123 16 %Vectibix®— ROW105 106 (1)% 199 192 4 %Repatha®— U.S.98 60 63 % 182 93 96 %Repatha®— ROW50 23 * 89 39 *NEUPOGEN®— U.S.63 90 (30)% 128 191 (33)%NEUPOGEN®— ROW39 47 (17)% 77 94 (18)%ParsabivTM — U.S.66 — * 102 — *ParsabivTM — ROW7 — * 12 — *BLINCYTO® — U.S.34 28 21 % 64 51 25 %BLINCYTO® — ROW26 15 73 % 45 26 73 %Other — U.S.24 19 26 % 43 34 26 %Other — ROW51 42 21 % 95 84 13 %Total other products$1,073 $867 24 % $2,022 $1,646 23 %Total U.S. — other products$611 $498 23 % $1,169 $965 21 %Total ROW — other products462 369 25 % 853 681 25 %Total other products$1,073 $867 24 % $2,022 $1,646 23 %* Change in excess of 100%.Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedJune 30,   Six months endedJune 30,   2018 2017 Change  2018 2017 ChangeOperating expenses:           Cost of sales$1,024 $1,024 —% $1,968 $2,020 (3)%% of product sales18.0% 18.4%   17.9% 18.8%  % of total revenues16.9% 17.6%   16.9% 17.9%  Research and development$869 $873 —% $1,629 $1,642 (1)%% of product sales15.3% 15.7%   14.8% 15.2%  % of total revenues14.3% 15.0%   14.0% 14.6%  Selling, general and administrative$1,353 $1,209 12% $2,480 $2,273 9 %% of product sales23.8% 21.7%   22.5% 21.1%  % of total revenues22.3% 20.8%   21.4% 20.2%  Other$(19) $6 * $(22) $50 ** Change in excess of 100%.36Transformation and process improvementsDuring 2014, we announced transformation and process improvement efforts that we continue to execute. As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders.The transformation includes a restructuring plan that we estimate will result in pretax accounting charges in the range of $800 million to $900 million. As of June 30, 2018, restructuring costs incurred to date were $794 million. The charges that were recorded related to the restructuring during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, were not significant. Since 2014, we have realized approximately $1.6 billion of transformation and process improvement savings. Net savings have not been significant as savings were reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 16.9% of total revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, driven primarily by lower royalty costs and a decrease in acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets, offset partially by higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable product mix.Research and developmentR&D expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018, were relatively flat as a decrease in marketed-product support of $70 million was offset by increases in later-stage clinical programs of $37 million and Discovery Research and Translation Sciences of $32 million. R&D expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018, were relatively flat as a decrease in marketed-product support of $77 million was offset by increases in later-stage clinical programs of $31 million and Discovery Research and Translation Sciences of $36 million.Selling, general and administrativeThe increases in Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, were driven primarily by investments in product launches and marketed product support.OtherOther operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, decreased due primarily to the change in fair values of contingent consideration liabilities related to business combinations and lower net charges related to our restructuring plan, offset partially by expenses related to legal proceedings. Nonoperating expense/income and income taxesNonoperating expense/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedJune 30, Six months endedJune 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017Interest expense, net$347 $321 $685 $647Interest and other income, net$162 $165 $393 $360Provision for income taxes$351 $391 $659 $780Effective tax rate13.3% 15.4% 12.5% 15.6%Interest expense, netThe increase in Interest expense, net, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, was due primarily to the impact of rising interest rates on debt on which we pay variable rates of interest.Interest and other income, netThe slight decrease in Interest and other income, net for the three months ended June 30, 2018, was due primarily to higher net investment losses and reduced returns as a result of the liquidation of a portion of our portfolio, substantially offset by gains recognized on our equity investments, principally as a result of the adoption of a new accounting standard in the current year that changed prospectively the accounting for equity investments (see Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, to the 37condensed consolidated financial statements). The increase in Interest and other income, net, for the six months ended June 30, 2018, was due primarily to a net gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of K-A (see Note 3, Business combinations, to the condensed consolidated financial statements) and gains on our equity investments, offset partially by net investment losses recognized as a result of the liquidation of a portion of our portfolio.Income taxes The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, was due primarily to the impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform, offset partially by a prior year benefit associated with the effective settlement of certain state and federal tax matters.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the 2017 Tax Act, which imposes a repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, implements a hybrid territorial tax system together with a current tax on certain foreign earnings and lowers the general corporate income tax rate to 21%. In March 2018, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to incorporate SAB 118, which permits us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We continue to analyze the 2017 Tax Act and in certain areas have made reasonable estimates of the effects on our condensed consolidated financial statements and tax disclosures.The 2017 Tax Act includes U.S. taxation on foreign intangible income, effective January 1, 2018. The FASB allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as foreign intangible income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to the foreign intangible income as a period expense in the year it is incurred. We have recorded no provisional amount for deferred taxes on foreign intangible income because more time is needed to analyze the data in order to make an accounting policy election.We consider our key estimates on the repatriation tax, the net deferred tax remeasurement, the impact on our unrealized tax benefits and the accounting policy election on temporary basis differences related to foreign intangible income to be incomplete due to our continuing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We are still accumulating and processing data to update our underlying calculations, and we expect the U.S. Treasury and regulators may issue further guidance, among other things; therefore, our estimates may change during 2018. However, we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period.As previously disclosed, we received an RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. On November 29, 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRS calculations but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution through the IRS administrative appeals process, which we believe will likely not be concluded within the next 12 months. Final resolution of the IRS audit could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows if not resolved favorably, however, we believe our income tax reserves are appropriately provided for all open tax years. See Note 5, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$29,395 $41,678Total assets$67,684 $79,954Current portion of long-term debt$4,288 $1,152Long-term debt$30,209 $34,190Stockholders’ equity$14,909 $25,241Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesWe have global access to our $29 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as we no longer reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely outside the United States. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we recorded a repatriation tax liability on undistributed earnings generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions estimated at $7.3 billion, that will be paid over eight years. The first annual payment was made in April 2018.The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security 38investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Capital allocationConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we seek to deploy our accumulated cash balances in an efficient manner, and we consider several alternatives such as share repurchases, payment of cash dividends, repayment of debt and strategic transactions that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest. We intend to continue to invest in our business and return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by stock price and blackout periods during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.In March 2018 and December 2017, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.32 per share of common stock, which were paid on March 8, 2018 and June 8, 2018.We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we repurchased $14.0 billion of our stock and paid $13.9 billion in cash during the period, which included 52.1 million shares of common stock repurchased through a $10.0 billion tender offer. In April 2018, our Board of Directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by an additional $5.0 billion. As of June 30, 2018, $5.4 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program.As a result of stock repurchases, including our recent tender offer, and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Our accumulated deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Certain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant, which was modified during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The modified covenant requires that we maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA) to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the amended credit agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of June 30, 2018.Cash flowsOur summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): Six months endedJune 30, 2018 2017Net cash provided by operating activities$4,829 $4,711Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$17,844 $(1,970)Net cash used in financing activities$(16,342) $(3,353)39OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2018, increased compared with the same period in the prior year due primarily to higher net income, offset partially by higher cash taxes resulting from the first installment payment of repatriation tax arising from the 2017 Tax Act, net of reduced payments on our ongoing income tax liability.InvestingCash provided by investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2018, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $18.0 billion, offset partially by capital expenditures of $342 million. Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2017, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $1.5 billion and capital expenditures of $353 million. Capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, were associated primarily with manufacturing-capacity expansions in various locations, as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2018 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $750 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2018, was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $13.9 billion, payment of dividends of $1.8 billion and repayment of debt of $500 million. Cash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2017, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $1.7 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $1.6 billion and repayment of long-term debt, net of proceeds from debt issuances, of $920 million, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper of $959 million. See Note 12, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, under different assumptions or conditions, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2018.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and is incorporated herein by reference. There have been no material changes during the six months ended June 30, 2018, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2018.Management determined that, as of June 30, 2018, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.40PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2018 and Note 14, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, provide additional disclosure for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability.Sales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue initiatives to contain costs and manage drug utilization. These payers are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result for our products in lower reimbursement rates or narrower populations for whom payers will reimburse. Continued intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs, together with payer dynamics, may limit our ability to set or adjust the price of our products based on their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In the United States, the public discussions of drug pricing issues are likely to continue.A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from U.S. federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by the U.S. federal and state governments. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Part I, Item 1. Business—Reimbursement. Changes to U.S. federal reimbursement policy may come through legislative and/or administrative actions. For example, in February 2018, the U.S. Congress passed legislation that requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay greater discounts for patients in the Medicare Part D coverage gap beginning in 2019, which may reduce our net product sales relating to such patients. In May 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration released a drug pricing “blueprint” and requested public comment on an array of policy ideas intended to increase competition, improve the negotiating power of the federal government, reduce drug prices and lower patient out-of-pocket costs. The blueprint included a number of policy ideas with the potential to significantly impact our industry, whether individually or collectively, including proposals to move reimbursement for all Medicare Part B drugs into Medicare Part D and to remove the safe-harbor protection under the federal anti-kickback statute for drug rebates paid to payers. Prior to the release of the drug pricing blueprint, other legislative proposals had been introduced into the U.S. Congress to overhaul provisions of the ACA and to enable commercial-level re-importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries. Changes in U.S. federal reimbursement policy may also arise as a result of executive actions, federal regulations, or demonstration projects implemented by federal agencies including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare, Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces. CMS has substantial power to implement policy changes or demonstration projects that can quickly and significantly affect how our products are covered and reimbursed. CMS has already begun implementing certain elements described in the administration’s drug pricing blueprint, including warning Medicare Part D plan insurers that they could face compliance actions if they implement contractual “gag clauses” to prevent pharmacies from alerting patients to lower priced cash payment options. CMS has also undertaken other projects to test care models, such as the CMS Oncology Care Model that provides participating physician practices with performance-based financial incentives that aim 41to manage or reduce Medicare costs without negatively impacting the efficacy of care. We believe the Oncology Care Model has negatively impacted utilization of certain of our oncology products by participating physician practices and may continue to do so in the future. CMS has also solicited suggestions regarding other potential care models. President Trump’s administration is also seeking to address drug prices through other federal agency actions. For example, to promote greater drug price competition, the FDA is pursuing policies that would ease generic and biosimilar entry requirements, including the lowering of standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability. While we are unable to predict if these policy, legislative or regulatory changes may ultimately be enacted, to the extent that these or other federal government initiatives decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates or shift other costs to us, limit our ability to offer co-pay payment assistance to commercial patients, limit or impact our decisions regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products or reduce the use of our U.S. products, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.At the state level, government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed and/or create additional pressure on our pricing decisions. A number of states have adopted, and many other states have discussed and debated and are considering, new pricing legislation, including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information, limit price increases or to place a maximum price ceiling or cap on pharmaceutical products. For example, in October 2017, California enacted a drug pricing transparency bill that requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before scheduled prescription drug price increases that exceed certain thresholds. These existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be impacting industry pricing decisions. Ultimately, as with U.S. federal government actions, existing or future state government actions may also have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Payers, including healthcare insurers, Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek ways to reduce their and their respective members’ costs. Many payers continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient co-pay or co-insurance obligations and limitations on patients’ use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs). Payers have sought and will likely continue to seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage, particularly in treatment areas where the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as by requiring prior authorizations or step therapy, and may choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely. For example, the burdensome administrative process required for physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha® has been prescribed meet the payers’ utilization management criteria has limited patient access to Repatha® treatment. Even with increased access, patient out-of-pocket expense may limit patient use. For example, other patients with coverage for Repatha® have abandoned their prescriptions rather than pay their co-pay payment. In an effort to reduce access burdens, we have taken a number of actions to reduce the net price of Repatha® through offering greater discounts and rebates to payers. Despite the recent net price reductions, payers may continue to impose access burdens, change formulary coverage for Repatha®, seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions that could reduce our sales of Repatha®.Significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantly increasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage. For example, in the United States, the top three PBMs now oversee more than 70% of prescription claims and the top three health insurance companies’ coverage is approaching half of government and commercial covered lives. Consolidation between pharmacies is also increasing, with the top three pharmacies now responsible for half of U.S. drug sales. Consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including through integrated delivery systems and/or with specialty pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers and has resulted in greater price discounts on our products, fees for other services and rebates. Further consolidation (including as a result of a number of merger transactions that have been announced but not yet completed) would increase this leverage. Ultimately, further discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products.Outside the United States, we expect countries will continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Part I, Item 1. Business—Reimbursement. For example, international reference pricing (IRP) is widely used by a large number of countries to control costs based on an external benchmark of a product’s price in other countries. IRP policies can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. Any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our products or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or could otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.42We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. In the United States, pricing data that we submit to the U.S. government impacts the payment rates for providers, rebates we pay, and discounts we are required to provide under Medicare, Medicaid and other government drug programs. Government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. Our price reporting data calculations are reviewed monthly and quarterly, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions and/or underlying data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSDuring the three months ended June 30, 2018, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program, under which the repurchase activity was as follows: Total numberof sharespurchased Averageprice paidper share (1) Total numberof shares purchasedas part of publicly announced program Maximum dollarvalue that mayyet be purchasedunder the program (2)April 1 - 307,368,600 $171.94 7,368,600 $7,313,546,088May 1 - 317,365,100 $173.00 7,365,100 $6,039,390,454June 1 - 303,502,600 $184.52 3,502,600 $5,393,102,210 18,236,300 $174.78 18,236,300  (1) Average price paid per share includes related expenses.(2) In April 2018, our Board of Directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by an additional $5.0 billion.Item 6.
