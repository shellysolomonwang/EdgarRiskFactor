Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7 – Product Sales in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.23Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2013 2012 Change  2013 2012 Change Neulasta®— U.S.$897 $794 13 % $1,724 $1,608 7 %Neulasta®— ROW223 221 1 % 435 446 (2)%Total Neulasta®1,120 1,015 10 % 2,159 2,054 5 %NEUPOGEN®— U.S.267 268 — % 509 507 — %NEUPOGEN®— ROW57 64 (11)% 114 130 (12)%Total NEUPOGEN®324 332 (2)% 623 637 (2)%Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®$1,444 $1,347 7 % $2,782 $2,691 3 %The increase in global Neulasta® sales for the three months ended June 30, 2013, was driven by an increase in the average net sales price, an increase in wholesaler inventory and the Medicaid rebate adjustment, offset partially by a decline in units.The increase in global Neulasta® sales for the six months ended June 30, 2013, was driven by an increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by a decline in units.The decreases in global NEUPOGEN® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, were driven by decreases in unit demand, offset partially by increases in the average net sales price and the Medicaid rebate adjustment.Our outstanding material U.S. patents for filgrastim (NEUPOGEN®) expire in December 2013. We expect to face competition in the United States beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, which may have a material adverse impact over time on sales of NEUPOGEN® and, in turn, Neulasta®. Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) expires in 2015.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2013 2012 Change  2013 2012 Change ENBREL — U.S.$1,089 $991 10% $2,063 $1,869 10%ENBREL — Canada68 67 1% 133 127 5%Total ENBREL$1,157 $1,058 9% $2,196 $1,996 10%The increases in ENBREL sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, were driven primarily by increases in the average net sales price, offset partially by slight unit declines. ENBREL sales for the six months ended June 30, 2013, were also impacted by a favorable change in estimated product return accruals in the first quarter of 2013.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2013 2012 Change  2013 2012 Change Aranesp® — U.S.$228 $215 6 % $396 $417 (5)%Aranesp® — ROW296 321 (8)% 596 637 (6)%Total Aranesp®$524 $536 (2)% $992 $1,054 (6)%The increase in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the three months ended June 30, 2013, was due to the Medicaid rebate adjustment, offset partially by a decline in units. The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the six months ended June 30, 2013, was driven by a decline in units, offset partially by the Medicaid rebate adjustment and an increase in the average net sales price.24The decreases in ROW Aranesp® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, were driven by unit declines and, to a lesser extent, decreases in the average net sales price.Sequentially, excluding the Medicaid rebate adjustment, global Aranesp® sales were flat in the quarter ended June 30, 2013, compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2013. In the United States, demand appears to be trending slightly downward driven by dose reductions. In Europe, we are seeing continued pressure from pricing cuts and competition.EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2013 2012 Change  2013 2012 Change EPOGEN® — U.S.$502 $525 (4)% $937 $971 (4)%EPOGEN® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, declined 4%. Sequentially, sales increased 15% in the quarter ended June 30, 2013, compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2013, driven by unit growth due to our competitor's peginesatide being removed from the market in the first quarter of 2013 and, to a lesser extent, the Medicaid rebate adjustment.XGEVA® and Prolia®  Total XGEVA® and total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2013 2012 Change  2013 2012 Change XGEVA® — U.S.$189 $156 21% $367 $295 24%XGEVA® — ROW60 23 * 105 37 *Total XGEVA®249 179 39% 472 332 42%Prolia® — U.S.118 75 57% 205 129 59%Prolia® — ROW70 45 56% 125 79 58%Total Prolia®188 120 57% 330 208 59%Total XGEVA®/Prolia®$437 $299 46% $802 $540 49%* Change in excess of 100%The increases in global XGEVA® and Prolia® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 were driven by unit growth reflecting increased segment share.Sequentially, global XGEVA® increased 12% in the quarter ended June 30, 2013, compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2013, due to unit growth. Global Prolia® sales increased 32% during that same period due to increased segment share, partially driven by seasonality.25Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2013 2012 Change  2013 2012 Change Sensipar® — U.S.$178 $150 19 % $357 $290 23 %Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW81 82 (1)% 166 161 3 %Vectibix® — U.S.31 31 — % 58 62 (6)%Vectibix® — ROW62 59 5 % 122 118 3 %Nplate® — U.S.62 50 24 % 117 104 13 %Nplate® — ROW43 36 19 % 84 72 17 %Other — ROW74 27 * 133 42 *Total other products$531 $435 22 % $1,037 $849 22 %Total U.S. — other products$271 $231 17 % $532 $456 17 %Total ROW — other products260 204 27 % 505 393 28 %Total other products$531 $435 22 % $1,037 $849 22 %* Change in excess of 100%Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2013 2012 Change  2013 2012 Change Cost of sales$785 $752 4% $1,529 $1,502 2%% of product sales17.1% 17.9%   17.5% 18.5%  Research and development$967 $826 17% $1,845 $1,562 18%% of product sales21.0% 19.7%   21.1% 19.3%  Selling, general and administrative$1,256 $1,231 2% $2,414 $2,310 5%% of product sales27.3% 29.3%   27.6% 28.5%  Other$121 $79 53% $137 $85 61%Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 17.1% and 17.5% of product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, driven by lower royalties and higher average net sales prices, offset by changes in product mix. The excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico also contributed to the decreases as the tax rate declined from 4.0% in 2011 to 3.75% in 2012 and 2.75% in 2013. However, changes to the law have increased the rate effective July 1, 2013, back to 4.0%.Excluding the impact of the excise tax, cost of sales would have been 15.5% and 15.6% of product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared with 15.9% and 16.5% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe increases in R&D expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, were driven primarily by increased costs associated with supporting later-stage clinical programs, including AMG 145, of $123 million and $231 million, respectively; and increases in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities of $16 million and $65 million, respectively. Expenses associated with marketed product support increased $2 million and decreased $13 million, respectively.26Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)The increase in SG&A expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2013, was driven by higher ENBREL profit share expenses of $54 million.The increase in SG&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2013, was driven by higher ENBREL profit share expenses of $108 million as well as $49 million that was related primarily to a favorable change to the estimated U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee in the prior year.Under our ENBREL collaboration agreement, we currently pay Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada attributable to all approved indications for ENBREL on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, we maintain a majority share of ENBREL profits. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share were $425 million and $803 million, respectively, compared with $371 million and $695 million for the corresponding periods of the prior year. After expiration of the co-promotion term on October 31, 2013, we will be required to pay Pfizer residual royalties, which are anticipated to be significantly less than what would be owed based on the terms of the current ENBREL profit share.OtherBased on analysis of the results from the phase 3 trial for talimogene laherparepvec in melanoma, which met its primary endpoint, there were increases in management's estimates of probabilities of completing the BLA filing and receiving approval to market talimogene laherparepvec in specified patient populations in the United States and EU. Primarily due to these changes in key assumptions, the estimated aggregate fair value of the contingent consideration obligations increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 by $110 million and $111 million, respectively, and were recorded in Other operating expenses.Other operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, included certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives of $69 million and $70 million, respectively.Non-operating expenses/income and income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended Six months ended June 30, June 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012Interest expense, net$241 $256 $504 $491Interest and other income, net$96 $124 $260 $248Provision for income taxes$147 $191 $56 $373Effective tax rate10.5% 13.1% 2.0% 13.2%Interest expense, netThe decrease in interest expense, net for the three months ended June 30, 2013, was due primarily to the settlement of the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes in February 2013, offset partially by higher interest on other outstanding debt as a result of a higher average debt balance in the current year. Interest expense, net for the six months ended June 30, 2013, increased as interest resulting from the higher average debt balance on other outstanding debt exceeded the reduction in non-cash interest on our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes in the current year.Interest and other income, netThe decrease in interest and other income, net for the three months ended June 30, 2013, was due primarily to higher net gains on sales of investments recognized in the prior year. The increase in interest and other income, net for the six months ended June 30, 2013, was due primarily to higher interest income as a result of a higher average portfolio balance and higher portfolio investment returns during the current year, principally during the three months ended March 31, 2013, offset partially by higher net gains on sales of investments recognized in the prior year.Income taxesOur effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, were 10.5% and 2.0%, respectively, compared with 13.1% and 13.2% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2013, is due primarily to the current year reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit and changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses in 2013.27For the six months ended June 30, 2013, the effective tax rate was reduced by two significant events that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2013. First, the rate was reduced by the federal and state tax impacts of settlement of our examination with the IRS related to years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The settlement resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately $185 million. Second, the rate was reduced by the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2012 and 2013. The retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit for 2012 resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately $60 million.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, would have been 15.6% and 7.5%, respectively, compared with 18.5% and 18.6% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$22,018 $24,061Total assets52,610 54,298Current portion of long-term debt7 2,495Long-term debt23,908 24,034Stockholders’ equity20,594 19,060The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, Item 1A. Risk Factors—There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.) During the six months ended June 30, 2013, we repurchased 9.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $771 million at an average price of $85.03 per share. As of June 30, 2013, $1.6 billion remained available under our stock repurchase program, which is expected to cover our share repurchase activity into 2014. In December 2012 and March 2013, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.47 per share of common stock, which were paid on March 7 and June 7, 2013, respectively. On July 26, 2013, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per share of common stock, which will be paid on September 6, 2013. In February 2013, our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes matured/converted, and accordingly, the $2.5 billion principal amount was settled in cash. We also elected to pay the note holders who converted their notes $99 million of cash for the excess conversion value, as allowed under the original terms of the notes, which was offset by our receipt of the same amount of cash from the counterparty to the related convertible note hedge. In addition, in May 2013, warrants to acquire 32 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $104.80 originally sold in connection with the issuance of the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes were exercised resulting in a net cash payment of $100 million. See Note 7, Financing arrangements, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these transactions.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate, for the foreseeable future, to satisfy: our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we may strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to repurchase stock and pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported 28healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of June 30, 2013, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $434 million, of which $307 million was past due. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of June 30, 2013.Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Six months ended June 30, 2013 2012Net cash provided by operating activities$2,649 $3,347Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities3,768 (4,786)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities(3,868) 342OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2013, decreased due primarily to the receipt of $397 million of cash in the prior year period in connection with the termination of interest rate swap agreements and the timing of receipts from customers, including the impact of $197 million received under a government-funded program in Spain during the prior year period. InvestingCash provided by investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2013, was due primarily to net sales of marketable securities of $4.1 billion. Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2012, was due primarily to net purchases of marketable securities of $2.7 billion and acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired of $1.7 billion. Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Ireland and Puerto Rico, as well as other site developments, totaled $317 million and $316 million during the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We currently estimate 2013 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2013, was due primarily to the cash settlement of the $2.5 billion principal amount of the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes which matured/converted, repurchases of our common stock of $832 million and the payment of dividends of $707 million, offset partially by net proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $212 million.Cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2012, was due primarily to the issuance of long-term debt of $3.0 billion and the net proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $584 million, offset partially by repurchases of our common stock of $2.6 billion, the payment of dividends of $565 million, and the repayment of $102 million in long-term debt. See Note 7, Financing arrangements, and Note 8, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.29Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2013.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, and is incorporated herein by reference. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes during the six months ended June 30, 2013, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsTo achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2013, respectively, for an aggregate notional amount of $4.4 billion in contracts outstanding as of June 30, 2013. These derivative contracts qualify and have been designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges and effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating rate LIBOR-based coupon over the remaining lives of the hedged notes. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at June 30, 2013, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $320 million on our interest rate swap contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the ensuing year.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2013.Management determined that, as of June 30, 2013, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.30PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 11, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2013, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, the primary risks related to our business and periodically update those risks for material developments. These risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.There are no material updates from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.Item 6.
