Overview  The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2011, and June 30, 2011. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with GAAP.  Amgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as “Amgen,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is the world’s largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We focus solely on human therapeutics and concentrate on innovating novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We operate in one business segment — human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.  Currently, we market primarily recombinant protein therapeutics in supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products are: Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim); NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim); ENBREL (etanercept); and Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa) and EPOGEN® (epoetin alfa), erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Our international product sales consist principally of sales in Europe. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, our principal products represented 86% and 88% of worldwide product sales, respectively, and for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, our principal products represented 92% of worldwide product sales. Our other marketed products include principally Sensipar®/Mimpara® (cinacalcet), Vectibix® (panitumumab), Nplate® (romiplostim), Prolia® (denosumab) and XGEVA® (denosumab).    23    Table of Contents Significant developments  The following is a list of selected significant developments that occurred to date since the three-month period ended June 30, 2011, affecting our business. For additional 2011 developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2011, and June 30, 2011.  XGEVA®        •    On August 22, 2011, we announced that the FDA will target a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date of April 26, 2012, for the supplemental BLA to expand the indication for XGEVA® to treat men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer to reduce the risk of developing bone metastases.  Prolia®        •    On September 19, 2011, we announced that the FDA approved two new indications for Prolia® as a treatment to increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer and as a treatment to increase bone mass in men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer.  ESAs        •    On November 1, 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) finalized a rule to update various provisions of its bundled payment system for dialysis services and the related end stage renal disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program (QIP). Consistent with its earlier proposal, the final rule eliminated for payment year 2013 one of the QIP’s quality measures which tracks the percent of a provider’s Medicare patients with a hemoglobin level below 10 g/dL. CMS indicated that its removal of this quality measure from the QIP was being done in response to the June 2011 ESA label changes.           In aggregate, we still expect EPOGEN® dose utilization will decline in 2011 as compared with 2010 by 20% to 25% as a result of the bundled payment system, product label changes that occurred in 2011 and the above changes related to the QIP. We expect the impact of the dose utilization on sales to be offset partially by patient population growth and an increase in the average net sales price. We believe that the majority of these dose utilization changes will be implemented by the end of 2011 with some residual impact early in 2012.  Stock repurchase program        •    On October 13, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized an increase to our stock repurchase program to a total amount of $10 billion. We intend to accelerate our stock repurchase program, reflecting our confidence in the long-term value of the Company and the attractive interest rate environment.  Proposed legal settlement        •    On October 24, 2011, we announced that we have reached an agreement in principle to settle allegations relating to our sales and marketing practices arising out of the previously disclosed federal civil and criminal investigations pending in the U.S. Attorney’s Offices for the Eastern District of New York and the Western District of Washington. In connection with the agreement in principle, we recorded a $780 million charge (the legal settlement charge) during the three months ended September, 30, 2011, which, after taxes, reduced our net income and EPS during the third quarter by $705 million and $0.77 per share, respectively. See Note 12, Contingencies and commitments to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.    24    Table of Contents Selected financial information  The following provides an overview of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, as well as our financial condition as of September 30, 2011 (amounts in millions, except percentages and per-share data):          Change      Change      Change      Change      Change      Change        Three months endedSeptember 30,           Nine months endedSeptember 30,              2011     2010      Change      2011     2010      Change      Product sales:                                 U.S.   $ 2,965     $ 2,921       2 %     $ 8,718     $ 8,385       4 %     International     912       838       9 %       2,670       2,515       6 %                                                         Total product sales     3,877       3,759       3 %       11,388       10,900       4 %             Other revenues     67       57       18 %       221       312       (29)%                                                         Total revenues   $ 3,944     $ 3,816       3 %     $ 11,609     $ 11,212       4 %                                                                 Operating expenses   $ 3,419     $ 2,337       46 %     $ 8,459     $ 6,735       26 %             Operating income   $ 525     $ 1,479       (65)%     $ 3,150     $ 4,477       (30)%             Net income   $ 454     $ 1,236       (63)%     $ 2,749     $ 3,605       (24)%             Diluted EPS   $ 0.50     $ 1.28       (61)%     $ 2.96     $ 3.71       (20)%             Diluted shares     914       962       (5)%       930       971       (4)%    U.S. product sales increased 2% and 4% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively. During these periods, U.S. sales were negatively impacted by declines in sales of our ESA products, in particular EPOGEN®, of 20% and 16%, respectively. Excluding sales of our ESA products, U.S. sales increased 12% and 14% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively.  Excluding the $35 million and $61 million favorable impacts of foreign exchange, international product sales increased 5% and 4% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively. During these periods, international sales were negatively impacted by declines in sales of Aranesp® of 4% and 3%, respectively. Excluding Aranesp® sales and the impact of foreign exchange, international sales grew 12% and 10% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively.  The decrease in other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was due principally to certain milestone payments earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2010.  The increases in operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, were driven primarily by the legal settlement charge and higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs.  The decreases in net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, were due primarily to lower operating income; offset partially by lower effective income tax rates, due primarily to higher foreign tax credits in 2011 associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax discussed below.  The decreases in diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, were due to reductions in net income, offset partially by favorable impacts of our stock repurchase program, which reduced the number of shares used in the computations of diluted EPS.  Our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, were impacted by the Puerto Rico excise tax. Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the acquisition of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. This tax is currently scheduled to expire in 2016. We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is accrued. This excise tax has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our cost of sales and a significant favorable impact on our provision for income taxes. In addition, the overall impact of the excise tax will vary from period to period as a result of the timing difference between recognizing the expense and the applicable foreign tax credit. As a result of the excise tax, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, cost of sales increased by $74 million and $132 million, the provisions for income taxes were reduced by $106 million and $259 million, and EPS was favorably impacted by $0.04 and $0.14 per share, respectively.    25    Table of Contents As of September 30, 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $17.7 billion and total debt outstanding was $14.3 billion. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of September 30, 2011, approximately $16.8 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates.    26    Table of Contents Results of operations  Product sales  Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):         Change    Change    Change    Change    Change    Change       Three months endedSeptember 30,           Nine months endedSeptember 30,              2011     2010      Change      2011     2010      Change      Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN ®   $ 1,335     $ 1,254       6 %     $ 3,893     $ 3,607       8 %     ENBREL     925       914       1 %       2,756       2,595       6 %     Aranesp®      600       623       (4)%       1,765       1,853       (5)%     EPOGEN®     476       653       (27)%       1,554       1,933       (20)%     Sensipar®/Mimpara ®     206       175       18 %       592       526       13 %     Vectibix®      79       70       13 %       235       209       12 %     Nplate®      77       60       28 %       217       164       32 %     Prolia®      51       10       —        122       13       —      XGEVA®      102       —       —        217       —       —      Other     26       —       —        37       —       —                                                          Total product sales   $ 3,877     $ 3,759       3 %     $ 11,388     $ 10,900       4 %                                                                 Total U.S.   $ 2,965     $ 2,921       2 %     $ 8,718     $ 8,385       4 %     Total International     912       838       9 %       2,670       2,515       6 %                                                         Total product sales   $ 3,877     $ 3,759       3 %     $ 11,388     $ 10,900       4 %                                                        Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others.

The increase in combined U.S. sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was driven primarily by increases in the average net sales price and unit demand.  Excluding the $14 million favorable impact of foreign exchange during the three months ended September 30, 2011, combined Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® international sales decreased 2%, reflecting a decrease in the average net sales price, offset partially by an increase in unit demand, reflecting growth in Neulasta® due in part to continued conversion from NEUPOGEN®. Excluding the $25 million favorable impact of foreign exchange during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, combined Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® international sales decreased 1%, driven by a decline in NEUPOGEN® sales due in part to biosimilar    27    Table of Contents  competition, offset partially by an increase in Neulasta® sales due in part to continued conversion from NEUPOGEN®.  Future Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and increased first cycle penetration.

The increase in ENBREL sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price. ENBREL remains the leader in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments.  Future ENBREL sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.

This decrease in unit demand reflects an overall decline in the segment resulting from product label changes that occurred in June 2011. The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was due principally to a high-teens percentage point decrease in unit demand, offset partially by a mid single-digit percentage point increase in the average net sales price and a mid single-digit percentage point favorable change in accounting estimates for sales discounts. This decrease in unit demand reflects an overall decline in the segment.  Excluding the $10 million favorable impact of foreign exchange during the three months ended September 30, 2011, international Aranesp® sales decreased 6% due principally to an overall decline in the segment, while share remained stable. Excluding the $16 million favorable impact of foreign exchange during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, international Aranesp® sales decreased 5% due principally to a decrease in the average net sales price, reflecting an overall decline in the segment.  Future Aranesp® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2011, and June 30, 2011; and CMS’s recent changes related to the QIP.    28    Table of Contents EPOGEN®  Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):         Change    Change    Change    Change    Change    Change       Three months endedSeptember 30,           Nine months endedSeptember 30,              2011     2010      Change      2011     2010      Change      EPOGEN® — U.S.   $ 476     $ 653       (27)%     $ 1,554     $ 1,933       (20)%                                                        The decreases in EPOGEN® sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, were due primarily to declines in unit demand. During the three months ended September 30, 2011, a mid single-digit percentage point increase in the average net sales price was offset substantially by unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventories. The declines in unit demand reflect decreases in dose utilization due to implementation of the bundled payment system, product label changes that occurred in June 2011 and reimbursement changes proposed by CMS, offset slightly by patient population growth.  Future EPOGEN® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2011, and June 30, 2011; and CMS’s recent changes related to the QIP.

Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 13.7% of product sales compared with 15.6% for the corresponding period of the prior year. This decrease was driven primarily by lower bulk material cost and higher inventory write-offs during the three months ended September 30, 2010.  Cost of sales increased to 15.6% of product sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 14.4% of product sales compared with 15.1% for the corresponding period of the prior year. This decrease was driven primarily by lower bulk material cost and higher inventory write-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2010, offset partially by certain expenses related to actions to improve cost efficiencies.  Research and development  The increase in R&D expense for the three months ended September 30, 2011, was driven primarily by (i) increased costs associated with supporting later stage clinical programs, including AMG 386, ganitumab (AMG 479), talimogene laherparepvec and AMG 145, of $54 million; offset partially by (ii) decreased support for our marketed products of $8 million; and (iii) decreases in discovery research and translational sciences activities of $4 million.  The increase in R&D expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was driven primarily by (i) increased costs associated with supporting later stage clinical programs, including AMG 386, ganitumab (AMG 479), talimogene laherparepvec and AMG 145, of $205 million; (ii) increased support for our marketed products of $55 million, including support for Prolia®, among other programs, and our international expansion efforts; and (iii) increases in discovery research and translational sciences activities of $16 million due in part to process development efforts in support of our early pipeline.  Selling, general and administrative  The increase in SG&A expense for the three months ended September 30, 2011, was driven primarily by the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee of $29 million; higher ENBREL profit share expense of $26 million, under our collaboration agreement with Pfizer; increased expenses related to the launch of XGEVA® and expansion of our international operations of $28 million; and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $31 million.  The increase in SG&A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was driven primarily by the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee of $113 million; higher ENBREL profit share expense of $96 million; increased expenses related to the launches of Prolia® and XGEVA® and expansion of our international operations of $100 million; and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $64 million.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share were $328 million and $961 million, and $302 million and $865 million, respectively.    30    Table of Contents Under our collaboration agreement, we currently pay Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada attributable to all approved indications for ENBREL on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, we maintain a majority share of ENBREL profits. After expiration of the agreement in the fourth quarter of 2013, we will be required to pay Pfizer a declining percentage of annual net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada for three years, ranging from 12% to 10%. The amounts of such payments are anticipated to be significantly less than what would be owed based on the terms of the current ENBREL profit share.  Other  The increases in other operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, were driven primarily by the legal settlement charge of $780 million.  Non-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes  Non-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                            Three months endedSeptember 30,     Nine months endedSeptember 30,         2011       2010       2011       2010      Interest expense, net   $ 158     $ 150     $ 415     $ 442     Interest and other income, net   $ 87     $ 105     $ 364     $ 283     Provisions for income taxes   $ —     $ 198     $ 350     $ 713     Effective tax rate     0.0 %      13.8 %      11.3 %      16.5 %   Interest and other income, net  The increase in interest and other income, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was due primarily to higher net realized gains on investments of $71 million.  Income taxes  Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, were 0.0% and 11.3%, respectively, compared with 13.8% and 16.5%, respectively, for the corresponding periods of the prior year. The decreases in our effective tax rates were due primarily to foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. In addition, our tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2011, was impacted by changes to our income before income taxes due to the legal settlement charge. Excluding the impact of these items, our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, would have been 13.9% and 17.1%, respectively. In comparison to the respective prior year periods, these rates were higher due to the effect of the non-deductible U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee beginning in 2011 and the favorable resolution of certain prior years’ non-routine transfer pricing matters with tax authorities during the three months ended September 30, 2010, offset partially by the federal R&D credit that was not in effect in the prior year and changes in revenue and expense mix.  See Note 3, Income taxes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.    31    Table of Contents Financial condition, liquidity and capital resources  Selected financial data was as follows (in millions):                    September 30,     December 31,        2011     2010     Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities   $ 17,676     $ 17,422     Total assets     45,765       43,486     Commercial paper borrowings     300       —     Current portion of long-term debt     84       2,488     Long-term debt     13,881       10,874     Stockholders’ equity     23,553       23,944    The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends. On April 20, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5 billion of our common stock, and on October 13, 2011, the Board of Directors increased the total authorization for repurchase of our common stock by $6.1 billion to $10 billion. On April 20, 2011, the Board of Directors also approved a dividend policy related to our common stock and subsequently, on July 28, 2011, declared a cash dividend of $0.28 per share of common stock, which was paid on September 8, 2011, and on October, 13, 2011, declared a cash dividend of $0.28 per share of common stock, which will be paid on December 8, 2011. Both our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock reflect our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. Repurchases under our stock repurchase program also reflect our confidence in the long-term value of the Company. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers, as well as market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of additional factors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock in Part II of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011, and September 30, 2011.  We believe existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in each case for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States (U.S. funds); cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and in Part II of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2011, and September 30, 2011.  Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of September 30, 2011. None of our financing arrangements contain any financial covenants.    32    Table of Contents Cash flows  Our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions):                    Nine months ended September 30,        2011     2010     Net cash provided by operating activities   $ 3,535     $ 3,779     Net cash used in investing activities     (566 )      (3,661 )    Net cash used in financing activities     (2,365 )      (51 )   Operating  Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, decreased due primarily to the impact of increased inventory related expenditures and the timing and amount of payments to vendors, offset partially by the timing and amounts of payments to tax authorities. The reduction in net income during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was driven primarily by the accrual of the legal settlement charge of $780 million, which will be paid in a subsequent period.  Investing  Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was due primarily to cash used for acquiring businesses totaling $701 million and capital expenditures of $343 million, offset partially by net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $467 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, cash used in investing activities was due primarily to net purchases of marketable securities of $3.2 billion and capital expenditures of $398 million. Capital expenditures during both the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, were associated primarily with manufacturing-capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and other site developments. We currently estimate 2011 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $600 million.  Financing  Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $3.0 billion; repayment of $2.5 billion of long-term debt; and payment of dividends of $255 million, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and commercial paper of $3.3 billion. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2010, was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $2.6 billion, offset substantially by the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $2.5 billion.  See Note 8, Financing arrangements and Note 9, Stockholders’ equity to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.    33    Table of Contents Critical accounting policies  The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and supplemented in Part I, Item 2, of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2011. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies in the three months ended September 30, 2011.    34    Table of Contents   Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Information about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and is incorporated herein by reference. There have been no material changes for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.      Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2011.  Management determined that, as of September 30, 2011, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    35    Table of Contents PART II — OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  See Note 12, Contingencies and commitments to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011, and March 31, 2011, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. These discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 19, Contingencies and commitments to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.      Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described the primary risks relating to our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and periodically update those risks for material developments. These risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, operations, liquidity and stock price materially and adversely.  Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and in Part II, Item IA, of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2011, and June 30, 2011, provide additional disclosure and context for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.  Global Economic Environment  The information below regarding the global economic environment updates the following risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011: — Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers; and — Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business.  Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by economic conditions. Sales of our principal products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and private payer healthcare and insurance programs. In the United States, there is an increased focus from the federal government and others on analyzing the impact of various regulatory programs on the federal deficit, which could result in increased pressure on federal programs to reduce costs. The Budget Control Act, signed into law in the United States in August 2011, mandated the creation of the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction (Joint Committee) which was charged with identifying at least $1.2 trillion in savings over ten years. The Joint Committee is required to develop and agree on specific deficit-reducing actions by November 23, 2011, and Congress must then vote on such actions by December 23, 2011. If Congress fails to reduce the U.S. deficit by at least $1.2 trillion by this deadline, a government-wide two percent sequestration will occur, which would include cuts to Medicare of up to two percent of program spending per fiscal year. Several deficit reduction proposals have been put forth by President Obama or Congressional committees, including proposals designed to further limit federal healthcare expenditures. While we cannot predict whether any deficit reduction actions will be agreed to by the Joint Committee and approved by Congress and/or whether a government budget sequestration will occur, a reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from U.S. government programs as a result of changes such as those that have been proposed could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations.  Economic conditions continue to affect our operations and performance outside the United States as well, particularly in countries where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare expenditures, including drugs and biologics. In Europe, economic conditions across the region could potentially be impacted by countries of key concern like Greece, which is facing possible default of its sovereign debt obligations, and Spain and Italy, whose sovereign debt obligations were recently downgraded. While mandatory price reductions have been a recurring aspect of business for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries outside of the United States, given the current worldwide economic conditions, certain countries have increased the frequency and/or size of such mandatory price reductions to extract further cost savings. Austerity plans in a number of countries, including Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, have targeted the pharmaceutical sector with multiple mechanisms to reduce government expenditures. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also impact the extent to which countries are willing to reward new innovative    36    Table of Contents  therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. While we cannot fully predict the extent of further price reductions and/or reimbursement restrictions taken by governmental payers outside of the United States or the impact such actions will have on our business, such reductions in price and/or the coverage and reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operation.  Additionally, we rely upon third-parties for certain parts of our business, including licensees and partners, wholesale distributors of our products, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and single third-party suppliers. Because of the recent volatility in the financial markets, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third-parties which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. Current economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Further, economic conditions appear to have affected, and may continue to affect, the business practices of our wholesale distributors in a manner that has and may continue to contribute to lower sales of our products. For example, in the first quarter of 2009, certain of our wholesale distributors lowered their levels of inventory on hand, which we believe was done to reduce their carrying costs and improve their results of operations. Although we monitor our distributors’, customers’ and suppliers’ financial condition and their liquidity in order to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. These risks may be elevated with respect to our interactions with third parties with substantial operations in countries where current economic conditions are the most severe, particularly where such third parties are themselves exposed to sovereign risk from business interactions directly with fiscally-challenged government payers.  Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.  We have reached an agreement in principle to settle the allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices arising out of the ongoing civil and criminal investigations conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Offices for the Eastern District of New York and the Western District of Washington. (See Note 12, Contingencies and commitments in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.) The proposed settlement involves numerous state and federal agencies and remains subject to continuing discussions regarding the components of the agreement, and the completion and execution of all required documentation. Until the proposed settlement becomes final, there can be no guarantee that these matters will be resolved by the agreement in principle. If the proposed settlement is not finalized as proposed, we would have to continue to explain and defend our actions to government entities involved, which would be burdensome, expensive and time-consuming for us and could result in criminal charges, civil penalties or other enforcement actions. In addition, while the agreement in principle includes the dismissal of the claims of the government in the Ten Qui Tam Actions (as defined in Note 12, Contingencies and commitments in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements), the individual Relators in the Ten Qui Tam Actions have the opportunity to join in the proposed settlement or, if they object, to have the settlement evaluated in a federal court fairness hearing to determine whether it is fair, adequate and reasonable under all the circumstances. If the court determines that the settlement is not fair, adequate and reasonable, then we would have the option to continue to defend our actions in court, or to seek to negotiate a new settlement. We have been made aware that we are a defendant in several other civil qui tam actions that remain under seal in the U.S. federal courts where they were filed. Included with these actions are allegations that our promotional, contracting, sales and marketing activities relating to ENBREL and Aranesp® caused the submission of various false claims under the Federal Civil False Claims Act and various State False Claims Acts. Certain of the allegations in these other actions are not encompassed in the proposed settlement discussed above. In addition, as described in Note 12, Contingencies and commitments in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements, this proposed settlement does not cover a number of other litigation matters that will continue to be pending against us.  If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.  Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Third parties may challenge,    37    Table of Contents  invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, involved in patent litigation. A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed, or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the product that is alleged to infringe to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. For example, until the Pennsylvania District Court entered final judgment and a permanent injunction against Teva on July 15, 2011 pursuant to a joint stipulation and settlement agreement between the parties (see Note 12, Contingencies and commitments to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2011), Teva had announced that it intended to sell its filgrastim product, upon approval from the FDA, in the United States without a license from us and prior to the expiration of our granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) patents. The period of time from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to fully recover for the losses, damages, and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.  Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, products approved by the FDA under a new drug application may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitors before the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act has expired and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product.  Over the next several years, many of the existing patents on our principal products will begin to expire. As our patents expire, competitors may be able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which may result in a reduction in the use and sales of our products. We have received, and we continue to seek, additional patent protection relating to our products, including patents on our products, specific processes for making our products, formulations and particular uses of our products. While our patent estate on some products may broaden as patents that have been pending in the patent office are ultimately issued, competitors may be able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products. For example, while we do not expect biosimilars competition on ENBREL in the United States for the foreseeable future, there are a number of competing therapies currently on the market and more in clinical development that are different from ENBREL but are used to treat the same inflammatory diseases treated by ENBREL. Although we continue to develop new products, and obtain patent protection for these new product candidates, we may not be able to replace the revenue lost upon the expiration of the patents on our current products.  From time to time, U.S. and other policymakers have proposed reforming the patent laws and regulations of their countries. In September 2011, after years of Congressional debate regarding patent reform legislation, President Obama signed into law the America Invents Act (the Act) considered by many to be the most substantial revision of U.S. patent law since 1952. The Act’s various provisions will go into effect over an 18-month period. The Act changes the current “first-to-invent” system to a system that awards a patent to the “first-inventor-to-file” for an application for a patentable invention. This change alters the pool of available materials that can be used to challenge patents and eliminates the ability to rely on prior research work in order to lay claim to patent rights. Disputes as to whether the first filer is in fact the true inventor will be resolved through newly implemented derivation proceedings. The Act also creates mechanisms to allow challenges to newly issued patents in the patent office in post-grant proceedings and new inter partes reexamination proceedings. Although many of the changes bring U.S. law into closer harmony with European and other national patent laws, the new bases and procedures may make it easier for competitors to challenge our patents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The changes may also make it harder to challenge third-party patents and place greater importance on being the first inventor to file a patent application on an invention.  We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.  We rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In addition, some of our clinical trials involve drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in a clinical trial in combination with one of our product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products’ relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies has unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of their work or creates a shortage of supply, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. As a result, this could adversely affect our ability to file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide on a timely basis, if at all.    38    Table of Contents The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.  We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in applicable tax laws regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof. For example, there are several proposals under consideration in the U.S. to reform tax law, including proposals that may reduce or eliminate the deferral of U.S. income tax on our unrepatriated foreign earnings. While it is uncertain how the U.S. Congress may address U.S. tax policy matters in the future, reform of U.S. taxation, including taxation of international income, continues to be a topic of discussion for the U.S. Congress and the Administration. A significant change to the U.S. tax system, such as a change to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.  Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.  On September 30, 2011, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes group (KDIGO) released its draft global anemia clinical practice guidelines for public review and comment. KDIGO has indicated that final guidelines could be available by early 2012.  ESA developments  On November 1, 2011, CMS finalized a rule to update various provisions of its bundled payment system for dialysis services and the related ESRD QIP (see Part I. Item 2. MD&A – Significant developments – ESAs).  Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities  The West German Study Group will be presenting data from the ARA Plus Study, one of the studies included in our pharmacovigilance program for Aranesp®, at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2011.  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.  In addition to the clinical trials that we choose to or are required to conduct to evaluate our products or product candidates, other organizations may also conduct clinical trials that use our products. The results of those clinical trials can affect our ability to maintain or gain regulatory approval whether or not those trials are conducted by us. For example, we have learned that the investigator-sponsored REAL-3 trial, a phase 3 study examining panitumumab for the treatment of advanced esophagogastric cancer, was recently closed for recruitment by the study sponsor, the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. The sponsor has informed us that recruitment was closed because an independent data monitoring committee found a statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two arms of the trial, with inferior outcomes demonstrated in patients treated in the experimental arm (reduced dose of Epirubicin, Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine (EOX) chemotherapy regimens plus panitumumab compared to standard dose EOX alone). At this time, we have received limited data from the study sponsor. While panitumumab is not approved for the treatment of advanced esophagogastric cancer and we are not pursuing approval in this indication through Amgen-sponsored studies, regulatory authorities may request to review this new trial data. Such authorities could determine that this data is relevant to the use of panitumumab in indications other than advanced esophagogastric cancer and take regulatory actions that affect our approved indications, including requiring the addition of relevant safety data to the approved labeling for panitumumab.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.  On October 13, 2011, our Board of Directors increased the total authorization for repurchases of our common stock by $6.1 billion to $10 billion.    39    Table of Contents   Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers, as well as market transactions.  Our repurchase activity for the three months ended September 30, 2011, was as follows:         announced program     announced program     announced program     announced program                    Total number of     Maximum $ value        Total number     Average     shares purchased     that may yet be        of shares     price paid     as part of publicly     purchased under the        purchased     per share     announced program     program(1)     July 1 - July 31     —     $ —       —     $ 6,431,749,468     August 1 - August 31     28,463,800       52.20       28,463,800       4,945,936,828     September 1 - September 30     16,939,600       55.21       16,939,600       4,010,746,811                                         45,403,400       53.32       45,403,400                                                 (1)   Following the repurchase of $147 million in additional shares in early October 2011, on October 13, 2011, our Board of Directors increased the authorization for repurchase of our common stock by $6.1 billion to an aggregate of $10 billion.
