For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.Products/PipelineBone healthRomosozumab•In February 2016, we and UCB, our collaboration partner in the development of romosozumab, announced that the phase 3 FRAME study (FRActure study in postmenopausal woMen with ostEoporosis) met its co-primary endpoints. •In March 2016, we and UCB announced that the phase 3 BRIDGE study (placeBo-contRolled study evaluatIng the efficacy anD safety of romosozumab in treatinG mEn with osteoporosis) met its primary endpoint.InflammationEnbrel® (etanercept)•In March 2016, we announced that the FDA accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the expanded use of Enbrel® to treat pediatric patients with chronic severe plaque psoriasis. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date of November 5, 2016, as a goal for the completion of its review of our application.Oncology/HematologyBLINCYTO®(blinatumomab)•In March 2016, we announced that we submitted an sBLA to the FDA for BLINCYTO® to include new data supporting the treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Nplate®(romiplostim)•In April 2016, we announced that the phase 3 study of Nplate® in children with symptomatic immune thromobocytopenia met its primary endpoint.Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (dollar and share amounts in millions, except per share data):  Three months ended    March 31,    2016 2015 ChangeProduct sales:      U.S. $4,119 $3,771 9 %Rest of the world (ROW) 1,120 1,103 2 %Total product sales 5,239 4,874 7 %Other revenues 288 159 81 %Total revenues $5,527 $5,033 10 %Operating expenses $3,125 $3,011 4 %Operating income $2,402 $2,022 19 %Net income $1,900 $1,623 17 %Diluted EPS $2.50 $2.11 18 %Diluted shares 760 770 (1)%Global product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016, increased led by ENBREL, Prolia®, Aranesp®, Neulasta®, Kyprolis®, XGEVA® and Sensipar®/Mimpara®.26The increase in other revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was driven primarily by an upfront partner payment received for a license transaction and higher Ibrance® royalty income.The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was driven primarily by increased support for launch products. All categories of operating expenses benefited from savings from our transformation and process improvement efforts.The increases in net income and diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2016, were driven by increases in revenues and operating income.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates were not material for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2016 2015 ChangeENBREL $1,385 $1,116 24 %Neulasta® 1,183 1,134 4 %Aranesp® 532 480 11 %XGEVA®  378 340 11 %Sensipar®/Mimpara® 367 334 10 %Prolia®  352 272 29 %EPOGEN® 300 534 (44)%NEUPOGEN® 213 246 (13)%Other products 529 418 27 %Total product sales $5,239 $4,874 7 %Future sales of our products are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others. Such factors are discussed below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, in the following sections: (i) Overview, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products, (ii) Item 1A. Risk Factors and (iii) Item 7. Results of Operations—Product Sales.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2016 2015 Change ENBREL — U.S. $1,326 $1,052 26 %ENBREL — Canada 59 64 (8)%Total ENBREL $1,385 $1,116 24 %The increase in ENBREL sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price as well as favorable changes in end-user inventories, based on prescription data, and wholesaler inventories, offset partially by a decline in units due to competition.27Neulasta® Total Neulasta® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2016 2015 Change Neulasta®— U.S. $996 $922 8 %Neulasta®— ROW 187 212 (12)%Total Neulasta® $1,183 $1,134 4 %The increase in global Neulasta® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was driven primarily by both higher unit demand and net selling price in the United States. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Neulasta® Onpro™ kit represented approximately one-third of our U.S. Neulasta® business.Our final material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) expired in October 2015. On December 17, 2014, and November 18, 2015, Apotex and Sandoz, respectively, announced that the FDA had accepted their respective applications for filing under the abbreviated pathway for their pegfilgrastim products that are proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta®. Therefore, we expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on Neulasta® sales. For discussion of ongoing litigation between us and Apotex and Sandoz, see Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Future Neulasta® sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2016 2015 Change Aranesp® — U.S. $261 $189 38 %Aranesp® — ROW 271 291 (7)%Total Aranesp® $532 $480 11 %The increase in global Aranesp® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was driven by higher unit demand, including the shift by some U.S. dialysis customers from EPOGEN® to Aranesp®, offset partially by unfavorable changes in net selling price. Supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries relating to our European patent for darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp®) will expire in June 2016. For further information related to our patents, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part 1, Item 1. Business.XGEVA®  Total XGEVA® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2016 2015 ChangeXGEVA® — U.S. $271 $245 11 %XGEVA® — ROW 107 95 13%Total XGEVA® $378 $340 11%The increase in global XGEVA® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was driven primarily by higher unit demand.28Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2016 2015 ChangeSensipar® — U.S. $278 $241 15 %Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW 89 93 (4)%Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® $367 $334 10 %The increase in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price and higher unit demand, offset partially by unfavorable changes in wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories.Prolia® Total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2016 2015 ChangeProlia® — U.S. $221 $170 30 %Prolia® — ROW 131 102 28%Total Prolia® $352 $272 29%The increase in global Prolia® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was driven primarily by higher unit demand.EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2016 2015 ChangeEPOGEN® — U.S. $300 $534 (44)%The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was driven primarily by a decline in units resulting from competition and, to a lesser extent, a shift by some U.S. dialysis customers to Aranesp®.Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN® expired in May 2015. There is competition in the United States, which will intensify and continue to have a material adverse impact on EPOGEN® sales. Currently, in the United States, EPOGEN® and Aranesp® compete with MIRCERA®, which Roche began selling in October 2014 and, as of May 2015, for which it licensed commercialization rights in the United States to Galenica Group. MIRCERA® competes with Aranesp® in the nephrology segment only. On December 16, 2014, Hospira submitted a BLA to the FDA for Retacrit™, a proposed biosimilar to EPOGEN®, under the abbreviated pathway. For discussion of ongoing litigation between us and Hospira, see Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.NEUPOGEN® NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2016 2015 ChangeNEUPOGEN® — U.S. $150 $181 (17)%NEUPOGEN® — ROW 63 65 (3)%Total NEUPOGEN® $213 $246 (13)%29The decrease in global NEUPOGEN® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was driven primarily by lower unit demand in the United States due to the impact of short-acting competition.There is competition in the United States, which will intensify and continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of NEUPOGEN®. On September 3, 2015, Sandoz announced it had launched Zarxio™, a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN®, in the United States. On February 17, 2015, Apotex announced that the FDA had accepted its application for filing, under the abbreviated pathway for its biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN®. For discussion of ongoing, related litigation, see Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2016 2015 ChangeKyprolis® — U.S. $129 $97 33 %Kyprolis® — ROW 25 11 *Vectibix® — U.S. 56 47 19 %Vectibix® — ROW 88 75 17 %Nplate® — U.S. 86 78 10 %Nplate® — ROW 55 48 15 %BLINCYTO® — U.S. 21 15 40 %BLINCYTO® — ROW 6 — N/ARepatha® — U.S. 14 — N/ARepatha® — ROW 2 — N/AOther — U.S. 10 — N/AOther — ROW 37 47 (21)%Total other products $529 $418 27 %Total U.S. — other products $316 $237 33 %Total ROW — other products 213 181 18 %Total other products $529 $418 27 %* Change in excess of 100%Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2016 2015 Change Cost of sales $1,018 $1,033 (1)%% of product sales 19.4% 21.2%  % of total revenues 18.4% 20.5%  Research and development $872 $894 (2)%% of product sales 16.6% 18.3%  % of total revenues 15.8% 17.8%  Selling, general and administrative $1,203 $1,026 17 %% of product sales 23.0% 21.1%  % of total revenues 21.8% 20.4%  Other $32 $58 (45)%* Change in excess of 100%30Transformation and process improvementsWe continue to execute on the transformation and process improvement efforts announced in 2014. As part of these efforts, we committed to a more focused operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities to deliver value to patients and stockholders. The transformation and process improvement efforts include a restructuring, which is delivering cost savings and funding investments.We continue to estimate that the restructuring will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $800 million to $900 million, of which $668 million was incurred through March 31, 2016. The charges recorded related to the restructuring during the three months ended March 31, 2016, were not significant. We expect that we will incur most of the remaining estimated costs in 2016 and 2017 in order to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts.In 2016, an estimated $400 million in benefits from our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts, versus 2015, will enable continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities.Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 18.4% of total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease was driven primarily by manufacturing efficiencies, higher net selling prices and lower royalties.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 16.8% and 18.7% of total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. See Note 4, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe decrease in R&D expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was driven by decreased costs associated with our later stage clinical programs support of $264 million, offset by increased costs in marketed products support of $242 million. Discovery Research and Translational Sciences spend was unchanged. Prior to approval, costs related to our launch products were categorized largely as later stage clinical programs. All categories of R&D benefited from savings that resulted from transformation and process improvement efforts, a portion of which were reinvested for the long-term benefit of the Company.Selling, general and administrativeThe increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was driven primarily by new product launches and a $73 million charge related to an acquisition, offset partially by savings that resulted from transformation and process improvement efforts. OtherOther operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016, included a legal proceeding charge of $27 million.Other operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2015, included certain charges related to our restructuring, primarily severance of $57 million.Non-operating expenses/income and income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended  March 31,  2016 2015Interest expense, net $294 $252Interest and other income, net $150 $106Provision for income taxes $358 $253Effective tax rate 15.9% 13.5%Interest expense, netThe increase in Interest expense, net for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was due primarily to a higher average amount of fixed-rate debt outstanding.31Interest and other income, netThe increase in Interest and other income, net for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was due primarily to higher average cash balances and a slightly higher yield on the portfolio.Income taxesThe increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses, and a benefit from a state tax audit settlement during the three months ended March 31, 2015. This increase was offset partially by the adoption of a new accounting standard that amends certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based compensation payments. One aspect of the standard requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as an income tax benefit and expense in the income statement.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2016, would have been 18.8%, compared with 17.1% for the corresponding period of the prior year.See Note 4, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$34,740 $31,382Total assets$75,116 $71,449Current portion of long-term debt$2,247 $2,247Long-term debt$32,060 $29,182Stockholders’ equity$28,682 $28,083We intend to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, in which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. In March 2016, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock, which will be paid on June 8, 2016. In December 2015, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock, which was paid on March 8, 2016.We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased $690 million of our stock and paid $676 million in cash during the period. During the first quarter of 2015, we repurchased $451 million of our stock and paid $464 million in cash during the period. As of March 31, 2016, $4.2 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as “U.S. funds”) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.32Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaling $34.7 billion as of March 31, 2016, approximately $27.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan each include a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of March 31, 2016.Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Three months ended March 31, 2016 2015Net cash provided by operating activities$1,915 $1,482Net cash used in investing activities$(4,390) $(952)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$1,227 $(1,397)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016, benefited from an improvement in our operating margin and the timing of rebates paid to customers and payments to vendors and corporate partners.InvestingCash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $4.2 billion and capital expenditures of $156 million. Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2015, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $731 million and capital expenditures of $118 million. Capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in various locations, as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2016 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.FinancingCash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016, was due primarily to proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments of $2.8 billion, offset partially by the payment of dividends of $752 million and repurchases of our common stock of $676 million. Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2015, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $599 million, to repurchases of common stock of $464 million and to a $225 million settlement of an obligation incurred in connection with the acquisition of Onyx.See Note 9, Financing arrangements, and Note 10, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2016.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and is incorporated herein by reference. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes during the three months ended March 31, 2016, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.33Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsDuring the three months ended March 31, 2016, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the entire principal amount of the debt denominated in euros and Swiss francs that we issued during this period. As of March 31, 2016, we had open cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt securities to U.S. dollars and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of March 31, 2016, would result in a reduction in the aggregate fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $600 million, but would have no material effect on cash flows or income.Foreign currency sensitive financial instrumentsAs of March 31, 2016, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a carrying value of $6.0 billion and a fair value of $6.5 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to exchange rates as of March 31, 2016, would result in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $1.3 billion and a reduction in income of approximately $1.2 billion, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows. The analysis for this debt does not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the related cross-currency swap contracts which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt.With regard to our $5.6 billion notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros, pound sterling and Swiss francs, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to exchange rates as of March 31, 2016, would result in a reduction in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $1.2 billion, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows. The impact on income during this period from the above mentioned hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2016.Management determined that, as of March 31, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016, and Note 12, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2015, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.34Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, provide additional disclosure for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability.Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue aggressive initiatives to contain costs and manage drug utilization and are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom our products will be reimbursed by payers. Public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs is increasing and more control over pricing could hurt our ability to price our products based upon their value.A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from the U.S. federal government healthcare programs and private insurance plans regulated by the U.S. federal government. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part 1, Item 1. Business—Reimbursement.) Changes to U.S. federal reimbursement policy may come through legislative actions such as The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or as a result of regulations implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare, Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces. CMS has substantial power to quickly implement policy changes that can significantly affect how our products are covered and reimbursed. State government actions can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed. Examples of proposals that have been discussed and debated but not yet enacted include state initiatives designed to require pharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information or to place a maximum price ceiling, or cap, on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies. Legislative or regulatory changes or other government initiatives that decrease the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates, limit our ability to offer commercial patient co-pay payment assistance or limit the pricing of pharmaceutical products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Payers, including healthcare insurers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and others, increasingly seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage. Consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers. Payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients, and some payers may attempt to limit the use of commercial patient co-pay payment assistance programs. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to our products, such as requiring prior authorizations or step therapy, and may even choose to exclude coverage entirely. For example, since the launch of Repatha® in August 2015, the application of utilization management criteria by some payers, including PBMs, has resulted in denials of coverage for a substantial number of patients for whom Repatha® has been prescribed, slowing Repatha® sales. Ultimately, discounts, rebates, plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products.We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products to U.S. government healthcare programs. Pricing data that we submit impacts the payment rates for providers, rebates we pay, and discounts we are required to provide under Medicare, Medicaid and other government drug programs. Government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. Our price reporting data calculations are reviewed on a monthly and quarterly basis, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions and/or underlying data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.35Outside the United States, we expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce their healthcare expenditures. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part 1, Item 1. Business—Reimbursement.) For example, international reference pricing (IRP) is widely used by a large number of countries to control costs based on an external benchmark of a product’s price in other countries. IRP policies can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. Any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our products or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant disruptions or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials.We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for NEUPOGEN®, Aranesp®, EPOGEN®, Prolia® and XGEVA® and substantially all of the formulation, fill and finish operations for Neulasta® and ENBREL at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. We also currently perform all of the bulk manufacturing for Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN® and Aranesp®, all of the purification of bulk EPOGEN® material and substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for Prolia® and XGEVA® at this facility. We perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill and finish, and packaging for product candidates to be used in clinical trials at our manufacturing facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) Since June 2015, when the Governor of Puerto Rico announced that the government (including certain government entities) is unable to pay its roughly $72 billion in debt, the government’s liquidity position has continued to deteriorate. In early April 2016, the Puerto Rico government enacted the Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Financial Rehabilitation Act (Act No. 21-2016) that authorizes the Governor to declare a fiscal emergency and implement a temporary debt moratorium until January 2017. Pursuant to the new law, the Governor issued an Executive Order that declared a fiscal emergency and implemented the debt moratorium in order to prevent a shutdown of essential government services and manage the government’s cash liquidity. As of May 2, 2016, it is being reported that the Puerto Rico government is not making certain payments. In the meantime, the government continues to negotiate with its various creditors. If the Puerto Rico government is not able to restructure the debt obligations or get forbearance on debt payments, it could impact the territorial government’s provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business, create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, and make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico.Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSDuring the three months ended March 31, 2016, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program and the repurchase activity was as follows: Total numberof sharespurchased Averageprice paidper share Total number ofshares purchasedas part of publicly announced program Maximum dollarvalue that mayyet be purchasedunder the program(1)January 1 - 311,096,244 $150.50 1,096,244 $4,751,327,332February 1 - 292,387,395 $146.10 2,387,395 $4,402,537,887March 1 - 311,211,995 $145.26 1,211,995 $4,226,482,930 4,695,634 $146.91 4,695,634  (1)In October 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an increase that resulted in a total of $5.0 billion available under the stock repurchase program.Item 6.
