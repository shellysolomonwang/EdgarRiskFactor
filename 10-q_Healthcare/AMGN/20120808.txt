Overview  The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2012. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with GAAP.  Amgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as “Amgen,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is the world’s largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We focus solely on human therapeutics and concentrate on innovative novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We operate in one business segment — human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.  Currently, we market primarily recombinant protein therapeutics in supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products are Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim), ENBREL (etanercept) and our erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs): Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa) and EPOGEN® (epoetin alfa). Our product sales outside of the United States consist principally of sales in Europe. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, our principal products represented 83% of worldwide product sales; and for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, our principal products represented 88% of worldwide product sales. Our other marketed products include principally Sensipar®/Mimpara® (cinacalcet), Vectibix® (panitumumab), Nplate® (romiplostim), XGEVA® (denosumab) and Prolia® (denosumab).    25    Table of Contents Significant developments  Following is a summary of selected significant developments affecting our business that have occurred to date since March 31, 2012. For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2012.  Chief Executive Officer Succession        •    On May 23, 2012, the Board of the Company appointed Mr. Robert A. Bradway, 49, to serve as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, replacing Mr. Kevin W. Sharer. Previously, Mr. Bradway served as the Company’s President and Chief Operating Officer since May 2010.  Products/Pipeline  AMG 145        •    On July 26, 2012, we announced that in four phase 2 studies (evaluating AMG 145 as monotherapy, in combination with statin therapy, in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and in statin-intolerant subjects), treatment with AMG 145 resulted in a statistically significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Based on the phase 2 efficacy and safety data, we plan to initiate phase 3 development in early 2013.  Ganitumab (AMG 479)        •    On August 8, 2012, we announced a decision to stop the ganitumab phase 3 GAMMA (Gemcitabine and AMG 479 in Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas) trial in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer following the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Based on the review of a pre-planned interim analysis, the DMC concluded that the addition of ganitumab to gemcitabine is unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of overall survival compared to gemcitabine alone. There were no safety concerns raised in the DMC review of the study.  XGEVA®        •    On June 15, 2012, we filed a Type II variation with the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of men with castration-resistant prostate cancer at high risk of developing bone metastases as determined by prostate specific antigen levels, based on data from the ‘147 study.  Sensipar®        •    On June 8, 2012, we announced top-line results of the phase 3 EValuation Of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events (E.V.O.L.V.E™) trial, which evaluated Sensipar®/Mimpara® (cinacalcet) for the reduction of the risk of mortality and cardiovascular events among 3,883 patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism and CKD receiving dialysis. The primary endpoint of the study was time to the composite event comprising all-cause mortality or first non-fatal cardiovascular event, including myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure or peripheral vascular event. Although patients in the Sensipar®/Mimpara® arm experienced numerically fewer composite primary events, the results were not statistically significant, and the trial did not meet its primary endpoint in the intent-to-treat analysis.  Acquisition        •    On June 12, 2012, we acquired 99.4% of the outstanding stock of Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals, a privately held company that is a leading supplier of pharmaceuticals to the hospital sector and a major supplier of injectable medicines in Turkey. The acquisition provides us with the opportunity to expand our presence in Turkey and the surrounding region.    26    Table of Contents Selected financial information  Following is an overview of our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, as well as our financial condition as of June 30, 2012 (amounts in millions, except percentages and per-share data):                                          Three months endedJune 30,           Six months endedJune 30,              2012     2011      Change      2012     2011      Change      Product sales:                                 U.S.   $ 3,255     $ 2,975       9 %     $ 6,252     $ 5,753       9 %     ROW     945       918       3 %       1,849       1,758       5 %                                                         Total product sales     4,200       3,893       8 %       8,101       7,511       8 %             Other revenues     277       66       —        424       154       —                                                          Total revenues   $ 4,477     $ 3,959       13 %     $ 8,525     $ 7,665       11 %                                                                 Operating expenses   $ 2,888     $ 2,627       10 %     $ 5,459     $ 5,040       8 %             Operating income   $ 1,589     $ 1,332       19 %     $ 3,066     $ 2,625       17 %             Net income   $ 1,266     $ 1,170       8 %     $ 2,450     $ 2,295       7 %             Diluted EPS   $ 1.61     $ 1.25       29 %     $ 3.09     $ 2.45       26 %             Diluted shares     785       935       (16)%       792       938       (16)%    The increases in U.S. product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, reflect growth for all of our marketed products except ESAs, which declined 6% and 12%, respectively. Excluding ESAs, U.S. product sales increased 15% and 16%, respectively.  The increases in rest-of-the-world (ROW) product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, reflect growth for all of our marketed products except Aranesp®, which declined 7% and 5%, and combined Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales, which declined 13% and 8%, respectively.  The increases in other revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, were due primarily to revenue recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2012, related to changes in our motesanib collaboration with Takeda. As part of efforts to focus R&D activities, we replaced the global co-development and profit share agreement for motesanib with an exclusive license for Takeda to develop, manufacture and commercialize motesanib. This resulted in revenue recognition of $206 million from upfront payments received from Takeda and deferred when the collaboration was originally formed in 2008. In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2012, we received milestone payments in connection with entering into a collaboration with AstraZeneca and with receipt of marketing approval of AMG 223 in Japan by Astellas Pharma Inc.  The increases in net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, were due primarily to higher operating income, offset partially by higher interest expense, net, due primarily to a higher average debt balance.  The increases in diluted EPS for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, were driven primarily by the favorable impacts of our stock repurchase program, which reduced the number of shares used to compute diluted EPS, and, to a lesser degree, by increases in net income.  Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the purchase of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is imposed on the gross intercompany purchase price of the goods and services and is effective for a six-year period beginning in 2011, with the excise tax rate declining in each year (4% in 2011, 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in 2013, 2.5% in 2014, 2.25% in 2015 and 1% in 2016). We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes when the excise tax is incurred. This excise tax has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our cost of sales and a significant favorable impact on our provision for income taxes. In addition, the overall impact of the excise tax will vary from period to period as a result of the timing difference between recognizing the expense and the applicable tax credit. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, cost of    27    Table of Contents  sales increased by $85 million and $166 million, respectively, compared with $45 million and $58 million for the corresponding periods of the prior year. The provision for income taxes decreased by $95 million and $182 million, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, as a result of this excise tax compared with $86 million and $153 million for the corresponding periods of the prior year.  As of June 30, 2012, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $22.5 billion and total debt outstanding was $24.4 billion. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of June 30, 2012, approximately $17.7 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates.  Results of operations  Product sales  Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                          Three months endedJune 30,           Six months endedJune 30,              2012     2011      Change      2012     2011      Change      Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN ®   $ 1,347     $ 1,326       2 %     $ 2,691     $ 2,558       5 %     ENBREL     1,058       956       11 %       1,996       1,831       9 %     Aranesp®      536       585       (8)%       1,054       1,165       (10)%     EPOGEN®      525       543       (3)%       971       1,078       (10)%     Other products     734       483       52 %       1,389       879       58 %                                                         Total product sales   $ 4,200     $ 3,893       8 %     $ 8,101     $ 7,511       8 %                                                        Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others do.

The decreases in combined ROW Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, were due primarily to decreases in NEUPOGEN® unit demand from loss of share to biosimilars and to decreases in the average net sales price of Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®.  Future Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.    28    Table of Contents ENBREL  Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                          Three months endedJune 30,           Six months endedJune 30,              2012     2011      Change      2012     2011      Change      ENBREL — U.S.   $ 991     $ 894       11 %     $ 1,869     $ 1,715       9 %     ENBREL — Canada     67       62       8 %       127       116       9 %                                                         Total ENBREL   $ 1,058     $ 956       11 %     $ 1,996     $ 1,831       9 %                                                        The increases in total ENBREL sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, were driven primarily by increases in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, increases in unit demand and wholesaler inventories.

The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the six months ended June 30, 2012, was driven primarily by a decline in unit demand, offset partially by an increase in the average net sales price and by a year-over-year change in accounting estimates. The unit declines reflect segment contraction resulting from changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred during 2011.  The decreases in ROW Aranesp® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, were due primarily to decreases in the average net sales price.  Future Aranesp® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. Certain of those factors may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp®.

The declines comprised 26% and 28% decreases in unit demand for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, driven by reductions in dose utilization. These decreases    29    Table of Contents  were offset partially by reductions in customer discounts, as part of new provider contracts that became effective January 1, 2012, and by a year-over-year change in accounting estimates of $43 million during the three months ended June 30, 2012.  EPOGEN® sales increased 18% in the quarter ended June 30, 2012, as compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2012, driven by customer and wholesaler buying patterns and a low-single-digit-percentage-point growth in underlying unit demand.  Future EPOGEN® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2012.

Excluding the impacts of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 14.2% and 14.3% of product sales for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 14.8% of product sales for both the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011.  Research and development  R&D expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, were flat versus the same periods in 2011. Expenses in support of our later-stage clinical programs, including AMG 145 and AMG 785, increased $72 million and $118 million, respectively. These increases were offset by reductions in expenses associated with marketed product support of $53 million and $62 million and expenses in support of Discovery Research and Translational Sciences of $12 million and $49 million, respectively. R&D expenses are expected to increase in the second half of 2012 relative to the first half.  Selling, general and administrative  The increases in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, were driven primarily by higher ENBREL profit share expenses of $37 million and $62 million as well as international expansion of $39 million and $56 million, respectively. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2012, was offset partially by a favorable change to the estimated 2011 U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee of $42 million.  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share were $371 million and $695 million, and $334 million and $633 million, respectively.  Other  Other operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, included certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives of $69 million and $70 million, respectively.    31    Table of Contents Non-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes  Non-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                Three months endedJune 30,     Six months endedJune 30,        2012     2011     2012     2011     Interest expense, net   $ 256     $ 122     $ 491     $ 257     Interest and other income, net   $ 124     $ 129     $ 248     $ 277     Provisions for income taxes   $ 191     $ 169     $ 373     $ 350     Effective tax rate     13.1%       12.6%       13.2%       13.2%    Interest expense, net  The increases in interest expense, net, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, were due primarily to a higher average debt balance.  Interest and other income, net  The decreases in interest and other income, net, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, were due primarily to lower net realized gains on investments, offset partially by higher interest income due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.  Income taxes  Our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, were 13.1% and 13.2%, respectively, compared with 12.6% and 13.2% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2012, was due primarily to the exclusion of the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit (the federal R&D tax credit expired as of December 31, 2011, and was not reinstated as of June 30, 2012) offset partially by changes in revenue and expense mix. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2012, was unchanged as the increase due to the exclusion of the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit was offset by changes in revenue and expense mix, including adjustments to the non-deductible healthcare reform federal excise fee. Our effective tax rates without the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, would have been 18.5% and 18.6%, respectively, compared with 18.4% and 18.6% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.  See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  Financial condition, liquidity and capital resources  Selected financial data was as follows (in millions):                      June 30,2012     December 31,2011     Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities   $ 22,475     $ 20,641     Total assets     52,226       48,871     Current portion of long-term debt     2,416       84     Long-term debt     21,962       21,344     Stockholders’ equity     19,239       19,029    The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, Item 1A. Risk Factors—There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.) In October 2011, we announced our    32    Table of Contents  intent to accelerate our stock repurchase program and that our Board of Directors had authorized an increase in our stock repurchase program to $10 billion, reflecting our confidence in the long-term value of the Company and the attractive interest rate environment. Subsequent to the October 2011 Board of Directors authorization through December 2011, we repurchased 83.3 million shares at an aggregate cost of $5.0 billion. During the six months ended June 30, 2012, we repurchased 38.4 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $2.6 billion. This brings the total shares repurchased under this approved program to 122 million at a total cost of $7.6 billion at an average price of $62.75 per share. As of June 30, 2012, $2.4 billion remained available under this stock repurchase program. In December 2011 and March 2012, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.36 per share of common stock, which were paid on March 7 and June 7, 2012, respectively, and totaled $565 million. On July 19, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share of common stock, which will be paid on September 7, 2012, to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 16, 2012.  We believe existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in each case for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as “U.S. funds”) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to repurchase stock and pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. During the three months ended June 30, 2012, we issued an additional $3.0 billion of long-term debt, and we now have adequate U.S. funding to complete the $10 billion of stock repurchases authorized under our stock repurchase program. Our 2013 Convertible Notes mature in the first quarter of 2013 and are included in the current portion of long-term debt at $2.4 billion. We are currently considering alternatives to refinance that obligation. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Current global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.  A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside of the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent, in part, on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and the trend has worsened over time as regional economic uncertainty has increased. We did collect $197 million under a government-funded program in Spain during the three months ended June 30, 2012. However, deteriorating credit and economic conditions in southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of June 30, 2012, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $427 million, of which $288 million was past due, with the past due receivables primarily in Italy, Spain and Portugal. Although economic conditions in this region may continue affecting the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we may not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary.  Over the next several years, many of the existing patents on our principal products will expire. As a result, we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars that may have a material adverse impact on our product sales, results of operations and liquidity. Upon patent expiration for small molecule products, there is typically intense competition from generics manufacturers, which generally leads to significant and rapid declines in sales of the branded product. Given that our principal products are biologics, we do not believe the impact of biosimilar competition will be as significant as with small molecule products, in part because successful competitors must have a broad range of specialized skills and capabilities unique to biologics, including significant regulatory, clinical and manufacturing expertise, and since the products are similar but not identical, the biosimilars will have to compete against products with established efficacies and safety records. We have many opportunities to grow our business, including the continued commercialization of XGEVA® and Prolia® and expansion into emerging markets and Japan, which we believe may offset the adverse financial impact of our principal products’ patent expiries.  Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of June 30, 2012.    33    Table of Contents Cash flows  Our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions):                      Six months ended June 30,        2012     2011     Net cash provided by operating activities   $ 3,347     $ 2,566     Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities     (4,786 )      291     Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities     342       (146 )   Operating  Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2012, increased due primarily to the timing and amount of receipts from customers (including $197 million received under a government-funded program in Spain), cash received in connection with the termination of our interest rate swap agreements of $397 million and the impact of decreased inventory-related expenditures, offset partially by the timing and amount of payments to taxing authorities and others.  Investing  Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2012, was due primarily to net purchases of marketable securities of $2.7 billion and the acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired of $1.7 billion. Cash provided by investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2011, was due primarily to net sales of marketable securities of $1.2 billion, offset partially by cash used to acquire businesses, net of cash acquired of $701 million.  Capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, totaled $316 million and $223 million, respectively. Capital expenditures during both the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, were associated primarily with manufacturing-capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and other site developments. We currently estimate 2012 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.  Financing  Cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2012, was due primarily to the issuance of long-term debt of $3.0 billion and the net proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the Company’s equity award programs of $584 million, offset partially by repurchases of our common stock of $2.6 billion, payment of dividends of $565 million and repayment of $102 million of long-term debt.  Cash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2011, was due to the repayment of $2.5 billion of long-term debt and repurchases of our common stock of $745 million, offset partially by the issuance of long-term debt of $3.0 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company’s equity award program of $113 million.  See Note 9, Financing arrangements, and Note 10, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  Critical accounting policies  The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies in the six months ended June 30, 2012.    34    Table of Contents   Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Information about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, and is incorporated herein by reference. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes for the six months ended June 30, 2012, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.  During the three months ended June 30, 2012, due to historically low interest rates, we terminated all of our interest rate swap contracts which had an aggregate notional amount of $3.6 billion, resulting in the receipt of $397 million from the counterparties. This amount will be recognized in earnings over the remaining lives of the debt issuances that were related to these interest rate swap contracts and will not significantly impact earnings for any fiscal year.      Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as the term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2012.  Management determined that, as of June 30, 2012, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    35    Table of Contents PART II — OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  See Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2012, and March 31, 2012, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. These discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.      Item 1A.  RISK FACTORS  This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, the primary risks related to our business and periodically update those risks for material developments. These risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.  There are no material updates from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, and in Part II, Item IA, of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2012.    36    Table of Contents   Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.  During the three months ended June 30, 2012, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program. Our repurchase activity for the three months ended June 30, 2012, was as follows:                                Total numberof sharespurchased     Averageprice paidper share     Total number ofshares purchasedas part of publiclyannounced program     Maximum dollarvalue that mayyet be purchasedunder the program(1)     April 1 - April 30     4,702,600     $ 67.38       4,702,600     $ 3,246,696,626     May 1 - May 31     6,546,600       69.64       6,546,600       2,790,822,264     June 1 - June 30     6,104,100       70.46       6,104,100       2,360,701,144                                         17,353,300       69.31       17,353,300                                             (1)   On October 13, 2011, our Board of Directors increased the authorization for repurchase of our common stock to an aggregate of $10 billion.      Item 5.  OTHER INFORMATION  Takeda  In 2011, we announced that the motesanib pivotal phase 3 trial (MONET1) had not met its primary objective of demonstrating an improvement in overall survival. On June 29, 2012, we and Takeda terminated the License Agreement for motesanib dated as of February 1, 2008. At the same time, we and Takeda entered into a new commercial agreement licensing all of our rights to motesanib to Takeda and granting Takeda control over the worldwide development, manufacture and commercialization of motesanib. (See Note 5, Collaborative arrangements, in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this quarterly report.)
