Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in this Note; in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016; and in Notes 12 and 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively.We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.Our legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to a class action with thousands of putative class members. These legal proceedings, as well as other matters, involve various aspects of our business and a variety of claims—including but not limited to patent infringement, marketing, pricing and trade practices and securities law—some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. In each of the matters described in this filing, in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, or in Notes 12 or 13, Contingencies and commitments, to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively, plaintiffs seek an award of a not-yet-quantified amount of damages or an amount that is not material. In addition, a number of the matters pending against us are at very early stages of the legal process (which in complex proceedings of the sort faced by us often extend for several years). As a result, none of the matters pending against us described in this filing, in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, or in Notes 12 or 13, Contingencies and 23commitments, to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively, have progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate a range of possible loss, if any, or such amounts are not material. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these matters, an adverse determination in one or more of these matters currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings and other matters are discussed below:PCSK9 Antibody Patent LitigationU.S. Patent Litigation—Sanofi/RegeneronOn October 5, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Federal Circuit Court) reversed-in-part the judgment of the U.S. District Court for Delaware (the Delaware District Court) and remanded for a new trial two of defendants’ patent validity defenses (failure to meet the law’s requirements for patentability of written description and enablement of the claimed inventions) and affirmed the Delaware District Court’s judgment of infringement of claims 2, 7, 9, 15, 19 and 29 of U.S. Patent No. 8,829,165 and claim 7 of U.S. Patent No. 8,859,741 and patent validity on the defendants’ third patent validity defense (finding that the claimed inventions were not obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field of the patents). The Federal Circuit Court also vacated and remanded for further consideration by the Delaware District Court the permanent injunction granted by the Delaware District Court prohibiting the infringing manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or import of alirocumab in the United States. Sensipar® (cinacalcet) LitigationSensipar® Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) Patent LitigationAs previously disclosed, Amgen has filed 18 separate lawsuits against defendants for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 9,375,405 (the ‘405 Patent), and 15 of these 18 lawsuits have been consolidated by the Delaware District Court. Amgen filed and the court signed stipulated dismissals of the lawsuits against defendants Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex), on September 11, 2017, and against defendants Micro Labs Ltd. and Micro Labs USA, Inc., on September 20, 2017. On September 21, 2017, the Delaware District Court signed a consent judgment filed by Amgen and Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Breckenridge) stipulating to entry of judgment of infringement and validity of the ‘405 Patent and an injunction prohibiting the manufacture, use, sale, offer to sell, importation of, or distribution into the United States of the Breckenridge cinacalcet product during the term of the ‘405 Patent unless specifically authorized pursuant to the confidential settlement agreement. In addition, during September 2017, defendants Macleods Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. filed motions for judgment on the pleadings and to dismiss the complaint pending against them and Amgen filed oppositions to such motions.Sensipar® Pediatric Exclusivity LitigationAs previously disclosed, Amgen filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking effectively to reverse the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) May 22, 2017 rejection of Amgen’s request for pediatric exclusivity for cinacalcet hydrochloride (Sensipar®/ Mimpara®). On August 10, 2017, the court entered an expedited scheduling order for Amgen and the FDA to file cross-motions for summary judgment and a hearing on such motions is set for December 15, 2017. Amgen filed its motion for summary judgment on October 18, 2017. KYPROLIS® (carfilzomib) ANDA Patent LitigationAs previously disclosed, the Delaware District Court consolidated ten separate lawsuits filed by our subsidiary Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. (Onyx Therapeutics) against defendants for infringement of certain of our patents. On August 17, 2017, Onyx Therapeutics filed an additional lawsuit in the Delaware District Court against InnoPharma, Inc. for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,232,818 (the ‘818 Patent); 7,491,704 (the ‘704 Patent); 8,129,346 (the ‘346 Patent); 8,207,125 (the ‘125 Patent); 8,207,126 (the ‘126 Patent); and 8,207,127 (the ‘127 Patent). Onyx Therapeutics filed two additional lawsuits in the Delaware District Court against Apotex, on August 24, 2017, and Qilu Pharma, Inc. and Qilu Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (collectively Qilu), on August 30, 2017, for infringement of the ‘818, ‘704, ‘346, ‘125, ‘126, ‘127 Patents and U.S. Patent Nos. 7,417,042 and 8,207,297. In each lawsuit, Onyx Therapeutics seeks an order of the Delaware District Court making any FDA approval of the defendant’s ANDA effective no earlier than the expiration of the applicable patents. On September 14, 2017, the Delaware District Court consolidated these three additional lawsuits for purposes of discovery into the existing consolidated case. Responses to these new complaints have been filed by InnoPharma, Inc., Apotex and Qilu alleging invalidity and, in certain instances, non-infringement of the patents. On September 20, 2017, by joint stipulation of the parties, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. was dismissed from one of the previously-filed lawsuits, leaving Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. as the remaining defendant in that litigation.24Amgen Biosimilars LitigationAMJEVITA™ (adalimumab-atto) Patent LitigationOn September 27, 2017, Amgen and AbbVie Inc. and AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd.

Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie will grant patent licenses for the use and sale of Amgen’s AMJEVITA™/AMGEVITA™ (a biosimilar to AbbVie’s HUMIRA® (adalimumab)) worldwide, on a country-by-country basis, and the companies have agreed to dismiss pending patent litigation. The agreement allows Amgen to begin marketing AMJEVITA™/AMGEVITA™ in the various countries at specified dates. On September 28, 2017, the Delaware District Court entered a stipulation to dismiss all claims and counterclaims of this litigation.MVASI™ (bevacizumab-awwb) Patent LitigationOn October 6, 2017, Amgen filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against Genentech, Inc. (Genentech) and the City of Hope seeking a declaratory judgment that 27 patents listed by Genentech in the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) exchange are invalid, unenforceable and not infringed by MVASI™, formerly ABP 215, Amgen’s biosimilar of Avastin® (bevacizumab). On October 7, 2017, Genentech and City of Hope filed a separate lawsuit in the Delaware District Court alleging Amgen’s infringement of 24 of the 27 patents which are the subject of the lawsuit in California. On October 10, 2017, Amgen filed a motion to transfer Genentech’s first Delaware lawsuit to California. On October 18, 2017, Genentech and City of Hope filed a second lawsuit in the Delaware District Court alleging Amgen’s infringement of 25 of the same 27 patents, and on October 23, 2017, Amgen filed a motion to transfer Genentech’s second Delaware lawsuit to California.Other Biosimilars Patent LitigationWe have filed a number of lawsuits against manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products. In each case, our complaint alleges that the manufacturer’s actions infringe certain patents we hold and may also allege that the manufacturer has failed to comply with certain provisions of the BPCIA. Additionally, a number of manufacturers have challenged the validity of our applicable patents and/or contended that such patents are not infringed by such manufacturers’ biosimilar products.Filgrastim/Pegfilgrastim LitigationSandoz (pegfilgrastim). Trial for this patent infringement case is scheduled for March 26, 2018. Sandoz (filgrastim). On September 13, 2017, by joint stipulation of the parties, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the California Northern District Court) dismissed from the case the parties’ respective claims and counterclaims related to U.S. Patent No. 6,162,427. Trial for the remaining patent infringement claim is scheduled for March 26, 2018.As previously disclosed, Sandoz filed a request of the Federal Circuit Court to remand the BPCIA litigation to the California Northern District Court to allow that court to address the questions of California law. On August 28, 2017, at the request of the Federal Circuit Court, the parties filed supplemental briefs stating their respective positions on the appropriate action to be taken by the California Northern District Court on remand.Apotex (pegfilgrastim/filgrastim). On October 3, 2017, the Federal Circuit Court heard argument on Amgen’s appeal of the judgment of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida finding that Apotex’s process of manufacturing its filgrastim and pegfilgrastim products do not infringe our U.S. Patent No. 8,952,138. Coherus (pegfilgrastim). As previously disclosed, Amgen filed a lawsuit in the Delaware District Court against Coherus BioSciences, Inc. (Coherus) for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 8,273,707 (the ‘707 Patent). A claim construction hearing is scheduled for June 25, 2018, and trial is scheduled to commence on September 16, 2019. Mylan (pegfilgrastim). On September 22, 2017, Amgen and Amgen Manufacturing, Limited (AML) filed a lawsuit in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against Mylan Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc., Mylan GmbH, and Mylan N.V. (collectively, Mylan) for infringement of our ‘707 Patent and U.S. Patent No. 9,643,997 (the ‘997 Patent). This lawsuit stems from Mylan’s submission of an application for FDA licensure of a pegfilgrastim product as biosimilar to Amgen’s Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) under the BPCIA. By their complaint, Amgen and AML seek, among other remedies, an injunction prohibiting Mylan from infringing the ‘707 and ‘997 Patents.25Etanercept LitigationSandoz (etanercept). On September 14, 2017, Amgen filed a motion for summary judgment that Sandoz infringed claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 8,722,631 and, on October 23, 2017, Sandoz filed its brief in opposition to the motion. Coherus (etanercept). On August 4, 2017, Coherus filed a petition seeking to institute inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial Appeal Board (PTAB) to challenge the patentability of each claim of U.S. Patent No. 8,163,522 (the ‘522 Patent). On September 7, 2017, Coherus filed a second IPR petition, seeking to institute PTAB proceedings to challenge the patentability of each claim of U.S. Patent No. 8,063,182 (the ‘182 Patent). Both the ‘522 Patent and the ‘182 Patent relate to Enbrel® (etanercept) and are exclusively licensed to our subsidiary Immunex Corporation by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. The deadlines to file a patent owner preliminary response to the Coherus IPR petition regarding the ‘522 Patent and the ‘182 Patent are December 13, 2017 and December 26, 2017, respectively, and the deadlines expected for the PTAB to render a decision regarding whether to institute PTAB trial proceedings on the ‘522 Patent and the ‘182 Patent are March 13, 2018 and March 26, 2018, respectively. Epoetin Alfa LitigationHospira (epoetin alfa). On September 7, 2017, the Delaware District Court denied a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the patents-in-suit by Hospira, Inc. (Hospira), a subsidiary of Pfizer. On September 22, 2017, after a five day jury trial, the jury returned a verdict finding U.S. Patent No. 5,856,298 (the ‘298 Patent) valid and infringed by Hospira and U.S. Patent No. 5,756,349 (the ‘349 Patent) not infringed. The jury awarded Amgen $70 million in damages for Hospira’s infringement. On October 23, 2017, Amgen moved for judgment as a matter of law that Hospira infringed the ‘349 Patent or, in the alternative, for a new trial on infringement of the ‘349 Patent. In addition, on October 23, 2017, Hospira moved for judgment as a matter of law of non-infringement and invalidity of the ‘298 Patent or, in the alternative, for reduction of the damage award or a new trial on the ‘298 Patent. State Derivative LitigationOn July 3, 2017, defendants in this state stockholder derivative lawsuit filed demurrers seeking dismissal of all claims. A hearing on the demurrers was held on October 6, 2017.ERISA LitigationOn August 10, 2017, the remaining plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his appeal of the settlement reached in this case.U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts - Patient Assistance InvestigationAmgen, together with other companies in our industry, has received inquiries from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts relating to support of charitable 501(c)(3) organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients. Amgen is cooperating with this ongoing inquiry.26Item 2.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017.

For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017.Products/PipelineBone HealthProlia® •In October 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Prolia® for the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. The sBLA is based on a phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Prolia® compared with risedronate in patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of May 28, 2018. 27CardiovascularRepatha® •In July 2017, we announced that the FDA granted priority review for the sBLA for Repatha® to include risk reduction of major cardiovascular events in the Repatha® label. The FDA has set a PDUFA target action date of December 2, 2017. •In October 2017, the Federal Circuit Court issued a ruling that reversed the Delaware District Court’s decision which prohibited Sanofi, Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, Aventisub LLC, formerly doing business as Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. from infringing two patents that we hold for Repatha® by manufacturing, using, selling, offering for sale or importing alirocumab in the United States. See Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.•In October 2017, we announced that a phase 3 study of Repatha® on top of maximally tolerated statin therapy in type 2 diabetic patients with hypercholesterolemia met its co-primary endpoints of the percent reduction from baseline in LDL-C at week 12 and the mean percent reduction from baseline in LDL-C at weeks 10 and 12. No new safety findings were identified.Oncology/HematologyAranesp® •In October 2017, we announced that after a recommendation by the data safety monitoring committee, a phase 3 post-marketing requirement study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Aranesp® in anemic patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy was terminated early. The study successfully met its primary end point of non-inferiority in overall survival compared to placebo, with no new safety findings.KYPROLIS® •In August 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for review a supplemental New Drug Application based on the overall survival data from the phase 3 head-to-head ENDEAVOR (RandomizEd, OpeN Label, Phase 3 Study of Carfilzomib Plus DExamethAsone Vs Bortezomib Plus DexamethasOne in Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma) study demonstrating KYPROLIS® and dexamethasone (Kd) reduced the risk of death by 21 percent and increased overall survival by 7.6 months versus Velcade® (bortezomib) and dexamethasone (Vd) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The FDA has set a PDUFA target action date of April 30, 2018.•In October 2017, we announced top-line results of the phase 3 A.R.R.O.W. (RAndomized, Open-label, Phase 3 Study in Subjects with Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma Receiving Carfilzomib in Combination with Dexamethasone, Comparing Once-Weekly versus Twice-weekly Carfilzomib Dosing) study, which showed KYPROLIS® administered once-weekly at the 70 mg/m2 dose with dexamethasone allowed relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients to live 3.6 months longer without their disease worsening than KYPROLIS® administered twice-weekly at the 27 mg/m2 dose with dexamethasone. The overall safety profile of the once-weekly KYPROLIS® regimen was comparable to that of the twice-weekly regimen.NephrologySensipar®/Mimpara®  •In August 2017, we announced that the European Commission granted Marketing Authorization of a pediatric formulation (granules in capsule for opening) of Mimpara® for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) in children aged three years and older with end-stage renal disease on maintenance dialysis therapy in whom sHPT is not adequately controlled with standard of care therapy.BiosimilarsABP 980•In October 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for review a Biologics License Application for ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin® (trastuzumab).

The increase in other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was driven primarily by higher Ibrance® royalty income, offset partially by lower milestone payments received.The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2017, was driven primarily by net charges associated with the discontinuance of the internal development of AMG 899, offset partially by the expiration of ENBREL residual royalty payments and lower external business development expenses. The decrease in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was driven primarily by the expiration of ENBREL residual royalty payments and lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs, offset partially by net charges associated with the discontinuance of the internal development of AMG 899. All expense categories benefited from our continued transformation and process improvement efforts. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2017, was relatively flat. The increase in diluted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2017, was driven primarily by lower weighted-average diluted shares. The increases in net income and diluted EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, were driven primarily by higher operating margins.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016.29Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 ChangeENBREL$1,363 $1,452 (6)% $4,010 $4,321 (7)%Neulasta®1,123 1,200 (6)% 3,420 3,532 (3)%Aranesp®516 531 (3)% 1,562 1,567 — %Prolia® 464 379 22 % 1,394 1,172 19 %Sensipar®/Mimpara®457 415 10 % 1,305 1,171 11 %XGEVA® 387 394 (2)% 1,184 1,153 3 %EPOGEN®264 335 (21)% 826 966 (14)%Other products879 810 9 % 2,525 2,347 8 %Total product sales$5,453 $5,516 (1)% $16,226 $16,229 — %Future sales of our products are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others.

For the full year 2017, we expect a decline in unit demand and a slight decline in net selling price, both of which we expect to continue in 2018.Neulasta® Total Neulasta® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2017 2016 Change  2017 2016 ChangeNeulasta®— U.S.$977 $1,024 (5)% $2,962 $2,982 (1)%Neulasta®— ROW146 176 (17)% 458 550 (17)%Total Neulasta®$1,123 $1,200 (6)% $3,420 $3,532 (3)%The decrease in global Neulasta® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2017, was driven primarily by a decline in unit demand.30The decrease in global Neulasta® sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was driven primarily by a decline in unit demand, offset partially by an increase in net selling price and favorable changes in accounting estimates. As of September 30, 2017, utilization of the Neulasta® Onpro® kit continued to grow in the United States.We expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Neulasta®. Multiple companies have announced applications to the FDA for proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta®. Three of these companies have announced receipt of Complete Response Letters from the FDA regarding their applications.Future Neulasta® sales will also depend in part on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2017 2016 Change  2017 2016 ChangeAranesp® — U.S.$285 $275 4 % $851 $796 7 %Aranesp® — ROW231 256 (10)% 711 771 (8)%Total Aranesp®$516 $531 (3)% $1,562 $1,567 — %The decrease in global Aranesp® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2017, was driven primarily by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower unit demand. The decrease in global Aranesp® sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was driven primarily by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, offset partially by a shift by some U.S. dialysis customers from EPOGEN® to Aranesp®. Aranesp® may face competition in the United States from branded products, as well as proposed short-acting biosimilars.Prolia® Total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 ChangeProlia® — U.S.$298 $249 20% $903 $756 19%Prolia® — ROW166 130 28% 491 416 18%Total Prolia®$464 $379 22% $1,394 $1,172 19%The increases in global Prolia® sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, were driven primarily by higher unit demand.Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2017 2016 Change 20172016 ChangeSensipar® — U.S.$373 $329 13 % $1,052 $910 16 %Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW84 86 (2)% 253 261 (3)%Total Sensipar®/Mimpara®$457 $415 10 % $1,305 $1,171 11 %The increases in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, were driven primarily by an increase in net selling price.31Our U.S. composition of matter patent relating to Sensipar®, a small molecule, expires in March 2018. We are also involved in a number of litigation matters related to Sensipar®. See Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Multiple companies are developing proposed biosimilar versions of EPOGEN®. One company has announced receipt of a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding its application.32Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 ChangeKYPROLIS® — U.S.$135 $140 (4)% $412 $411 — %KYPROLIS® — ROW72 43 67 % 196 98 100 %Vectibix® — U.S.65 64 2 % 188 172 9 %Vectibix® — ROW103 100 3 % 295 296 — %Nplate® — U.S.96 92 4 % 292 262 11 %Nplate® — ROW63 59 7 % 185 172 8 %NEUPOGEN® — U.S.96 127 (24)% 287 418 (31)%NEUPOGEN® — ROW42 56 (25)% 136 174 (22)%Repatha® — U.S.62 31 100 % 155 65 *Repatha® — ROW27 9 * 66 18 *BLINCYTO®—U.S.34 19 79 % 85 61 39 %BLINCYTO®—ROW18 10 80 % 44 25 76 %Other — U.S.21 14 50 % 55 41 34 %Other — ROW45 46 (2)% 129 134 (4)%Total other products$879 $810 9 % $2,525 $2,347 8 %Total U.S. — other products$509 $487 5 % $1,474 $1,430 3 %Total ROW — other products370 323 15 % 1,051 917 15 %Total other products$879 $810 9 % $2,525 $2,347 8 %* Change in excess of 100%Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2017 2016 Change  2017 2016 ChangeCost of sales$990 $1,027 (4)% $3,010 $3,095 (3)%% of product sales18.2% 18.6%   18.6% 19.1%  % of total revenues17.1% 17.7%   17.7% 18.2%  Research and development$877 $990 (11)% $2,519 $2,762 (9)%% of product sales16.1% 17.9%   15.5% 17.0%  % of total revenues15.2% 17.0%   14.8% 16.2%  Selling, general and administrative$1,170 $1,244 (6)% $3,443 $3,739 (8)%% of product sales21.5% 22.6%   21.2% 23.0%  % of total revenues20.3% 21.4%   20.2% 22.0%  Other$297 $23 * $347 $121 ** Change in excess of 100%33Transformation and process improvementsDuring 2014, we announced transformation and process improvement efforts that we continue to execute. As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders.The transformation includes a restructuring plan that we continue to estimate will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $800 million to $900 million. As of September 30, 2017, restructuring costs incurred to date were $771 million. The charges that were recorded related to the restructuring during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, were not significant. Since 2014, we have realized approximately $1.3 billion of transformation and process improvement savings. Net savings have not been significant as savings were reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. Puerto Rico operationsSince Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in September 2017, we have been providing support to our staff members and the local community while implementing business continuity plans and restoring manufacturing operations at our site in Juncos. All of our staff in Puerto Rico have been accounted for and nearly all are back at work. Our drug substance manufacturing and packaging plants are fully operational and we expect to resume formulation/filling and small molecule commercial production by the end of October 2017. We continue to provide an uninterrupted supply of medicines for patients around the world.We incurred $67 million of pre-tax expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2017, related to Hurricane Maria. In the three months ending December 31, 2017, we expect additional pre-tax expenses in the range of $75 million to $100 million. At this time, we do not expect significant pre-tax expenses in 2018. These estimates do not include possible insurance recoveries.Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 17.1% of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2017, driven primarily by a reduction in amortization of intangible assets and manufacturing efficiencies, offset partially by expenses related to Hurricane Maria. Cost of sales decreased to 17.7% of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, driven primarily by manufacturing efficiencies. The excise tax imposed by the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico excise tax) is recorded as a cost of sales expense. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 15.6% and 16.1% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared with 16.1% and 16.5% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe decrease in R&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2017, was driven primarily by lower external business development expense in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences (DRTS) and lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs. The costs associated with DRTS and later-stage clinical programs decreased by $73 million and $44 million, respectively. The costs associated with marketed products were relatively unchanged. The decrease in R&D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was driven primarily by lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs and lower external business development expense in DRTS. The costs associated with our later-stage clinical programs, DRTS and marketed products decreased by $116 million, $73 million and $54 million, respectively. Selling, general and administrativeThe decrease in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2017, was driven primarily by the expiration of ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016, offset partially by investments in product launches. The decrease in SG&A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was driven primarily by the expiration of ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016, as well as a charge related to an acquisition in the three months ended March 31, 2016, offset partially by investments in product launches. 34OtherOther operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, included net charges associated with the discontinuance of the internal development of AMG 899 and certain net charges related to our restructuring plan. Other operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, included the impairment of a non-key contract asset acquired in a prior year business combination. Other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, included legal-proceeding charges of $105 million.Non-operating expense/income and income taxesNon-operating expense/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30, Nine months endedSeptember 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016Interest expense, net$325 $325 $972 $932Interest and other income, net$267 $216 $627 $503Provision for income taxes$360 $401 $1,140 $1,093Effective tax rate15.1% 16.6% 15.4% 15.9%Interest expense, netThe increase in Interest expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was due primarily to a higher average amount of debt outstanding.Interest and other income, netThe increase in Interest and other income, net, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, was due primarily to higher interest income that resulted from higher average investment balances.Income taxes The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2017, was due primarily to favorable tax impacts of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses, as well as discrete benefits associated with the impairment of our AMG 899 asset and the related release of contingent consideration liabilities connected with the acquisition of Dezima, offset partially by adjustments to certain federal tax credits and deductions.The decrease in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was due primarily to favorable tax impacts of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses, as well as discrete benefits associated with the effective settlement of certain state and federal tax matters, offset partially by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation payments and adjustments to certain federal tax credits and deductions.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, would have been 17.8% and 18.2%, respectively, compared with 19.4% and 18.8%, respectively, for the corresponding periods of the prior year.As previously disclosed, we received a RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We are in discussions with the IRS examination team and understand that the RAR may be modified. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution through the IRS administrative appeals process, which we believe will likely not be concluded within the next 12 months. Final resolution of the IRS audit could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows if not resolved favorably, however, we believe our income tax reserves are appropriately provided for all open tax years.See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.35Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data were as follows (in millions): September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$41,351 $38,085Total assets$80,331 $77,626Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt$1,999 $4,403Long-term debt$33,777 $30,193Stockholders’ equity$32,229 $29,875We intend to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amounts of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amounts of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. In July 2017, March 2017 and December 2016, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.15 per share of common stock, which were paid on September 8, June 8 and March 8, 2017, respectively. In October 2017, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.15 per share of common stock, which will be paid on December 8, 2017.We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we repurchased $2.3 billion of our stock and paid $2.4 billion in cash during the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased $2.0 billion of our stock. As of September 30, 2017, $1.7 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program. In October 2017, the Board of Directors authorized an increase that resulted in a total of $5.0 billion available under the stock repurchase program. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. During the second quarter of 2017, we began borrowing under our $2.5 billion commercial paper program and as of September 30, 2017, we had $1.5 billion outstanding under this program. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively, U.S. funds) are adequate to continue meeting our U.S. obligations, including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds, for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaling $41.4 billion as of September 30, 2017, approximately $38.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of September 30, 2017.36Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Nine months endedSeptember 30, 2017 2016Net cash provided by operating activities$8,165 $7,254Net cash used in investing activities$(3,946) $(7,436)Net cash used in financing activities$(4,460) $(477)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2017, increased compared with the same period in the prior year due primarily to an increase in net income, offset partially by the timing of payments to taxing authorities.InvestingCash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $3.3 billion and capital expenditures of $511 million. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $6.7 billion and capital expenditures of $511 million. Capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in various locations, as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2017 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was due primarily to payment of dividends of $2.5 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $2.4 billion and repayment of long-term debt, net of proceeds from issuances, of $920 million, offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper of $1.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $2.3 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $2.0 billion, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of repayments, of $4.0 billion. See Note 9, Financing arrangements, and Note 10, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2017.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and is incorporated herein by reference. Except as discussed below, no material changes occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsTo achieve a desired mix of fixed- and floating-interest-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $3.65 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. In addition, we had interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $850 million mature during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. As of September 30, 2017, interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $9.45 billion were outstanding. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-interest-rate coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the 37respective note. A hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at September 30, 2017, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $450 million on our interest rate swap contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income in the ensuing year. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive interests were designed to offset.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2017.Management determined that, as of September 30, 2017, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, 2017 and June 30, 2017, and Note 12, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, provide additional disclosure for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.38We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; if significant disruptions or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials.We currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. In late September 2017, Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm, made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico. The hurricane destroyed residential and commercial buildings, agriculture, communications networks and most of Puerto Rico’s electric grid. The critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly impacted by the storm, and we are in the process of resuming our full manufacturing operations. Puerto Rico officials suggest that it may be months before electrical service is restored to much of the island, and as a result our facility is operating with electrical power from back-up diesel-powered generators. We are currently receiving regular deliveries of diesel fuel under pre-arranged contracts. In addition, supplies of medical-grade oxygen and nitrogen used in biopharmaceutical manufacturing operations are limited on the island, and we have arranged deliveries of both gases from the U.S. mainland and other countries. However, it is possible that we may not be able to secure the fuel needed to continuously operate our back-up generators until electrical power is permanently restored or the medical-grade gases needed to continue our operations until a reliable supply chain can be established. Many locations on the island depend upon electricity to power the pumps that deliver clean water. The breakdown of infrastructure and basic services across the island, including communication (telephone, cellular and internet), transportation, utilities and sanitation, may also make it more difficult, time consuming and expensive for us to operate our manufacturing facility and to get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location. Even if our facility remains operable and accessible, it may become challenging for some of our local staff to return to work or continue to work. While nearly all of our staff have already returned to work, some of them or their families may now or in the future be without housing, access to food and water, electricity, healthcare, childcare, transportation or other essentials, and for these or other reasons may be forced or elect to temporarily or permanently relocate elsewhere on or off the island. A substantial disruption in our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility (whether due to problems with the facility itself, the infrastructure and services available on the island, the unavailability of raw materials or supplies from vendors, the unavailability of key staff or otherwise) could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors— Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. The impact of Hurricane Maria is certain to place greater stress on the island’s already challenged economy. Since June 2015, when the Governor of Puerto Rico announced that the government (including certain government entities) was unable to pay its roughly $72 billion in debt, the government’s liquidity position has continued to deteriorate and public reports indicate that the Puerto Rico government is not making certain payments with respect to its obligations. On June 30, 2016, President Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to provide a mechanism for Puerto Rico to restructure its debt, achieve fiscal responsibility and gain access to capital markets. PROMESA established a federal Financial Oversight and Management Board (Oversight Board) to provide fiscal oversight through the development and approval of fiscal plans and budgets for Puerto Rico and to assist in the debt restructuring. The establishment of the Oversight Board initially provided for an automatic stay of creditor actions against the Puerto Rico government until February 15, 2017, and subsequently extended the automatic stay until May 1, 2017, to pursue voluntary negotiations with the Puerto Rico government’s creditors. On May 3, 2017, after negotiations with creditors were unsuccessful and the automatic stay expired, the Oversight Board approved and certified the filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico of a voluntary petition under Title III of PROMESA for the government of Puerto Rico, following thereafter with similar filings for certain Puerto Rico government entities. Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to, but not identical to, Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Given the severe conditions in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit the island, it is expected that resolution of Puerto Rico’s outstanding debt situation through the PROMESA judicial process will be delayed pending recovery efforts. Additionally, on January 29, 2017, the Puerto Rico government enacted the Puerto Rico Fiscal Emergency and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which, among other things, declared a state of financial emergency in Puerto Rico until May 1, 2017, and authorizes the Governor to designate certain services as essential services, and other services as non-essential in order to prioritize the use of available resources to satisfy Puerto Rico’s obligations. On July 19, 2017, the Puerto Rico government extended the emergency period through December 31, 2017, and authorized the Governor to further extend the emergency period for six-month terms under certain conditions. While PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability, there is still a risk that Puerto Rico’s economic situation prior to Hurricane Maria, as well as the severe impact to the island from the hurricane, could impact the territorial government’s provision of utilities or other services in Puerto 39Rico that we use in the operation of our business, create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, and/or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico.We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure, network connected control systems and data security.We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure, network connected control systems and data security. The breadth, complexity and business process integration of our computer systems and the potential value of our data make these systems targets of service interruption, destruction, malicious intrusion and attack. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees, contractors or others may pose risks that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging us, our patients, customers and/or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or the public. As a global biotechnology company, our systems, those of our third-party service providers, and those of key business partners with which we interact are subject to frequent cyber-attacks. Moreover, as the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. Such attacks could include the deployment of harmful and virulent malware, key loggers, a denial-of-service, delivery of malware through malicious websites, the use of social engineering and/or other means to disrupt business operations or affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, processes, infrastructure and data. For example, a number of recent high-profile cyber-attacks against multi-national peer companies, contractors and government agencies have significantly disrupted business operations or resulted in substantial breaches of personal information. Key business partners, third-party service and product providers and any companies we may acquire face similar risks, and any security breaches of their systems could adversely affect our security, expose our confidential data or leave us without access to important systems, products, raw materials, components, services or information. Although in the past we have experienced cyber-attacks and intrusions into our computer systems, we do not believe such attacks have had a material adverse effect on our operations. While we continue to invest in the protection and monitoring of our critical or sensitive data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or detect all breaches to our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us.Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSDuring the three months ended September 30, 2017, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program and the repurchase activity was as follows: Total numberof sharespurchased Averageprice paidper share Total number ofshares purchasedas part of publicly announced program Maximum dollarvalue that mayyet be purchasedunder the program(1)July 1 - 311,564,921 $174.82 1,564,921 $2,241,110,984August 1 - 311,814,178 $171.12 1,814,178 $1,930,666,113September 1 - 301,001,177 $184.83 1,001,177 $1,745,620,168 4,380,276 $175.58 4,380,276  (1)In October 2017, our Board of Directors authorized an increase that resulted in a total of $5.0 billion available under the stock repurchase program.Item 6.
