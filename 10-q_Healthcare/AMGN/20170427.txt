Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.) We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in this Note; and in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.Our legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to a class action with thousands of putative class members. These legal proceedings, as well as other matters, involve various aspects of our business and a variety of claims—including but not limited to patent infringement, marketing, pricing and trade practices and securities law—some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. In each of the matters described in this filing or in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, plaintiffs seek an award of a not-yet-quantified amount of damages or an amount that is not material. In addition, a number of the matters pending against us are at very early stages of the legal process (which in complex proceedings of the sort faced by us often extend for several years). As a result, none of the matters pending against us described in this filing or in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, have progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate a range of possible loss, if any, or such amounts are not material. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these matters, an adverse determination in one or more of these matters currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings and other matters are discussed below:Sanofi/Regeneron Patent LitigationAs previously disclosed, defendants Sanofi, Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, Aventisub LLC, formerly doing business as Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. appealed the judgment of the U.S. District Court for Delaware (the Delaware District Court) that the patents in suit are valid and infringed by the defendants and the permanent injunction granted by the Delaware District Court prohibiting the infringing manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or import of alirocumab in the United States. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Federal Circuit Court) has scheduled argument on the appeal for June 6, 2017. Sensipar® (cinacalcet) Patent LitigationAs previously disclosed, Amgen filed 13 separate lawsuits in the Delaware District Court for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 9,375,405 (the ‘405 Patent). On February 22, 2017, Amgen filed a lawsuit in the Delaware District Court against Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. and Cadila Healthcare Ltd. (collectively, Zydus). In each of the 14 lawsuits, Amgen seeks an order of the Delaware District Court making any U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the defendants’ generic version of Sensipar® effective no earlier than the expiration of the ‘405 Patent. In each lawsuit, all defendants except Zydus have responded to the complaint denying infringement and seeking judgment that the ‘405 Patent is invalid and/or not infringed. On February 23, 212017, and on April 6, 2017, for Zydus, the Delaware District Court consolidated the 14 lawsuits into a single case. The Delaware District Court has scheduled trial for March 5, 2018.KYPROLIS® (carfilzomib) Patent LitigationAs previously disclosed, our subsidiary Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. (Onyx Therapeutics) filed nine separate lawsuits in the Delaware District Court for infringing certain of our patents. On April 18, 2017, the Delaware District Court consolidated these nine lawsuits for purposes of discovery and scheduled trial for March 11, 2019. On April 20, 2017, Onyx Therapeutics filed a separate lawsuit in the Delaware District Court against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,232,818; 7,417,042; 7,491,704; 7,737,112; 8,129,346; 8,207,125; 8,207,126; 8,207,127; and 8,207,297. These ten lawsuits are based on Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) that seek approval to market generic versions of KYPROLIS® before expiration of the asserted patents. In each lawsuit, Onyx Therapeutics seeks an order of the Delaware District Court making any FDA approval of the defendant’s ANDA effective no earlier than the expiration of the applicable patents. Biosimilar Patent LitigationsWe have filed a number of lawsuits against manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products. In each case, our complaint alleges that the manufacturer’s actions infringe certain patents we hold and that the manufacturer has failed to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA).Sandoz Filgrastim LitigationAs previously disclosed, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on both Sandoz’s petition seeking review of the Federal Circuit Court ruling concluding that a biosimilar applicant must give 180-day advance notice of first marketing and that notice can be given only after the FDA has licensed the biosimilar product and Amgen’s conditional cross-petition seeking review of the Federal Circuit Court’s ruling that the only remedy available when a biosimilar applicant refuses to provide its Biologics License Application is to bring a patent infringement claim. On April 26, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on Sandoz’s petition and Amgen’s conditional cross-petition.Apotex Pegfilgrastim/Filgrastim LitigationOn February 17, 2017, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted a petition filed by Apotex to institute an inter partes review of our U.S. Patent No. 9,952,138 (the ‘138 Patent) challenging claims of the ‘138 Patent as unpatentable.Hospira Epoetin Alfa LitigationOn April 3, 2017, the Federal Circuit Court heard arguments on Amgen’s appeal seeking review of the Delaware District Court’s order that Hospira need not provide Amgen discovery of certain of its manufacturing processes that Hospira withheld during the BPCIA dispute resolution process. State Derivative LitigationAs previously disclosed, the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Ventura, lifted the stay in Larson v. Sharer, et al., a state stockholder derivative lawsuit. On March 15, 2017, the plaintiffs in this lawsuit filed a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.ERISA LitigationOn April 5, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final order approving the settlement of this class action lawsuit.22Item 2.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with GAAP. Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.Forward-looking statementsThis report and other documents we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we or others on our behalf may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume” and “continue,” as well as variations of such words and similar expressions, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II herein. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, EPS, liquidity and capital resources, trends, planned dividends, stock repurchases and restructuring plans.

We market several other products as well, including KYPROLIS® (carfilzomib), Nplate® (romiplostim), NEUPOGEN® (filgrastim), Vectibix® (panitumumab), and more recently launched, Repatha® (evolocumab), BLINCYTO® (blinatumomab), IMLYGIC® (talimogene laherparepvec) and Corlanor® (ivabradine).23Significant developments Following is a summary of selected significant developments affecting our business that have occurred since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2016. For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Products/PipelineBone HealthXGEVA® •In April 2017, we announced the submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA and an application for a variation to the marketing authorization to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for XGEVA®. The submissions to regulatory authorities seek to expand the currently approved XGEVA® indication for the prevention of skeletal-related events in solid tumors to include patients with multiple myeloma. CardiovascularRepatha® •In February 2017, we announced that the European Commission (EC) adopted a decision to change the Repatha® marketing authorization, approving a new single-dose, monthly delivery option. The new automated mini-doser with a pre-filled cartridge is a hands-free device that provides 420 mg of Repatha® in a single injection per administration.•In March 2017, we announced that the Phase 3 study evaluating Repatha® in patients who were receiving apheresis to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) met its primary endpoint.•In March 2017, we announced that the Repatha® cardiovascular outcomes study established for the first time that maximally reducing LDL-C levels with Repatha®, beyond what is possible with the current best therapy alone, leads to a further reduction in major cardiovascular events, including heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations. No new safety concerns were identified. •In March 2017, we announced that the Repatha® cognitive function study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that Repatha® did not negatively impact cognition when added to optimized statin therapy.NeuroscienceErenumab•In April 2017, we announced an expanded collaboration with Novartis AG (Novartis) for erenumab, which is being investigated for the prevention of migraine. As part of the expanded collaboration, Amgen and Novartis agreed to combine capabilities to co-commercialize erenumab in the United States. Oncology/HematologyBLINCYTO® •In March 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for priority review the sBLA for BLINCYTO® to include overall survival data from the Phase 3 TOWER study. The application also included new data supporting the treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date of August 14, 2017.KYPROLIS® •In February 2017, we announced positive results from a planned overall survival interim analysis of the Phase 3 head-to-head ENDEAVOR (RandomizEd, OpeN Label, Phase 3 Study of Carfilzomib Plus DExamethAsone Vs Bortezomib Plus DexamethasOne in Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma) trial. The study met the key secondary endpoint of overall survival demonstrating that patients with relapse or refractory multiple myeloma treated with KYPROLIS® and dexamethasone lived 7.6 months longer than those treated with VELCADE® (bortezomib) and dexamethasone.BiosimilarsAMJEVITA™ (adalimumab-atto)/AMGEVITA™ (biosimilar adalimumab) •In March 2017, we announced that the EC granted market authorization for AMGEVITA™ in all available indications. For a discussion of ongoing, related litigation, see Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.24ABP 980•In March 2017, we announced the submission of a Marketing Authorization Application to the EMA for ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin® (trastuzumab). ABP 980 is being developed in collaboration with Allergan plc.Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (dollar and share amounts in millions, except per share data): Three months endedMarch 31,   2017 2016 ChangeProduct sales:     U.S.$4,095 $4,119 (1)%Rest of the world (ROW)1,104 1,120 (1)%Total product sales5,199 5,239 (1)%Other revenues265 288 (8)%Total revenues$5,464 $5,527 (1)%Operating expenses$2,873 $3,125 (8)%Operating income$2,591 $2,402 8 %Net income$2,071 $1,900 9 %Diluted EPS$2.79 $2.50 12 %Diluted shares741 760 (3)%Global product sales decreased one percent for the three months ended March 31, 2017.The decrease in other revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was driven primarily by an upfront payment for a licensing transaction in the prior period, offset partially by higher milestone payments received and higher Ibrance® (palbociclib) royalty income.Operating expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2017. All expense categories benefited from our transformation and process improvement efforts. As in prior years, our operating expenses are expected to be higher in the remaining quarters of the year driven by the timing of expenses.The increases in net income and diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2017, were driven primarily by higher operating margins.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.25Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2017 2016 ChangeNeulasta®$1,210 $1,183 2 %ENBREL1,181 1,385 (15)%Aranesp®511 532 (4)%Prolia® 425 352 21 %Sensipar®/Mimpara®421 367 15 %XGEVA® 402 378 6 %EPOGEN®270 300 (10)%Other products779 742 5 %Total product sales$5,199 $5,239 (1)%Future sales of our products are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others.

As of March 31, 2017, utilization of the Neulasta® OnPro® kit continues to grow in the United States.Future Neulasta® sales will also depend in part on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2017 2016 Change ENBREL — U.S.$1,118 $1,326 (16)%ENBREL — Canada63 59 7 %Total ENBREL$1,181 $1,385 (15)%ENBREL sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017, decreased primarily due to the impact from competition, as well as lower rheumatology and dermatology segment growth compared to prior year. 26Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2017 2016 Change Aranesp® — U.S.$278 $261 7 %Aranesp® — ROW233 271 (14)%Total Aranesp®$511 $532 (4)%The decrease in global Aranesp® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was driven primarily by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, inventory levels and net selling price, offset partially by higher unit demand, including a shift by some U.S. dialysis customers from EPOGEN® to Aranesp®.Aranesp® may face short-acting competition from a proposed biosimilar in the United States.Prolia® Total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2017 2016 ChangeProlia® — U.S.$279 $221 26%Prolia® — ROW146 131 11%Total Prolia®$425 $352 21%The increase in global Prolia® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was driven primarily by higher unit demand.Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2017 2016 ChangeSensipar® — U.S.$337 $278 21 %Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW84 89 (6)%Total Sensipar®/Mimpara®$421 $367 15 %The increase in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price.Our U.S. composition of matter patent relating to Sensipar®, a small molecule, expires in March 2018. We are also involved in litigation with a number of companies seeking to market generic versions of Sensipar® regarding our U.S. formulation patent that expires in September 2026. See Note 12, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.27XGEVA®  Total XGEVA® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2017 2016 ChangeXGEVA® — U.S.$298 $271 10 %XGEVA® — ROW104 107 (3)%Total XGEVA®$402 $378 6 %The increase in global XGEVA® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was driven primarily by higher unit demand.EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2017 2016 ChangeEPOGEN® — U.S.$270 $300 (10)%The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was driven primarily by a decrease in net selling price due to a recently negotiated contract with DaVita Inc.Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2017 2016 ChangeKYPROLIS® — U.S.$137 $129 6 %KYPROLIS® — ROW53 25 *Nplate® — U.S.97 86 13 %Nplate® — ROW57 55 4 %NEUPOGEN® — U.S.101 150 (33)%NEUPOGEN® — ROW47 63 (25)%Vectibix® — U.S.61 56 9 %Vectibix® — ROW86 88 (2)%Repatha® — U.S.33 14 *Repatha® — ROW16 2 *BLINCYTO®—U.S.23 21 10 %BLINCYTO®—ROW11 6 83 %Other — U.S.15 10 50 %Other — ROW42 37 14 %Total other products$779 $742 5 %Total U.S. — other products$467 $466 — %Total ROW — other products312 276 13 %Total other products$779 $742 5 %* Change in excess of 100%28Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2017 2016 Change Cost of sales$996 $1,018 (2)%% of product sales19.2% 19.4%  % of total revenues18.2% 18.4%  Research and development$769 $872 (12)%% of product sales14.8% 16.6%  % of total revenues14.1% 15.8%  Selling, general and administrative$1,064 $1,203 (12)%% of product sales20.5% 23.0%  % of total revenues19.5% 21.8%  Other$44 $32 38 %Transformation and process improvementsDuring 2014, we announced transformation and process improvement efforts that we continue to execute on. As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders.The transformation includes a restructuring plan that will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $800 million to $900 million. As of March 31, 2017, restructuring costs incurred to date were $748 million. The charges that were recorded related to the restructuring during the three months ended March 31, 2017, were not significant. Since 2014, we have realized approximately $1.2 billion of transformation and process improvement savings. Net savings have not been significant as savings were reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 18.2% of total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was driven primarily by manufacturing efficiencies, offset partially by product mix.The excise tax imposed by the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico excise tax) is recorded as a cost of sales expense. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 16.6% and 16.8% of total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe decrease in R&D expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was driven primarily by a payment in the three months ended March 31, 2016, related to a third-party collaboration agreement and lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs.For the three months ended March 31, 2017, costs associated with our later-stage clinical programs and marketed products support decreased by $40 million and $63 million, respectively. Discovery Research and Translational Sciences spend was relatively unchanged for both periods.Selling, general and administrativeThe decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was driven primarily by the expiration of the ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016, as well as a charge related to an acquisition in the three months ended March 31, 2016, offset partially by investments in product launches. 29OtherOther operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017, included certain charges related to our restructuring plan, primarily separation costs. Other operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016, included a legal proceeding charge of $27 million.Non-operating expenses/income and income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31, 2017 2016Interest expense, net$326 $294Interest and other income, net$195 $150Provision for income taxes$389 $358Effective tax rate15.8% 15.9%Interest expense, netThe increase in Interest expense, net, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was due primarily to a higher average amount of debt outstanding.Interest and other income, netThe increase in Interest and other income, net, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was due primarily to higher interest income that resulted from higher average investment balances.Income taxes The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was due primarily to the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses, offset partially by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation payments.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017, would have been 18.5%, compared with 18.8% for the corresponding period of the prior year.During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. The significant proposed adjustments relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and allocate additional profits to the United States. On April 12, 2017, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012 that included the proposed adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and plan to initiate the administrative appeals process, which will likely not be concluded within the next 12 months. Final resolution of the IRS audit could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows if not resolved favorably, however, we believe our income tax reserves are appropriately provided for all open tax years.See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data were as follows (in millions): March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$38,398 $38,085Total assets$77,862 $77,626Current portion of long-term debt$3,799 $4,403Long-term debt$30,293 $30,193Stockholders’ equity$30,637 $29,875We intend to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will 30vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. In March 2017, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.15 per share of common stock, which will be paid on June 8, 2017. In December 2016, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.15 per share of common stock, which was paid on March 8, 2017.We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we repurchased $555 million of our stock and paid $586 million in cash during the period. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we repurchased $690 million of our stock and paid $676 million in cash during the period. As of March 31, 2017, $3.5 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively, U.S. funds) are adequate to continue meeting our U.S. obligations, including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds, for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaling $38.4 billion as of March 31, 2017, approximately $35.0 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of March 31, 2017.Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Three months endedMarch 31, 2017 2016Net cash provided by operating activities$2,385 $1,915Net cash used in investing activities$(157) $(4,390)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities$(2,111) $1,227OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017, increased compared with the same period in the prior year due primarily to the timing of payments to taxing authorities and an increase in net income.InvestingCash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017, was due primarily to capital expenditures of $168 million, offset partially by net activity from marketable securities of $63 million. Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $4.2 billion and capital expenditures of $156 million. Capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in various locations, as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2017 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.31FinancingCash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $847 million, a debt repayment of $605 million and repurchases of our common stock of $586 million. Cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016, was due primarily to proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments, of $2.8 billion, offset partially by the payment of dividends of $752 million and repurchases of our common stock of $676 million.See Note 8, Financing arrangements, and Note 9, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2017.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and is incorporated herein by reference. There have been no material changes during the three months ended March 31, 2017, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2017.Management determined that, as of March 31, 2017, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 12, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and 32assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, provide additional disclosure for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability.Sales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue aggressive initiatives to contain costs and manage drug utilization and are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom our products will be reimbursed by payers. Public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs is increasing and greater focus on pricing and price increases may limit our ability to set or increase the price of our products based on their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from U.S. federal government healthcare programs and private insurance plans regulated by the U.S. federal government. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Part I, Item 1. Business—Reimbursement. Changes to U.S. federal reimbursement policy may come through legislative actions. Discussions continue around a number of potential legislative changes that could affect the reimbursement and/or pricing of our products, including proposals to allow the U.S. federal government to directly negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and to require manufacturers to pay higher rebates in the Medicare Part D setting. Legislation has been introduced into the U.S. Congress for other proposals, including legislation designed to overhaul provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as well as to enable simpler re-importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries. State government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed or create additional pressure on how our products are priced. Many states have discussed and debated and are considering new pricing legislation, including state proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information, limit price increases or to place a maximum price ceiling, or cap, on pharmaceutical products. For example, Ohio voters are expected to consider in their November 2017 election a ballot proposition that would prohibit the state from paying a greater price for drugs than the lowest price paid by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Passage of this proposition could lead to the introduction of additional ballot initiatives in other states. While we are unable to predict if these or other changes may ultimately be enacted, to the extent that future changes affect how our products are paid for and reimbursed by government and private payers in the United States our business could be adversely impacted. Changes in U.S. federal reimbursement policy may also arise as a result of regulations or demonstration projects implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare, Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces. CMS has substantial power to quickly implement policy changes that can significantly affect how our products are covered and reimbursed. Further, CMS is undertaking other projects to test care models, such as the CMS Oncology Care Model (OCM) that provides participating physician practices with performance-based financial incentives that aim to manage or reduce Medicare costs while improving efficacy of care. We believe the OCM has impacted utilization of certain of our oncology products by participating physician practices and may continue to do so in the future. In addition, the timing of reimbursement policy decisions can affect our business. Legislative or regulatory changes in the United States or other federal or state government initiatives that decrease the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates, limit our ability to offer co-pay payment assistance to commercial patients, limit the pricing of pharmaceutical products or reduce the use of our U.S. products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Payers, including healthcare insurers, Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage. Consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantly increasing such discounts and rebates and limiting patient access and usage. Three PBMs currently oversee approximately 75% of total covered lives in the United States. Payers continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients, and some payers may attempt to limit the use of programs assisting commercial patients with their co-payments. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to our products, such as by requiring prior authorizations or step therapy, and may choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely. For example, since the launch of Repatha® in August 2015, 33the application of utilization management criteria by some payers, including PBMs, has resulted in denials of coverage for a significant number of patients for whom Repatha® has been prescribed, slowing Repatha® sales. In March 2017, we presented data from our phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha® to prevent cardiovascular events, which met its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant developments. However, in the current competitive environment, the application of restrictive utilization management criteria by some payers may continue until the clinical data is reflected in approved product labeling, or even thereafter. Ultimately, further discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products.We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products to U.S. government healthcare programs. Pricing data that we submit impacts the payment rates for providers, rebates we pay, and discounts we are required to provide under Medicare, Medicaid and other government drug programs. Government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. Our price reporting data calculations are reviewed monthly and quarterly, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions and/or underlying data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.Outside the United States, we expect countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce their healthcare expenditures. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Part I, Item 1. Business—Reimbursement. For example, international reference pricing (IRP) is widely used by a large number of countries to control costs based on an external benchmark of a product’s price in other countries. IRP policies can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. Any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our products or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or could otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax. Our tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business, and a number of audits are currently underway. Tax authorities are becoming more aggressive in their audits and are particularly focused on the allocations of income and expense among tax jurisdictions. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. The significant proposed adjustments relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and allocate additional profits to the United States. On April 12, 2017, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012 that included the proposed adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and plan to initiate the administrative appeals process, which will likely not be concluded within the next 12 months. Final resolution of the IRS audit could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows if not resolved favorably. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. President Trump has indicated that U.S. corporate tax reform is a high priority for his Administration, and he, as well as the U.S. Congress, have proposed sweeping changes to the U.S. tax system including changes to corporate tax rates and the taxation of income earned outside the United States (including the taxation of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings). A change to the U.S. tax system, a change to the tax system in a jurisdiction where we have significant operations, such as the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, or a change in tax law in other jurisdictions where we do business, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and on the results of our operations.34Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSDuring the three months ended March 31, 2017, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program and the repurchase activity was as follows: Total numberof sharespurchased Averageprice paidper share Total number ofshares purchasedas part of publicly announced program Maximum dollarvalue that mayyet be purchasedunder the program(1)January 1 - 311,556,065 $154.43 1,556,065 $3,835,384,785February 1 - 28856,815 $167.73 856,815 $3,691,674,095March 1 - 311,002,997 $170.62 1,002,997 $3,520,538,054 3,415,877 $162.52 3,415,877  (1)In October 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase that resulted in a total of $5.0 billion available under the stock repurchase program.Item 6.
