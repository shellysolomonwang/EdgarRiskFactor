Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II herein. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, EPS, liquidity and capital resources, trends and planned dividends, stock repurchases and restructuring plans. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.OverviewThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2014, and June 30, 2014. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with GAAP.Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its biologics manufacturing expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people’s lives. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be the world’s largest independent biotechnology company, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.Currently, we market primarily recombinant protein therapeutics for supportive cancer care, inflammation, nephrology and bone disease. Our principal products are Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), NEUPOGEN® (filgrastim), Enbrel® (etanercept), XGEVA® (denosumab), Prolia® (denosumab), Sensipar®/Mimpara® (cinacalcet) and our erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa) and EPOGEN® (epoetin alfa). Our product sales outside the United States consist principally of sales in Europe. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, our principal products represented 92% of worldwide product sales. We market several other products, including Vectibix® (panitumumab), Nplate® (romiplostim) and, through our wholly owned subsidiary Onyx, Kyprolis® (carfilzomib).25Significant developmentsFollowing is a summary of selected significant developments affecting our business that have occurred since June 30, 2014. For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2014, and June 30, 2014.Products/Pipeline Evolocumab•In August 2014, we announced that the phase 3 YUKAWA-2 (StudY of LDL-Cholesterol Reduction Using a Monoclonal PCSK9 Antibody in Japanese Patients With Advanced Cardiovascular Risk) study evaluating evolocumab in combination with statin therapy in Japanese patients with high cardiovascular risk and high cholesterol met its co-primary endpoints.•In August 2014, we announced that we submitted a BLA to the FDA for the treatment of high cholesterol.•In September 2014, we announced that we submitted an MAA to the EMA for the treatment of high cholesterol.Ivabradine•In August 2014, we announced that the FDA granted priority review designation for the treatment of chronic heart failure.Kyprolis® •In August 2014, we and our subsidiary Onyx announced that the phase 3 clinical trial FOCUS (CarFilzOmib for AdvanCed Refractory MUltiple Myeloma European Study) did not meet its primary endpoint of improving overall survival.AMG 416 •In August 2014, we announced that a second placebo-controlled phase 3 study evaluating AMG 416 for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease, receiving hemodialysis, met its primary and all secondary endpoints.Talimogene laherparepvec•In September 2014, we announced that we submitted an MAA to the EMA for the treatment of adults with regionally and distantly metastatic melanoma.Blinatumomab•In October 2014, we announced that the FDA has accepted for review our BLA and granted priority review designation for the investigational bispecific T cell engager (BiTE®) antibody blinatumomab, for adults with Philadelphia-negative (Ph-) relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL, a rapidly progressing cancer of the blood and bone marrow.We also submitted an MAA to the EMA for the treatment of adults with Ph- relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL.Biosimilars•In October 2014, we announced that the phase 3 study evaluating efficacy and safety of biosimilar candidate ABP 501 compared with Humira® (adalimumab) in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis met its primary endpoint.26Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2014 2013 Change 2014 2013 ChangeProduct sales:           U.S.$3,682 $3,625 2 % $10,729 $10,358 4 %Rest of the world (ROW)1,166 1,022 14 % 3,424 3,035 13 %Total product sales4,848 4,647 4 % 14,153 13,393 6 %Other revenues183 101 81 % 579 272 *Total revenues$5,031 $4,748 6 % $14,732 $13,665 8 %Operating expenses$3,565 $3,060 17 % $10,000 $8,985 11 %Operating income$1,466 $1,688 (13)% $4,732 $4,680 1 %Net income$1,244 $1,368 (9)% $3,864 $4,060 (5)%Diluted EPS$1.61 $1.79 (10)% $5.02 $5.31 (5)%Diluted shares771 766 1 % 769 764 1 %* Change in excess of 100%The increases in global product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, were driven by the addition of Kyprolis® as a result of the Onyx acquisition on October 1, 2013, and by Prolia®, XGEVA® and Neulasta®. Product sales in the third quarter of 2013 included a $155-million order for NEUPOGEN® from the U.S. government.The increases in other revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, were due primarily to our Nexavar® collaboration revenues and Stivarga® royalties as a result of the Onyx acquisition.The increases in operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, were driven primarily by Cost of sales as a result of acquisition-related expenses, including amortization of the acquired developed product technology rights. The three months ended September 30, 2014, was also impacted by Other operating expenses as a result of the restructuring plan announced earlier in the quarter.The decreases in net income and diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, were driven by the increases in operating expenses.Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2014 2013 Change  2014 2013 Change Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®$1,493 $1,601 (7)% $4,301 $4,383 (2)%ENBREL1,120 1,155 (3)% 3,351 3,351 — %EPOGEN®518 491 5 % 1,492 1,428 4 %Aranesp®474 449 6 % 1,451 1,441 1 %XGEVA® 318 261 22 % 896 733 22 %Prolia® 255 178 43 % 715 508 41 %Sensipar®/Mimpara®273 259 5 % 841 782 8 %Other products397 253 57 % 1,106 767 44 %Total product sales$4,848 $4,647 4 % $14,153 $13,393 6 %Future sales of our products are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others.

We now face competition in the United States, which may have a material adverse impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN® and, to a lesser extent, Neulasta®. In addition, in July 2014, Sandoz Inc. announced that the FDA has accepted its filing for a biosimilar version of filgrastim under the new biosimilar regulatory pathway. Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) expires in October 2015.The increase in global Neulasta® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2014, was driven mainly by an increase in the average net sales price in the United States. The increase in global Neulasta® sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, was driven mainly by an increase in the average net sales price in the United States, offset partially by a unit decline in the United States.The decreases in global NEUPOGEN® sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, were driven by a $155-million order from the U.S. government in the third quarter of 2013. Excluding the impact of this order, sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, reflected decreases in unit demand in the United States, offset mostly by the increased sales as a result of reacquiring rights to filgrastim in certain regions.We believe Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® underlying demand was slightly impacted by short- and long-acting competition in the United States and Europe, respectively. ROW included sales in new markets as a result of reacquiring rights to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective January 1, 2014.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2014 2013 Change  2014 2013 Change ENBREL — U.S.$1,048 $1,073 (2)% $3,143 $3,136 — %ENBREL — Canada72 82 (12)% 208 215 (3)%Total ENBREL$1,120 $1,155 (3)% $3,351 $3,351 — %The decrease in ENBREL sales for the three months ended September 30, 2014, was driven primarily by unfavorable changes in wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories, offset partially by unit demand growth.ENBREL sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, were flat, as an increase in the average net sales price was offset primarily by unfavorable changes in wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories.28EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2014 2013 Change  2014 2013 Change EPOGEN® — U.S.$518 $491 5% $1,492 $1,428 4%The increases in EPOGEN® sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, were driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price. Unit demand continues to be relatively stable.Our remaining material U.S. patent for EPOGEN® expires in May 2015. As a result, we may face competition in the United States, which may have a material adverse impact over time on EPOGEN® sales. In addition, EPOGEN® and Aranesp® will face competition from the launch of MIRCERA® in the United States. Pursuant to a December 2009 settlement agreement between Amgen and Roche, Roche is now allowed to begin selling MIRCERA® in the United States under terms of a limited-license agreement. Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2014 2013 Change  2014 2013 Change Aranesp® — U.S.$188 $171 10% $588 $567 4 %Aranesp® — ROW286 278 3% 863 874 (1)%Total Aranesp®$474 $449 6% $1,451 $1,441 1 %The increase in global Aranesp® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2014, was driven largely by unit demand in international markets.XGEVA® and Prolia®  Total XGEVA® and total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2014 2013 Change  2014 2013 Change XGEVA® — U.S.$225 $194 16% $632 $561 13%XGEVA® — ROW93 67 39% 264 172 53%Total XGEVA®318 261 22% 896 733 22%Prolia® — U.S.150 109 38% 428 314 36%Prolia® — ROW105 69 52% 287 194 48%Total Prolia®255 178 43% 715 508 41%Total XGEVA®/Prolia®$573 $439 31% $1,611 $1,241 30%The increases in global XGEVA® sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, were driven by increases in unit demand.

After evaluating additional efficiency initiatives, particularly in the area of shared services, outsourcing and other external expense categories, we now plan to reduce staff by 3,500 to 4,000 by the end of 2015. Our headquarters will remain in Thousand Oaks, California, with a reduced number of staff consolidated into fewer of the existing buildings, and we will close our facilities in the states of Washington and Colorado. Company-wide, these actions will result in an approximate 23% reduction in our facilities footprint. These actions will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $935 million to $1,035 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2014, we initiated the above-noted actions and incurred $376 million of restructuring costs. We expect that substantially all remaining restructuring actions and related estimated costs to be incurred will occur during the fourth quarter of 2014 and in 2015.See Note 2, Restructuring, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Cost of salesCost of sales increased to 22.0% and 22.9% of product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively, driven by acquisition-related expenses that included $199 million and $621 million, respectively, of non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Onyx acquisition. The nine months ended September 30, 2014, also included a $99-million charge related to the termination of the supply contract with Roche as a result of acquiring the licenses to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective January 1, 2014. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, Cost of sales would have been 20.2% and 20.9% of product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared with 15.0% and 15.4% of product sales for the corresponding periods of the prior year. See Note 4, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe increase in R&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2014, was driven primarily by increased costs of $95 million associated with Onyx across all categories of R&D spend, offset partially by the $50 million upfront payment to Servier for the U.S. rights to ivabradine in the three months ended September 30, 2013. Overall, costs associated with later stage clinical program support increased $71 million, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $28 million and Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities of $14 million.The increase in R&D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, was driven primarily by increased costs of $339 million associated with Onyx across all categories of R&D spend, as well as increased costs associated with other later stage clinical program support. Overall, costs associated with later stage clinical program support increased $335 million, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $74 million and Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities of $32 million.Selling, general and administrativeThe decreases in SG&A expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, were driven primarily by the expiration of the ENBREL profit share in October 2013, which reduced expenses by $261 million and $723 million, respectively. These declines were offset partially by the addition of $53 million and $171 million, respectively, as a result of the Onyx acquisition and the BPD fee accrual of an additional $145 million as the final regulations accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year. See Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the BPD fee.OtherOther operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, included certain charges related to our restructuring and other cost savings initiatives, primarily severance, of $330 million and $368 million, respectively. Those charges were offset partially by decreases to the estimated aggregate fair value of the contingent consideration obligations of $62 million and $47 million, respectively.Other operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, included certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives, primarily severance, of $35 million and $46 million, respectively. The nine months ended September 30, 2013, also included increases to the estimated aggregate fair value of the contingent consideration obligations related to talimogene laherparepvec of $111 million.31Non-operating expenses/income and income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013Interest expense, net$269 $257 $810 $761Interest and other income, net$140 $72 $377 $332Provision for income taxes$93 $135 $435 $191Effective tax rate7.0% 9.0% 10.1% 4.5%Interest expense, netThe increase in interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2014, was due to a higher average outstanding debt balance in the current year offset partially by financing fees paid in connection with the acquisition of Onyx in the prior year period. The increase in interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was due to a higher average outstanding debt balance in the current year period and the recognition of expenses in connection with the repayment of the Master Repurchase Agreement in May 2014, offset partially by financing fees paid in connection with the acquisition of Onyx in the prior year period.Interest and other income, netThe increases in interest and other income, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, was due primarily to higher interest income as a result of higher average cash balances and higher net gains on investments recognized in the current year periods. Income taxesOur effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, were 7.0% and 10.1%, respectively, compared with 9.0% and 4.5% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2014, is due primarily to the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses, including higher domestic acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs. The increase was offset partially by the exclusion of the benefit of the R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2013, and was not reinstated as of September 30, 2014.The increase in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, is due primarily to two significant events that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2013. First, we settled our federal income tax examination for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009 in which we agreed to certain adjustments and remeasured our UTBs accordingly, resulting in a net tax benefit of approximately $185 million. Second, our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2013, included a benefit of approximately $60 million for the full-year 2012 federal R&D tax credit, recorded as a discrete item in the first quarter of 2013. In addition, our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, does not include a benefit for the federal R&D tax credit. The increase was offset partially by the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses due primarily to higher domestic acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2014.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, would have been 12.5% and 15.0%, respectively, compared with 13.8% and 9.8% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.See Note 4, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.32Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): September 30, 2014 December 31, 2013Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$28,075 $19,401Restricted investments— 3,412 Total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investments$28,075 $22,813Total assets$70,775 $66,125Current portion of long-term debt$2,500 $2,505Long-term debt$30,480 $29,623Stockholders’ equity$25,325 $22,096The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of factors. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors — There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or that we will repurchase stock. In each of December 2013, March 2014 and July 2014, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.61 per share of common stock, which were paid on March 7, June 6, and September 5, 2014, respectively. On October 17, 2014, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.61 per share of common stock which will be paid on December 5, 2014. We have not made repurchases under our Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program since the first quarter of 2013. As of September 30, 2014, $1.6 billion remained available under the program. In October 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an increase that resulted in a total of $4.0 billion available under the stock repurchase program. On October 28, 2014, we announced plans to reinitiate repurchasing activity under the program.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate, for the foreseeable future, to satisfy: our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we may strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to repurchase stock and pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Item 1A. Risk Factors — Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of September 30, 2014, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $298 million, of which $197 million was past due. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary.33Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaling $28.1 billion as of September 30, 2014, approximately $25.4 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan Credit Facility each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of September 30, 2014. On July 30, 2014, we entered into a revolving credit agreement for a total commitment of $2.5 billion, which amends and restates our revolving credit agreement dated December 2, 2011 (the 2011 Agreement). This amended and restated agreement extended the commitment term from the 2011 Agreement, but is otherwise on substantially similar terms to the 2011 Agreement. The commitments of each bank under this amended and restated agreement have an initial term of five years and may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Nine months ended September 30, 2014 2013Net cash provided by operating activities$6,110 $4,456Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities$(6,126) $1,649Net cash used in financing activities$(112) $(1,081)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2014, benefited from timing of receipts from customers, including the impact of $100 million received under a government-funded program in Spain, and lower payments to taxing authorities.InvestingCash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2014, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities and restricted investments of $5.3 billion, capital expenditures of $515 million, purchases of intangible assets of $150 million and cash paid for acquisitions of $115 million. Cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities and restricted investments of $2.2 billion offset partially by capital expenditures of $492 million. Capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Singapore, Ireland and Puerto Rico, as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2014 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $800 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2014, was due primarily to the repayment of long-term debt of $3.5 billion and the payment of dividends of $1.4 billion offset partially by the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.5 billion and proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with our equity award programs of $153 million.Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, was due primarily to the cash settlement of the $2.5 billion principal amount of the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes which matured/converted, the payment of dividends of $1.1 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $832 million, offset partially by the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $3.1 billion and proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with our equity award programs of $268 million. See Note 9, Financing arrangements, and Note 10, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.34Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2014.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, and is incorporated herein by reference. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2014, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsIn May 2014, we issued $4.5 billion aggregate principal amount of debt, comprised of fixed and floating rate notes, and we repaid $3.1 billion of floating rate debt. See Note 9, Financing arrangements, in the condensed consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2014, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $33.0 billion and a fair value of $35.3 billion. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at September 30, 2014, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.5 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts.In connection with the issuance of a portion of fixed rate debt issued in May 2014, we entered into $2.25 billion aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap contracts, which qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges. These derivative contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective notes. As of September 30, 2014, we had outstanding interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $6.65 billion. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at September 30, 2014, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $360 million on interest rate swap contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the ensuing 12 months.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2014.Management determined that, as of September 30, 2014, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.35PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2014, and Note 12, Contingencies and commitments, for the periods ended March 31, 2014, and June 30, 2014, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, provide additional disclosure and context for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.We may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs and not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from our recently announced restructuring plan.On July 29, 2014, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations to deliver on the Company’s strategy while also improving the Company’s cost structure. On October 28, 2014, we announced additional efficiency initiatives, particularly in the area of shared services, outsourcing and other external expense categories. As part of the restructuring plan, we plan to reduce staff and close or dispose of certain facilities. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits and savings from our restructuring efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.Following the completion of our restructuring, we must execute our core business initiatives with fewer human resources. We must also attract, retain and motivate key employees that are critical to our business. If we are unable to effectively execute with fewer staff members and/or attract, retain or motivate key employees, it may adversely affect our business.There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or that we will repurchase stock.Our Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends on our common stock since it adopted a dividend policy in 2011. In addition, in October 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our stock repurchase program that resulted in a total of $4.0 billion available under the repurchase program. Whether we pay such dividends and repurchase our stock in the future, and the amount and timing of such dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and agreements of the Company applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends and the repurchase of stock. Future dividends and stock repurchases, including their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions; debt service requirements; our credit rating; changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares. Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all. The reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.Item 6. EXHIBITS
