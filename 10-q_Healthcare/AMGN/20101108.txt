Overview  The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with GAAP.  We are the largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We concentrate on innovating novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We operate in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.  Currently, we market primarily recombinant protein therapeutic products for supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products currently include Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa), EPOGEN® (Epoetin alfa), Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim) and ENBREL (etanercept), all of which are sold in the United States. ENBREL is marketed under a co-promotion agreement with Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”) in the United States and Canada. Our international product sales consist principally of European sales of Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, our principal products represented 92% of worldwide product sales; for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, our principal products represented 93% of worldwide product sales.  During the three months ended June 30, 2010, we also began selling Prolia™ (denosumab). We are jointly commercializing Prolia™ with GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”) for postmenopausal osteoporosis (“PMO”) in Europe in accordance with a collaboration agreement entered into in July 2009. In addition, our other marketed products include: Sensipar®/Mimpara® (cinacalcet); Vectibix® (panitumumab); and Nplate® (romiplostim). For additional information about our products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see “Item 1. Business – Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates” in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and the discussion below with respect to Prolia™.  Key developments  The following is a list of selected key developments that occurred during 2010 affecting our business. For additional 2010 developments and a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010.  17    Table of Contents  Prolia™ Developments  On May 28, 2010, the European Commission (“EC”) granted marketing authorization for Prolia™ for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fractures and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures. The timing of reimbursement authority approval of pricing in individual European Union countries will vary by country, which could follow the EC approval by many months. For example, on July 1, 2010, Prolia™ received reimbursement authority in Germany, and on October 27, 2010, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom recommended Prolia™ for reimbursement as a treatment option for certain postmenopausal women who are at increased risk of primary and secondary osteoporotic fractures if other treatments available on the publicly-funded National Health Service are unsuitable.  On June 1, 2010, the FDA approved Prolia™ for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.  We estimate that the majority of potential U.S. Prolia™ patients are covered under Medicare and the remaining under commercial plans. Prolia™ is currently being reimbursed under Medicare Part B through a “buy and bill” process. The buy and bill reimbursement process for Prolia™ may require time to establish as it involves physicians purchasing Prolia™ with the intent to submit a claim to a payer for reimbursement after the injection has been administered. As of September 30, 2010, all 15 Medicare Administration Contractors have confirmed medical coverage for Prolia™ and have issued paid claims. Future U.S. product sales for Prolia™ will be in part dependent upon physicians’ willingness to use a buy and bill approach, in particular primary care physicians who most frequently administer Prolia™ to patients but are less accustomed to this reimbursement process. In addition, U.S. product sales for Prolia™ will be supported by Medicare Part D coverage, which we expect will be obtained in 2011, and by the expansion of commercial coverage.  Worldwide sales of Prolia™ for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 totaled approximately $10 million and $13 million, respectively.  Please refer to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2010 for additional details on the Prolia™ risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) program and the post-marketing surveillance program for PMO patients.  Other Denosumab Developments  On May 14, 2010, we submitted a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) to the FDA for denosumab for the reduction of skeletal related events (“SREs”) in cancer patients. On July 16, 2010, we announced that the FDA granted priority review designation to our denosumab BLA. Consistent with priority review guidelines, the FDA will target an Agency action within six months of the application submission date, resulting in a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date of November 18, 2010. We also submitted a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) on June 4, 2010 for denosumab for the reduction of SREs in cancer patients.  ESA Developments  On February 16, 2010, Amgen and Centocor Ortho Biotech Products, L.P., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (“J&J”), announced that the FDA approved a REMS for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (“ESAs”) which includes Aranesp®, EPOGEN® and Procrit® (Epoetin alfa). In order to ensure continued access to ESAs for healthcare providers who prescribe, or prescribe and dispense, ESAs to patients with cancer, healthcare providers and hospitals are required to train and enroll in the ESA APPRISE (Assisting Providers and cancer Patients with Risk Information for the Safe use of ESAs) Oncology Program by February 15, 2011. Enrolled prescribers are required to document that a discussion about the risks of ESAs took place with each patient prior to the initiation of each new course of ESA therapy. Direct patient registration or approval prior to ESA administration is not required through the ESA APPRISE Oncology Program.  On July 26, 2010, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) released the Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis, effective January 1, 2011. Under the final rule, end stage renal disease (“ESRD”) facilities were required to elect, by November 1, 2010, whether they would implement the rule in its entirety beginning in 2011 or ratably over a four-year period beginning in 2011. On November 2 and November 4, 2010, Fresenius Medical Care and DaVita Inc., the two largest dialysis organizations in the United States, separately announced that they intend to implement the final bundling rule in its entirety beginning in 2011 for all of their clinics. In preparation of implementing the final rule, ESRD facilities may transition their treatment protocols in the later part of 2010, which could also impact the dose/utilization of EPOGEN®.  On October 18, 2010, the FDA held a Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee (“CRDAC”) meeting to review results from the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp® Therapy (“TREAT”) study conducted in patients not on dialysis, and how those results inform the appropriate use of ESAs in patients with chronic kidney disease (“CKD”). Prior to the CRDAC meeting, we submitted proposed labeling changes to the FDA regarding the use of ESAs in chronic renal failure patients not on dialysis that would limit treatment to patients who are most likely to benefit, specifically those with significant anemia (<10 grams per deciliter (“g/dL”)), and who are at high risk for transfusion and for whom transfusion avoidance is considered clinically important, including those in whom it is important to preserve kidney transplant eligibility. In addition to  18    Table of Contents  narrowing the patient population, we are proposing a more conservative dosing algorithm in these patients. The Company will continue working with the FDA to develop information that will optimize the use of ESAs in CKD patients. In addition, on October 26, 2010, the CMS announced a January 19, 2011 meeting of the Medicare Evidence Development & Coverage Advisory Committee (“MEDCAC”) to further examine currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD.  Certain of these ESA developments could have material adverse impacts on our business and results of operations.  Please refer to our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010 for additional details on ESA developments.  U.S. Healthcare Reform  In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the companion Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law. We refer to these two laws collectively as the “new healthcare reform law.” The new healthcare reform law imposes additional costs on and reduces the revenues of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. The following table summarizes certain provisions of the new healthcare reform law and the adverse impacts of these provisions on our U.S. product sales to date.                                     Nine months ended                September 30, 2010    Healthcare Reform Provision   Effective Date   (in millions)                         • Medicaid base rebate rate payable on our products increased from 15.1% to 23.1% of the Average Manufacturer’s Price (“AMP”)   January 1, 2010     $ 46    • Public Health Service (“PHS”) (340B) program eligibility expanded               – Discounts comparable to the Medicaid rebate extended to entities receiving PHS grants and to hospitals serving a disproportionate number of Medicare and Medicaid patients    January 1, 2010       17    • Medicaid rebates applied to managed care organizations   March 23, 2010       70    • AMP Definition changed which may result in higher discounts for certain of our products   October 1, 2010       —    • Prescription Drug Manufacturers’ Annual Fee                  – Aggregate annual fee to be paid by manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs totaling $28 billion over 10 years, of which $2.5 billion is payable in 2011                  – Fee to be apportioned among participating companies based on each company’s sales of qualifying products. The fee is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes   January 1, 2011       —    • Part D mandatory discount (referred to as the “doughnut hole”)               – 50% discount to Medicare Part D patients whose prescription expenses exceed the Part D limit, but have not reached the catastrophic coverage threshold   January 1, 2011       —     • Medicaid coverage eligibility expanded from 100% to 133% of the federal poverty level   January 1, 2014       —                           Total     $ 133                         Total U.S. product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2010 were adversely impacted by $64 million by the new healthcare reform law provisions that were in effect during this period.  We anticipate that the impact of the above provisions for the full year 2010 will be slightly below $200 million and that the full year impact for 2011 will be approximately two to two-and-a-half times the amount currently estimated for 2010. Estimation of the aggregate financial impact resulting from the new healthcare reform law is highly complex and depends on a number of factors. Therefore, our estimates are subject to change.  The new healthcare reform law authorizes the FDA to approve biosimilar products. With the resulting likely introduction of biosimilars in the United States, we may face greater competition from biosimilar products,  19    Table of Contents  including from biosimilar manufacturers with approved products in Europe that may seek to quickly obtain U.S. approval now that biosimilar legislation has been enacted, subject to our ability to enforce our patents.  Please refer to our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010 for additional details on the new healthcare reform law.  Vectibix® Developments  On April 16, 2010, our application for marketing authorization for the use of Vectibix® in first- and second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (“mCRC”) in patients whose tumors contain wild type KRAS genes was submitted to the EMA. We filed supplemental BLA submissions for first- and second-line mCRC with the FDA on October 29 and November 4, 2010.  On August 11, 2010, we announced top-line results from a 658-patient randomized phase 3 trial evaluating Vectibix® as a first-line treatment in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer. The data showed the addition of Vectibix® to platinum-based chemotherapy did not result in a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, the primary endpoint, compared to chemotherapy alone [median 11.1 months versus 9.0 months, hazard ratio (“HR”) 0.87 (95% confidence interval (“CI”): 0.73, 1.05)]. Therefore, the study did not meet its primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints of progression-free survival (“PFS”) [median 5.8 months versus 4.6 months, HR 0.78 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.92)] and objective response rate (36% versus 25%) were numerically improved but were not tested for statistical significance. The secondary endpoints included PFS, objective response rate, duration of response, time to progression, time to response, patient reported outcomes and safety. The most frequently reported adverse events in the Vectibix® plus chemotherapy arm included nausea, rash, neutropenia and vomiting, as anticipated, for this combination therapy.  Puerto Rico Tax Legislation  On October 25, 2010, the government of Puerto Rico passed legislation that established a new tax on the sale of products manufactured in Puerto Rico, effective January 1, 2011. We are currently evaluating the new legislation and its potential impact on Amgen.  20    Table of Contents  Selected Financial Data  The following table presents selected financial data (amounts in millions, except percentages and per share data):                                                               Three months ended September 30,   Nine months ended September 30,        2010     2009     Change   2010     2009     Change     Product sales:                                                  U.S.   $ 2,921     $ 2,918       —     $ 8,385     $ 8,253       2  %   International     838       818       2  %     2,515       2,355       7  %                                              Total product sales     3,759       3,736       1  %     10,900       10,608       3  %                                                      Other revenues     57       76       (25 )%     312       225       39  %                                              Total revenues   $ 3,816     $ 3,812       —     $ 11,212     $ 10,833       3  %                                                                                                 Operating expenses   $ 2,337     $ 2,207       6  %   $ 6,735     $ 6,450       4  %                                                      Operating income   $ 1,479     $ 1,605       (8 )%   $ 4,477     $ 4,383       2  %                                                      Net income   $ 1,236     $ 1,386       (11 )%   $ 3,605     $ 3,674       (2 )%                                                      Diluted EPS   $ 1.28     $ 1.36       (6 )%   $ 3.71     $ 3.58       4  %                                                      Diluted shares     962       1,022       (6 )%     971       1,025       (5 )%     The following discusses certain key changes in our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 as well as our financial condition as of September 30, 2010.  The increase in total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to increases in worldwide product sales, discussed below, and, to a lesser extent, other revenues resulting from certain milestone payments earned in 2010.  U.S. product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2010 were largely unchanged as the decline in Aranesp® sales was substantially offset by an increase in Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales. The increase in U.S. product sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to favorable changes in wholesaler inventories.  Excluding a $16 million unfavorable and a $34 million favorable foreign exchange impact, international product sales increased 4% and 5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, respectively, primarily due to increases in demand for Sensipar®, Vectibix®, Nplate® and Prolia™.  The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily driven by lower research and development (“R&D”) costs principally due to higher cost recoveries in 2009. The increase in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to increased selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses in part due to increased spending activities for Prolia™.  The decrease in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to lower operating income and a higher effective income tax rate as a result of favorable tax settlements in 2009. The decrease in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to a higher effective income tax rate as a result of favorable tax settlements in 2009, partially offset by higher operating income.  The decrease in diluted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2010 was due to the reduction in net income, partially offset by a reduction in the number of shares used in the calculation of diluted EPS. The increase in diluted EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was due to the reduction in the number of shares used in the calculation of diluted EPS, partially offset by the reduction in net income. The decreases in the number of shares used in the computations of diluted EPS reflect the impact of our stock repurchase program, including approximately 6.6 million and 46 million shares that were repurchased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 at total costs of $364 million and $2.7 billion, respectively.  As of September 30, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $17.0 billion and total debt outstanding was $13.3 billion, including $2.5 billion which is due in February 2011. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and  21    Table of Contents  marketable securities balances as of September 30, 2010, approximately $14.0 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for permanent use in our foreign operations. If these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates.  Product sales  Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                                               Three months ended September 30,   Nine months ended September 30,        2010     2009     Change   2010     2009     Change     Aranesp®   $ 623     $ 685       (9 )%   $ 1,853     $ 2,004       (8 )%   EPOGEN®     653       663       (2 )%     1,933       1,866       4  %   Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®     1,254       1,210       4  %     3,607       3,441       5  %   ENBREL     914       924       (1 )%     2,595       2,581       1  %   Sensipar®     175       165       6  %     526       480       10  %   Vectibix®     70       58       21  %     209       167       25  %   Nplate®     60       31       94  %     164       69       —    Prolia™     10       —       —       13       —       —                                               Total product sales   $ 3,759     $ 3,736       1  %   $ 10,900     $ 10,608       3  %                                                Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain products more significantly than others. For a list of certain of these factors, see “Results of Operations – Product Sales” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2010.  Aranesp®  Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                                               Three months ended September 30,   Nine months ended September 30,        2010     2009     Change   2010     2009     Change     Aranesp® — U.S.   $ 283     $ 333       (15 )%   $ 818     $ 963       (15 )%   Aranesp® — International     340       352       (3 )%     1,035       1,041       (1 )%                                              Total Aranesp®   $ 623     $ 685       (9 )%   $ 1,853     $ 2,004       (8 )%                                                The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to a low double-digit percentage point decline in unit demand, reflecting an overall decline in the segment, slightly offset by an increase in the average net sales price, and unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventories. The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to a decline in unit demand, reflecting an overall decline in the segment.  Excluding a $7 million unfavorable and a $12 million favorable foreign exchange impact, international Aranesp® sales decreased 1% and 2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, respectively, primarily due to decreases in demand, reflecting overall declines in the segment.  Future Aranesp® sales will depend, in part, on the factors as set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2010 and such factors as:  • Regulatory developments, including those resulting from:  – The October 18, 2010 CRDAC meeting;  – The proposed ESA product label changes we submitted to the FDA prior to the CRDAC meeting; and  • Reimbursement developments resulting from the January 19, 2011 MEDCAC meeting.  Certain of these factors could have material adverse impacts on future sales of Aranesp®.  22    Table of Contents  EPOGEN®  Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                                               Three months ended September 30,   Nine months ended September 30,        2010     2009     Change   2010     2009     Change     EPOGEN® — U.S.   $ 653     $ 663       (2 )%   $ 1,933     $ 1,866       4  %     The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to low single-digit percentage point declines in both unit demand and the average net sales price, partially offset by favorable changes in wholesaler inventories. The decrease in unit demand reflects a decrease in dose utilization, partially offset by patient population growth. The increase in EPOGEN® sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to an increase in unit demand and favorable changes in wholesaler inventories. The increase in unit demand was due to patient population growth, partially offset by a decline in dose utilization.  Future EPOGEN® sales will depend, in part, on the factors as set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2010 and such factors as:  • Reimbursement developments, including those resulting from:  – The CMS’s Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis;  – The January 19, 2011 MEDCAC meeting;  • Regulatory developments, including those resulting from:  – The October 18, 2010 CRDAC meeting; and  – The proposed ESA product label changes we submitted to the FDA prior to the CRDAC meeting.  Certain of these factors could have material adverse impacts on future sales of EPOGEN®.  Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®  Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                                               Three months ended September 30,   Nine months ended September 30,        2010     2009     Change   2010     2009     Change     Neulasta® — U.S.   $ 692     $ 657       5  %   $ 1,972     $ 1,876       5  %   NEUPOGEN® — U.S.     250       240       4  %     700       672       4  %                                              U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total     942       897       5  %     2,672       2,548       5  %                                              Neulasta® — International     224       214       5  %     668       603       11  %   NEUPOGEN® — International     88       99       (11 )%     267       290       (8 )%                                              International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total     312       313       —       935       893       5  %                                              Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®   $ 1,254     $ 1,210       4  %   $ 3,607     $ 3,441       5  %                                                The increases in U.S. sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 were primarily due to increases in the average net sales price and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, favorable changes in wholesaler inventories.  Excluding a $6 million unfavorable and a $15 million favorable foreign exchange impact, international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales increased 2% and 3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, respectively, primarily due to increases in demand, reflecting the continued conversion from NEUPOGEN® to Neulasta®.  Future Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales will depend, in part, on the factors as set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2010. 23    Table of Contents  ENBREL  Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                                               Three months ended September 30,   Nine months ended September 30,        2010     2009     Change   2010     2009     Change     ENBREL — U.S.   $ 856     $ 872       (2 )%   $ 2,429     $ 2,430       —    ENBREL — Canada     58       52       12  %     166       151       10  %                                              Total ENBREL   $ 914     $ 924       (1 )%   $ 2,595     $ 2,581       1  %                                                The decline in ENBREL sales for the three months ended September 30, 2010 was due to share declines, primarily in dermatology, partially offset by a slight increase in the average net sales price. The increase in ENBREL sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to favorable changes in wholesaler inventories, as the share declines, primarily in dermatology, were substantially offset by a low single-digit percentage point increase in the average net sales price. ENBREL continues to maintain a leading position in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments.  Future ENBREL sales will depend, in part, on the factors as set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2010.

Research and development  The increase in R&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2010 was principally attributable to $40 million of higher expense recoveries in 2009 associated with ongoing collaborations and higher staff-related costs of $23 million, primarily from increased headcount outside the United States.  The increase in R&D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily driven by $101 million of higher expense recoveries in 2009 associated with ongoing collaborations and higher staff-related costs of $72 million, partially offset by lower denosumab SRE clinical trial costs of $64 million and a prior year payment of $50 million to obtain an exclusive license to Cytokinetics Incorporated’s cardiac contractility program.  Selling, general and administrative  The increase in SG&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to higher costs of $37 million for staff and promotional activities for Prolia™ and other marketed products and higher litigation expenses of $16 million.  The increase in SG&A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to higher costs of $126 million for promotional activities for Prolia™ and other marketed products, higher litigation expenses of $49 million, higher staff-related costs of $36 million and higher expenses associated with the Pfizer profit share of $10 million, partially offset by charges of $23 million in 2009 for certain cost savings initiatives related to our 2007 restructuring plan and by expense recoveries of $21 million related to our GSK collaboration for Prolia™.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, excluding expenses associated with the Pfizer profit share of $302 million and $865 million, respectively, and $306 million and $855 million, respectively, SG&A expenses increased 5% and 10%, respectively.  25    Table of Contents  Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes  The following table presents non-operating expenses/income and the provisions for income taxes (dollar amounts in millions):                                             Three months ended September 30,     Nine months ended September 30,        2010     2009     2010     2009      Interest expense, net   $ 150     $ 139     $ 442     $ 436    Interest and other income, net   $ 105     $ 74     $ 283     $ 182    Provisions for income taxes   $ 198     $ 154     $ 713     $ 455    Effective tax rate     13.8  %     10.0  %     16.5  %     11.0  %     Interest expense, net  Included in interest expense, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 is the impact of non-cash interest expense of $67 million and $198 million, respectively, and of $63 million and $186 million, respectively, resulting from the change in the accounting for our convertible debt effective January 1, 2009.  Interest and other income, net  The increases in interest and other income, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 were primarily due to higher net realized gains on investments of $14 million and $57 million, respectively, and higher interest income of $13 million and $39 million, respectively, primarily due to higher average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.  Income taxes  The increases in our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 were primarily due to: (i) the favorable resolution of certain prior years’ non-routine transfer pricing matters with tax authorities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 compared to September 30, 2010; (ii) the exclusion of the benefit of the federal research and experimentation (“R&E”) tax credit in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 (the federal R&E credit expired as of December 31, 2009 and was not reinstated as of September 30, 2010); and (iii) a benefit in the three months ended March 31, 2009 relating to adjustments to previously established deferred taxes due to changes in California tax law effective for future periods.  See Note 2, “Income taxes” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  26    Table of Contents  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources  The following table summarizes selected financial data (in millions):                             September 30,     December 31,        2010     2009      Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities   $ 17,049     $ 13,442    Total assets     43,534       39,629    Current debt     2,451       —    Non-current debt     10,841       10,601    Stockholders’ equity     24,071       22,667      We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, including the repayment of our 2011 Convertible Notes with a principal balance of $2.5 billion in February 2011. In addition, we plan to opportunistically pursue our stock repurchase program and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sale of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other debt markets and equity markets.  Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of September 30, 2010. None of our financing arrangements contain any financial covenants.  Cash flows  The following table summarizes our cash flow activity (in millions):                             Nine months ended September 30,        2010     2009      Net cash provided by operating activities   $ 3,779     $ 4,513    Net cash used in investing activities     (3,661 )     (2,863 )   Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities     (51 )     153      Operating  Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 decreased primarily due to the timing and amounts of payments to taxing authorities.  Investing  During the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, cash used in investing activities was primarily for net purchases of $3.2 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, of marketable securities. Capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 totaled $398 million and $386 million, respectively. Capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 were primarily associated with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and other site developments. We currently estimate 2010 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $600 million.  Financing  In March 2010, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2040 (the “2040 Notes”) and $300 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2020 (the “March 2020 Notes”) in a registered offering. In September 2010, we issued $900 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2020 (the “October 2020 Notes”) and $600 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2041 (the “2041 Notes”) in a registered offering. The 2040 Notes, March 2020 Notes, October 2020 Notes and 2041 Notes pay interest at fixed annual rates of 5.75%, 4.50%, 3.45% and 4.95%, respectively. The notes may be redeemed at any time at our option, in whole or in part, at amounts equal to the outstanding principal amounts of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest and “make-whole” amounts, as defined. Upon the occurrence of a change in control triggering event, as defined, we may be required to purchase all or a portion of the notes at prices equal to 101% of the principal amounts of the notes plus accrued interest.  27    Table of Contents  See Note 6, “Financing arrangements” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our long-term borrowings.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we repurchased 46 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $2.7 billion ($2.6 billion of which represents a net cash outflow in the period). During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we repurchased 37.5 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $2.0 billion. As of September 30, 2010, we had $3.3 billion available for stock repurchases as authorized by our Board of Directors. Repurchases under our stock repurchase program reflects, in part, our confidence in the long-term value of our common stock. Additionally, we believe that it is an effective way of returning cash to our stockholders. The manner of purchases, amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a number of factors including the stock price, blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares and our credit rating and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions.  We receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options and from proceeds from the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase program. Our equity award programs provided $62 million and $146 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based on, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise prices of such options.  28    Table of Contents             Item 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2010.  Management determined that, as of September 30, 2010, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  29    Table of Contents     PART II — OTHER INFORMATION             Item 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    See Note 10, “Contingencies and commitments” to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, 2010, June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010 for discussions which are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. These discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 20, “Contingencies and commitments” to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.             Item 1A.   RISK FACTORS    This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described the primary risks relating to our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and periodically update those risks for material developments. These risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, operations, liquidity and stock price materially and adversely.  Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010, provide additional disclosure and context for these supplemental risks for the third quarter 2010 and are incorporated herein by reference.  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.  In October 2010, we initiated a voluntary recall of certain lots of ENBREL due to identification of cracks in a small number of the glass syringes which may have resulted in product leakage and syringe breakage. Further, beginning in September 2010, we initiated a voluntary recall of certain lots of EPOGEN® and J&J voluntarily recalled certain lots of PROCRIT®, manufactured by us, because a small number of vials in each lot were found to contain glass lamellae (extremely thin, barely visible glass flakes) which we believed was a result of the interaction of the formulation with glass vials during the shelf life of the product. Both actions were executed in close collaboration with the FDA. We may experience the same or other problems in the future, with respect to EPOGEN® or other of our products, resulting in broader product recalls, adverse event trends, delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products, which may adversely affect the sales of our products.  Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.  On October 26, 2010, the CMS announced a MEDCAC meeting for January 19, 2011 to examine evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD. On October 18, 2010 the FDA’s CRDAC discussed the results from the TREAT study conducted in patients not on dialysis, and how those results informed the appropriate use of ESAs in patients with CKD. Prior to the CRDAC meeting, we submitted proposed labeling changes to the FDA regarding the use of ESAs in chronic renal failure patients not on dialysis that would limit treatment to patients who are most likely to benefit, specifically those with significant anemia (<10 g/dL), and who are at high risk for transfusion and for whom transfusion avoidance is considered clinically important, including those in whom it is important to preserve kidney transplant eligibility. In addition to narrowing the patient population, we are proposing a more conservative dosing algorithm in these patients. We will continue to work with the FDA to develop information that will optimize the use of ESAs in CKD patients. Although we cannot predict what impact all of these activities could have on our business, the revised ESA labeling or any future labeling changes, including any required in connection with the CRDAC meeting, our ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding the conversion of the format of our ESA U.S. labels in accordance with the Physician’s Labeling Rule or other changes required by the FDA, the outcome from the NCA or MEDCAC meeting, the impact of the approved REMS for ESAs could have a material adverse impact on the coverage, reimbursement and sales of our ESAs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.  We rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In the event that any of these vendors has unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of its work, our ability to evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. As a result, this could adversely affect our ability to file for or gain regulatory approvals worldwide on a timely basis.  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.  30    Table of Contents  We are required to pay Medicaid rebates on products reimbursed by Medicaid at a rate of 23.1% of the AMP of a product, or if it is greater, the difference between the AMP and the best price available to any non-government customer. The definition of AMP recently changed and we expect the CMS to shortly issue a proposed rule further defining the new AMP definition. Until that rule is issued, we will be required to apply our judgment in certain aspects of the AMP calculation. Once the CMS rule is issued, we will have to determine whether our interpretation of AMP follows the rule or would need to be restated and this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  As referred to above, on October 26, 2010, the CMS announced a second MEDCAC meeting scheduled for January 19, 2011 to further examine currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD. This development initiates another phase in the process of reviewing and evaluating potential changes in Medicare coverage policies for the use of ESAs in these patients, although we cannot predict the outcome of this meeting.  Under the final rule to implement a bundled prospective payment system for ESRD, ESRD facilities were required to elect, by November 1, 2010, whether they will implement the rule in its entirety or ratably over a four-year period beginning in 2011. As a result, the implementation of the bundled payment system by ESRD facilities, either entirely or ratably beginning in 2011, could have a material adverse impact on the coverage and reimbursement, use and sales of EPOGEN® beginning in 2011, and Sensipar® beginning in 2014.  We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilar products which could impact our profitability.  The FDA held a public meeting on November 2-3, 2010 to seek stakeholder input on the subject and will accept written comments through 2010. The agency has the authority to approve biosimilar products but has not announced whether they will first publish guidance or rules for biosimilar applicants before approving biosimilar products. With the likely introduction of biosimilars in the United States, we may in the future face greater competition from biosimilar products and downward pressure on our product prices, sales and revenues, subject to our ability to enforce our patents.  We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.  We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of our products. Certain of these raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of these unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. We may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components if we discover previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components.  Quality issues which result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN® glass vials). We may experience or continue to experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products.  As noted above, these supplemental risks should be read in conjunction with those set forth in our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and the changes to these 10-K risk factors set forth in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010, which are incorporated herein by reference. Specifically, the risk factors entitled “Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval,” ”Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payer,” “Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations” and “We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilar products which could impact our profitability” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 were supplemented in Part II, Item 1A.

UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS    Repurchases under our stock repurchase program reflects, in part, our confidence in the long-term value of our common stock. Additionally, we believe that it is an effective way of returning cash to our stockholders. The manner of purchases, the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a number of factors including the stock price, blackout periods during which we are restricted from repurchasing shares, and our credit rating and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions.  A summary of our repurchase activity for the three months ended September 30, 2010 is as follows:                                                             Total number of     Maximum $ value        Total number     Average     shares purchased     that may yet be        of shares     price paid     as part of publicly     purchased under the        purchased     per share     announced programs     programs(1)      July 1 - July 31     —     $ —       —     $ 3,663,418,915    August 1 - August 31     —       —       —       3,663,418,915    September 1 - September 30     6,630,000       54.92       6,630,000       3,299,301,012                                         6,630,000       54.92       6,630,000                                                         (1)   In December 2009, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of our common stock. As of September 30, 2010, we had $3.3 billion available for stock repurchases as authorized by our Board of Directors.              Item 6.   EXHIBITS
