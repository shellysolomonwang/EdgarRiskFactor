Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in this footnote; in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017; and in Notes 14 and 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.Our legal proceedings involve various aspects of our business and a variety of claims, some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. In each of the matters described in this filing, in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, or in Notes 14 and 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively, plaintiffs seek an award of a not-yet-quantified amount of damages or an amount that is not material. In addition, a number of the matters pending against us are at very early stages of the legal process, which in complex proceedings of the sort we face often extend for several years. As a result, none of the matters pending against us described in this filing, in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, or in Notes 14 and 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively, have progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or the development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate a range of possible loss, if any, or such amounts are not material. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these matters, an adverse determination in one or more of these matters currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings and other matters are discussed below:Sensipar® (cinacalcet) LitigationSensipar® Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) Patent LitigationOn July 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the Delaware District Court) issued a trial order finding on the infringement claims and defenses in the Amgen Inc. v. Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. et al. consolidated lawsuit that Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. and Cadila Healthcare Ltd.

(collectively, Watson). On August 24, 2018, the Delaware District Court issued an order dismissing, without prejudice, the invalidity counterclaims of Amneal, Piramal, and Watson and entered judgment of non-infringement of the ’405 Patent in favor of Amneal, Piramal and Watson. On September 20, 2018, Amgen filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Federal Circuit Court). On October 9, 2018, the Delaware District Court dismissed, without prejudice, the invalidity counterclaims of Zydus and entered judgment of infringement of the ’405 Patent by Zydus in favor of Amgen, including an order that the effective date of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Zydus’s generic version of Sensipar® shall be no earlier than the expiry date of our ’405 Patent. On October 11, 2018, Zydus filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit Court and on October 24, 2018, the Federal Circuit Court consolidated the appeals of Zydus and Amgen.On September 7, 2018, Amgen filed a lawsuit in the Delaware District Court for infringement of the ’405 Patent against Emcure Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Heritage Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Heritage Pharma Labs Inc.As previously disclosed, Amgen filed lawsuits in the Delaware District Court and the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina (the North Carolina District Court) each against Accord Healthcare, Inc. (Accord) and Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Intas) for infringement of the ’405 Patent. On September 18, 2018, Accord responded to our lawsuit in the Delaware District Court by denying infringement of the ’405 Patent and alleging that the patent is invalid. On September 20, 2018, 27Intas was dismissed from the Delaware District Court lawsuit without prejudice by joint stipulation of the parties, and Amgen filed a notice voluntarily terminating the lawsuit filed in the North Carolina District Court. Sensipar® Pediatric Exclusivity LitigationOn October 2, 2018, by agreement between Amgen and the FDA, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed Amgen’s appeal of the final judgment that had been ordered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. NEUPOGEN® (filgrastim)/ Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) LitigationAdello NEUPOGEN® Patent LitigationOn October 3, 2018, Amgen filed an amended complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the New Jersey District Court) adding defendants Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC and Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to this patent infringement litigation and reducing the number of patents-in-suit from 17 to 4—specifically, U.S. Patent Nos. 8,940,878; 8,952,138; 9,643,997 (the ’997 Patent); and 9,856,287 (the ’287 Patent). On October 17, 2018, Adello Biologics, LLC (Adello) responded to the amended complaint, seeking judgment that our patents-in-suit are not infringed by Adello’s biosimilar filgrastim product and that our patents are invalid. Apotex NEUPOGEN®/Neulasta® Patent LitigationOn August 7, 2018, Amgen Inc. and Amgen Manufacturing, Ltd. (collectively, Amgen) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex) for infringement of the ’287 Patent in accordance with the patent provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act. This lawsuit stems from Apotex’s submissions of applications for FDA licensure of a pegfilgrastim product as biosimilar to Amgen’s Neulasta® and a filgrastim product as biosimilar to Amgen’s NEUPOGEN®. By its complaint, Amgen seeks, among other remedies, an injunction prohibiting Apotex from infringing the ’287 Patent. On October 1, 2018, Apotex and Adello filed a petition in the United States Patent and Trademark Office requesting that the Patent Trial and Appeal Board institute post grant review proceedings on the ’287 Patent.Pfizer NEUPOGEN® Patent LitigationOn August 9, 2018, defendant Pfizer answered Amgen’s complaint in this patent infringement litigation and included counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that Amgen’s ’997 Patent is not infringed by Pfizer’s biosimilar filgrastim product and that our patent is invalid. ENBREL (etanercept) LitigationSandoz ENBREL Patent LitigationOn September 10, 2018, the New Jersey District Court entered an order that the making, using, offering to sell or selling in the United States, or the importation into the United States by Sandoz Inc., Sandoz International GmbH, and Sandoz GmbH (collectively, Sandoz) of Sandoz’s biosimilar etanercept product infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 8,063,182 and 8,163,522. The New Jersey District Court held a bench trial from September 11, 2018 to September 25, 2018 focusing on Sandoz’s challenges to the validity of these patents. Closing arguments are scheduled for November 19, 2018.Hospira EPOGEN® (epoetin alfa) Patent LitigationFollowing a jury verdict finding our U.S. Patent No. 5,856,298 (the ’298 Patent) valid and infringed by Hospira Inc. (Hospira) and awarding Amgen $70 million in damages for such infringement, Hospira moved for judgment as a matter of law of noninfringement and invalidity of the ’298 Patent or, in the alternative, for reduction of the damage award or a new trial on the ’298 Patent. On August 27, 2018, the Delaware District Court denied Hospira’s motion and final judgment was entered on September 11, 2018. On October 3, 2018, Hospira filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit Court and on October 15, 2018, Amgen filed a cross-appeal. MVASI™ (bevacizumab-awwb) Patent LitigationOn August 31, 2018, plaintiffs Genentech and City of Hope reduced the number of asserted patents in this patent infringement litigation pending against Amgen from 26 to 8 in accordance with the scheduling order issued by the Delaware District Court. The jury trial has been rescheduled to begin on July 13, 2020.KANJINTI™ (trastuzumab) Patent LitigationOn August 23, 2018, plaintiffs Genentech and City of Hope moved to dismiss Amgen’s unenforceability counterclaims and affirmative defense in this patent infringement litigation pending against Amgen. 28Item 2.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with GAAP. Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics.

Our principal products—those with the most significant commercial sales—are ENBREL, Neulasta®, Prolia® (denosumab), Aranesp®, XGEVA® (denosumab), Sensipar®/Mimpara® and EPOGEN®. We also market a number of other products, including KYPROLIS®, Nplate®, Vectibix® (panitumumab), Repatha®, NEUPOGEN®, Parsabiv® (etelcalcetide), BLINCYTO® (blinatumomab), Aimovig®, IMLYGIC®, Corlanor® (ivabradine), KANJINTI™ and AMGEVITA™ (biosimilar adalimumab).Significant developments Following is a summary of selected significant developments affecting our business that have occurred since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2018. For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018.Products/Pipeline CardiovascularRepatha® (evolocumab)•In October 2018, we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes (NDCs) to make Repatha® available at the lower list price of $5,850 per year to address affordability for patients, particularly those on Medicare. 29InflammationTezepelumab•In September 2018, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tezepelumab in patients with severe asthma without an eosinophilic phenotype. Tezepelumab is being jointly developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca plc. Oncology/HematologyBLINCYTO® •In August 2018, we announced that the European Commission approved an expanded indication for BLINCYTO® as monotherapy for the treatment of pediatric patients aged one year or older with Philadelphia chromosome-negative CD19 positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is refractory or in relapse after receiving at least two prior therapies or in relapse after receiving prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.KYPROLIS®  •In October 2018, we announced that the FDA approved the supplemental New Drug Application to expand the Prescribing Information for KYPROLIS® to include a once-weekly dosing option in combination with dexamethasone for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The approval is based on data from the phase 3 ARROW (RAndomized, Open-label, Phase 3 Study in Subjects with Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma Receiving Carfilzomib in Combination with Dexamethasone, Comparing Once-Weekly versus Twice-Weekly Carfilzomib Dosing) study, which demonstrated that KYPROLIS®  administered once-weekly at 70 mg/m2 with dexamethasone achieved superior progression-free survival and overall response rates, with a comparable safety profile, versus twice-weekly KYPROLIS® administered at a dose of 27 mg/m2 in combination with dexamethasone. BiosimilarsAMGEVITA™  •In October 2018, we announced that AMGEVITA™ began launching in markets across Europe beginning in October 2018. Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeProduct sales           U.S.$4,260 $4,297 (1)% $12,774 $12,778 — %ROW1,250 1,156 8 % 3,758 3,448 9 %Total product sales5,510 5,453 1 % 16,532 16,226 2 %Other revenues394 320 23 % 985 821 20 %Total revenues$5,904 $5,773 2 % $17,517 $17,047 3 %Operating expenses$3,581 $3,334 7 % $9,636 $9,319 3 %Operating income$2,323 $2,439 (5)% $7,881 $7,728 2 %Net income$1,859 $2,021 (8)% $6,466 $6,243 4 %Diluted EPS$2.86 $2.76 4 % $9.61 $8.46 14 %Diluted shares649 733 (11)% 673 738 (9)%In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers (such as physicians or their clinics), dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.Total product sales increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, driven primarily by higher unit demand, offset partially by a decline in net selling price. Other revenues increased for the three months ended September 30, 2018, driven primarily by higher milestone payments. Other revenues increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, driven primarily by higher milestone payments and royalties.30Operating expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2018, driven primarily by higher manufacturing costs and investments in product launches and marketed product support. Operating expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, driven primarily by higher investments in product launches and marketed product support. All expense categories continued to benefit from our transformation and process improvement efforts, which enabled investment in newer and recently launched products.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeENBREL$1,292 $1,363 (5)% $3,699 $4,010 (8)%Neulasta®1,051 1,123 (6)% 3,306 3,420 (3)%Prolia® 532 464 15 % 1,636 1,394 17 %Aranesp®477 516 (8)% 1,403 1,562 (10)%XGEVA® 433 387 12 % 1,330 1,184 12 %Sensipar®/Mimpara®409 457 (11)% 1,326 1,305 2 %EPOGEN®252 264 (5)% 746 826 (10)%Other products1,064 879 21 % 3,086 2,525 22 %Total product sales$5,510 $5,453 1 % $16,532 $16,226 2 %Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed below and in the following sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017: (i) Item 1.

The decrease in ENBREL sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was driven primarily by lower unit demand.For 2018, we expect the trend of lower unit demand to continue. In addition, we continue to expect the 2018 net selling price to decline slightly compared with 2017. 31Multiple companies are developing proposed biosimilar versions of ENBREL, one of which was approved by the FDA in 2016. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigations with companies that are developing proposed biosimilar versions of ENBREL, see Note 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements; Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017; and Notes 14 and 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.Neulasta® Total Neulasta® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2018 2017 Change  2018 2017 ChangeNeulasta®— U.S.$897 $977 (8)% $2,854 $2,962 (4)%Neulasta®— ROW154 146 5 % 452 458 (1)%Total Neulasta®$1,051 $1,123 (6)% $3,306 $3,420 (3)%The decrease in global Neulasta® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018, was driven primarily by lower net selling price, lower unit demand and favorable prior-period changes in accounting estimates. The decrease in global Neulasta® sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was driven primarily by lower unit demand and unfavorable changes in accounting estimates, offset partially by an increase in net selling price.Neulasta® sales have been and will continue to be affected by the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new treatment alternatives, including those that have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of myelosuppressive regimens in some patients.Our final material U.S. patent for Neulasta® expired in October 2015. Therefore, we face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Neulasta®. A biosimilar version of Neulasta® was approved in the second quarter of 2018 and launched in July 2018. One company has a Biosimilar User Fee Action date for its biosimilar version of Neulasta® in the fourth quarter of 2018 and other biosimilar versions of Neulasta® may also receive approval in the near future. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigations with these and other companies that are developing proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta®, see Note 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements; Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017; and Notes 14 and 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.In addition, supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, that are related to our European patent for Neulasta® expired in August 2017.Prolia® Total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeProlia® — U.S.$354 $298 19% $1,070 $903 18%Prolia® — ROW178 166 7% 566 491 15%Total Prolia®$532 $464 15% $1,636 $1,394 17%The increases in global Prolia® sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, were driven primarily by higher unit demand. Prolia®, which has a six-month dosing interval, has exhibited a historical sales pattern, with the first and third quarters of a year representing lower sales than the second and fourth quarters of a year.32Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeAranesp® — U.S.$248 $285 (13)% $714 $851 (16)%Aranesp® — ROW229 231 (1)% 689 711 (3)%Total Aranesp®$477 $516 (8)% $1,403 $1,562 (10)%The decreases in global Aranesp® sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, were driven primarily by the impact of competition on unit demand. Aranesp® faces competition from a long-acting product. We expect to face competition from biosimilar versions of EPOGEN®. A biosimilar version of EPOGEN® was approved in the second quarter of 2018 and may launch. Other biosimilar versions of EPOGEN® may also receive approval. XGEVA®  Total XGEVA® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeXGEVA® — U.S.$323 $282 15% $994 $872 14%XGEVA® — ROW110 105 5% 336 312 8%Total XGEVA®$433 $387 12% $1,330 $1,184 12%The increases in global XGEVA® sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, were driven primarily by higher unit demand.Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeSensipar® — U.S.$330 $373 (12)% $1,069 $1,052 2%Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW79 84 (6)% 257 253 2%Total Sensipar®/Mimpara®$409 $457 (11)% $1,326 $1,305 2%The decrease in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018, was driven primarily by lower unit demand, which was due to continued adoption of Parsabiv® in the United States. The increase in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price. Our U.S. composition of matter patent related to Sensipar®, a small molecule, expired in March 2018. We are involved in patent litigations with a number of companies seeking to market generic versions of Sensipar®. See Note 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements; Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017; and Notes 14 and 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The forward looking outlook for Sensipar® is uncertain as generic competitors may enter the market at risk at any time.33EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeEPOGEN® — U.S.$252 $264 (5)% $746 $826 (10)%The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018, was driven primarily by a decrease in net selling price due to contractual terms negotiated with DaVita Inc. The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was driven primarily by a decrease in net selling price and, to a lesser extent, lower unit demand.  Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN® expired in May 2015. We face competition in the United States, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of EPOGEN®. Multiple companies are developing proposed biosimilar versions of EPOGEN®. A biosimilar version of EPOGEN® was approved in the second quarter of 2018 and may launch. Other biosimilar versions of EPOGEN® may also receive approval. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigation with one of these companies, see Note 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeKYPROLIS®— U.S.$142 $135 5 % $430 $412 4 %KYPROLIS®— ROW90 72 25 % 287 196 46 %Nplate®— U.S.107 96 11 % 326 292 12 %Nplate®— ROW70 63 11 % 209 185 13 %Vectibix®— U.S.71 65 9 % 214 188 14 %Vectibix®— ROW110 103 7 % 309 295 5 %Repatha®— U.S.72 62 16 % 254 155 64 %Repatha®— ROW48 27 78 % 137 66 *NEUPOGEN®— U.S.52 96 (46)% 180 287 (37)%NEUPOGEN®— ROW33 42 (21)% 110 136 (19)%Parsabiv® — U.S.92 — * 194 — *Parsabiv® — ROW10 2 * 22 2 *BLINCYTO® — U.S.33 34 (3)% 97 85 14 %BLINCYTO® — ROW25 18 39 % 70 44 59 %Aimovig® — U.S.22 — * 24 — *Other — U.S.23 21 10 % 64 55 16 %Other — ROW64 43 49 % 159 127 25 %Total other products$1,064 $879 21 % $3,086 $2,525 22 %Total U.S. — other products$614 $509 21 % $1,783 $1,474 21 %Total ROW — other products450 370 22 % 1,303 1,051 24 %Total other products$1,064 $879 21 % $3,086 $2,525 22 %* Change in excess of 100%.34Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30,   Nine months endedSeptember 30,   2018 2017 Change  2018 2017 ChangeOperating expenses:           Cost of sales$1,037 $990 5% $3,005 $3,010 — %% of product sales18.8% 18.2%   18.2% 18.6%  % of total revenues17.6% 17.1%   17.2% 17.7%  Research and development$926 $877 6% $2,555 $2,519 1 %% of product sales16.8% 16.1%   15.5% 15.5%  % of total revenues15.7% 15.2%   14.6% 14.8%  Selling, general and administrative$1,293 $1,170 11% $3,773 $3,443 10 %% of product sales23.5% 21.5%   22.8% 21.2%  % of total revenues21.9% 20.3%   21.5% 20.2%  Other$325 $297 9% $303 $347 (13)%Transformation and process improvementsDuring 2014, we announced transformation and process improvement efforts that we continue to execute. As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders.The transformation includes a restructuring plan that we estimate will result in pretax accounting charges in the range of $800 million to $850 million. As of September 30, 2018, restructuring costs incurred to date were $798 million. The charges that were recorded related to the restructuring during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, were not significant. Since 2014, we have realized approximately $1.6 billion of transformation and process improvement savings. Net savings have not been significant as savings were reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. Cost of salesCost of sales increased to 17.6% of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2018, driven primarily by higher manufacturing costs and higher acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets, offset partially by lower royalty costs and the favorable comparison to Hurricane Maria-related charges in the third quarter of 2017.Cost of sales decreased to 17.2% of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, driven primarily by lower royalty costs and a decrease in acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets, offset partially by higher manufacturing costs.Research and developmentR&D expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2018, driven primarily by increases in later-stage clinical programs of $59 million and Discovery Research and Translation Sciences of $35 million, offset partially by a decrease in marketed-product support of $45 million. R&D expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, driven primarily by increases in later-stage clinical programs of $77 million and Discovery Research and Translation Sciences of $82 million, offset partially by a decrease in marketed-product support of $123 million.Selling, general and administrativeThe increases in Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, were driven primarily by investments in product launches and marketed product support.OtherOther operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2018, increased due primarily to higher impairment-related charges associated with intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Other operating expenses for the nine months 35ended September 30, 2018, decreased due primarily to lower restructuring charges and favorable changes in fair values of contingent consideration, offset partially by higher impairment-related charges associated with intangible assets acquired in business combinations.Nonoperating expense/income and income taxesNonoperating expense/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedSeptember 30, Nine months endedSeptember 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017Interest expense, net$355 $325 $1,040 $972Interest and other income, net$126 $267 $519 $627Provision for income taxes$235 $360 $894 $1,140Effective tax rate11.2% 15.1% 12.1% 15.4%Interest expense, netThe increase in Interest expense, net, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, was due primarily to the impact of rising interest rates on variable-rate debt.Interest and other income, netThe decrease in Interest and other income, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2018, was due primarily to higher investment losses and reduced returns as a result of the liquidation of a portion of our portfolio. The decrease in Interest and other income, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was due primarily to higher investment losses and reduced returns as a result of the liquidation of a portion of our portfolio, offset partially by gains on our equity investments and a net gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of K-A in the first quarter of 2018. See Note 3, Business combinations, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.Income taxes The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, was due primarily to the impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform.On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the 2017 Tax Act, which imposes a repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, implements a hybrid territorial tax system together with a current tax on certain foreign earnings and lowers the general corporate income tax rate to 21%. In March 2018, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to incorporate SAB 118, which permits us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We continue to analyze the 2017 Tax Act and in certain areas have made reasonable estimates of the effects on our condensed consolidated financial statements and tax disclosures.The 2017 Tax Act includes U.S. taxation on foreign intangible income, effective January 1, 2018. The FASB allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as foreign intangible income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to the foreign intangible income as a period expense in the year it is incurred. We have recorded no provisional amount for deferred taxes on foreign intangible income because more time is needed to analyze the data in order to make an accounting policy election.We consider our key estimates on the repatriation tax, the net deferred tax remeasurement, the impact on our unrealized tax benefits and the accounting policy election on temporary basis differences related to foreign intangible income to be incomplete due to our continuing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We are still accumulating and processing data to update our underlying calculations, and we expect the U.S. Treasury and regulators may issue further guidance, among other things; therefore, our estimates may change during 2018. However, we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period.As previously disclosed, we received an RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. On November 29, 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRS calculations but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution through the IRS administrative appeals process, which we believe will likely not be concluded within the next 12 months. Final resolution of the IRS audit could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows if not resolved favorably, however, we believe our income tax reserves are appropriately provided for all open tax years. See Note 5, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.36Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$29,921 $41,678Total assets$67,333 $79,954Current portion of long-term debt$5,077 $1,152Long-term debt$29,350 $34,190Stockholders’ equity$14,349 $25,241Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesWe have global access to our $29.9 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as we no longer reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely outside the United States. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we recorded a repatriation tax liability on undistributed earnings generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions estimated at $7.3 billion, which will be paid over eight years. The first annual payment was made in April 2018.The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Capital allocationConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we seek to deploy our accumulated cash balances in an efficient manner, and we consider several alternatives such as share repurchases, payment of cash dividends, repayment of debt and strategic transactions that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest. We intend to continue to invest in our business and return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by stock price and blackout periods during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.In July 2018, March 2018 and December 2017, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.32 per share of common stock, which were paid on September 7, 2018, June 8, 2018 and March 8, 2018, respectively. In October 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.32 per share of common stock, which will be paid on December 7, 2018. We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we repurchased $15.7 billion of our stock, which included 52.1 million shares of common stock repurchased through a $10.0 billion tender offer. In April 2018, our Board of Directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by an additional $5.0 billion. As of September 30, 2018, $3.7 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program.As a result of stock repurchases, including our recent tender offer, and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Our accumulated deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt 37markets and equity markets. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Certain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant, which was modified during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The modified covenant requires that we maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA) to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the amended credit agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of September 30, 2018.Cash flowsOur summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): Nine months endedSeptember 30, 2018 2017Net cash provided by operating activities$8,102 $8,165Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$18,976 $(3,946)Net cash used in financing activities$(18,922) $(4,460)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, decreased compared with the same period in the prior year due primarily to higher cash taxes resulting from the first installment payment of repatriation tax arising from the 2017 Tax Act, net of reduced payments on our ongoing income tax liability, and the timing of payments to vendors, substantially offset by higher sales incentives and allowances to be paid to customers.InvestingCash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $19.3 billion, offset partially by capital expenditures of $513 million. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $3.3 billion and capital expenditures of $511 million. Capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, were associated primarily with manufacturing-capacity expansions in various locations, as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2018 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $15.7 billion, payment of dividends of $2.7 billion and repayment of debt of $500 million. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $2.5 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $2.4 billion and repayment of long-term debt, net of proceeds from debt issuances, of $920 million, offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper of $1.5 billion. See Note 12, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, under different assumptions or conditions, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.38Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and is incorporated herein by reference. There have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2018.Management determined that, as of September 30, 2018, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.39PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2018, and Note 14, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, provide additional disclosure for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability.Sales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue initiatives to contain costs and manage drug utilization. These payers are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result for our products in lower reimbursement rates or narrower populations for whom payers will reimburse. Continued intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs, together with payer dynamics, may limit our ability to set or adjust the price of our products based on their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In the United States, the public discussions of drug pricing issues are likely to continue.A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from U.S. federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by the U.S. federal and state governments. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Part I, Item 1. Business—Reimbursement. Changes to U.S. federal reimbursement policy may come through legislative and/or administrative actions. For example, in February 2018, the U.S. Congress passed legislation that requires biopharmaceutical manufacturers to pay greater discounts for patients in the Medicare Part D coverage gap beginning in 2019, which may reduce our net product sales relating to such patients. Other legislative proposals have been introduced into the U.S. Congress to overhaul provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and to enable commercial-level re-importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries. In May 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration released a drug pricing “blueprint” and requested public comment on an array of policy ideas intended to increase competition, improve the negotiating power of the federal government, reduce drug prices and lower patient out-of-pocket costs. The blueprint included a number of policy ideas with the potential to significantly impact, whether individually or collectively, our industry, including proposals to move coverage and reimbursement for Medicare Part B drugs into Medicare Part D, to require the inclusion of drug price information in direct-to-consumer drug advertising and to institute a competitive acquisition program for Part B drugs. The blueprint also proposed the removal of the safe-harbor protection under the federal anti-kickback statute for drug rebates paid to payers. Since the release of the drug pricing blueprint, senior administration officials have continued to state publicly their strong interest in changing the U.S. drug reimbursement system to eliminate rebates. Rebates are payments by a biopharmaceutical manufacturer of a portion of product’s purchase price back to the government program or private insurance plan responsible for paying for such product, or to the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who administer the prescription drug programs for government and private employers. While significant uncertainty remains as to how these or other changes might be accomplished, removal of the existing federal anti-kickback statute safe harbor protection for rebates may call into question the legality of such rebates in federal healthcare programs. This development or other changes affecting the ability or willingness 40of biopharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates could cause significant disruption in the current drug payment and reimbursement system. Changes in U.S. federal reimbursement policy may also arise as a result of executive actions, federal regulations, or demonstration projects implemented by federal agencies including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare, Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces. CMS has substantial power to implement policy changes or demonstration projects that can quickly and significantly affect how our products are covered and reimbursed. CMS has already begun implementing certain elements described in the administration’s drug pricing blueprint, including: issuing guidance to allow certain Medicare plans offered by private insurance companies to begin requiring that patients receiving Medicare Part B drugs first try a drug preferred by the plan before such plan will cover another therapy; and proposing new rules to require drug price information in direct-to-consumer (DTC) drug television advertising and to lower reimbursement rates for new Part B drugs launched beginning in 2019. Prior to CMS issuing its proposed DTC television advertising rule, we committed to the enhanced Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America voluntary DTC principles, which provide that, effective in 2019, all DTC television advertisements will direct patients to information about drug costs, including the list price of the medicine and out of pocket costs. On October 25, 2018, President Trump announced that CMS was evaluating a pilot program that proposes to set the Medicare payment amount for Part B single source drugs and biologics to more closely align with international drug prices and pay physicians and hospitals participating in such program a set drug add-on payment for administered drugs. CMS has since issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that requests public comment on the pilot program, which is proposed to initially cover fifty percent of Medicare Part B spending on separately payable Part B drugs. CMS has undertaken other projects to test care models, such as the CMS Oncology Care Model that provides participating physician practices with performance-based financial incentives that aim to manage or reduce Medicare costs without negatively impacting the efficacy of care. We believe the Oncology Care Model has reduced utilization of certain of our oncology products by participating physician practices and may continue to do so in the future. In addition, CMS has solicited suggestions regarding other potential care models. Further, President Trump’s administration is seeking to address drug prices through other federal agency actions. For example, to promote greater drug price competition, the FDA is pursuing policies that would ease generic and biosimilar entry requirements, including the lowering of standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability. See We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.While we are unable to predict which or how many of these various federal policy, legislative or regulatory changes may ultimately be enacted, to the extent that these or other federal government initiatives decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, limit our ability to offer co-pay payment assistance to commercial patients, require that we pay increased rebates or shift other costs to us, limit or impact our decisions regarding the pricing of biopharmaceutical products or otherwise reduce the use of our U.S. products, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. At the state level, government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed and/or create additional pressure on our pricing decisions. A number of states have adopted, and many other states have discussed and debated and are considering, new pricing legislation, including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information, limit price increases or to place a maximum price ceiling or cap on biopharmaceutical products. For example, in October 2017, California enacted a drug pricing transparency bill that requires biopharmaceutical manufacturers to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before scheduled prescription drug price increases that exceed certain thresholds. In addition, the Ohio Department of Medicaid recently ordered that all of the state’s Medicaid managed care plans terminate and renegotiate contracts with PBMs to eliminate the drug purchasing model in which PBMs bill the state more than they reimburse pharmacists for filling Medicaid patient prescriptions. Other states could adopt similar approaches, which could create additional uncertainty in the Medicaid reimbursement setting. These existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be impacting industry pricing decisions. Ultimately, as with U.S. federal government actions, existing or future state government actions may also have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Payers, including healthcare insurers, PBMs and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek ways to reduce their and their respective members’ costs. Many payers continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient co-pay or co-insurance obligations and limitations on patients’ use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs). Payers have sought and will likely continue to seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage, particularly in treatment areas where the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as requiring that the patient first try a drug preferred by the payer or receive the payer’s prior authorization before covering the product, and may choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely. For example, the burdensome administrative process required for physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha® has been prescribed meet the payers’ utilization management criteria has limited patient access to Repatha® treatment. In an effort to reduce access 41burdens, we have taken a number of actions to reduce the net price of Repatha® through offering greater discounts and rebates to payers. Even with increased access, patient out-of-pocket expense has and may continue to limit patient use. For example, a very high percentage of Medicare patients have abandoned their Repatha® prescriptions rather than pay their co-pay payment. In October 2018, we introduced a set of new NDCs to make Repatha® available at a lower list price to attempt to address affordability for patients, particularly those on Medicare. Despite the recent net price reductions, payers may continue to restrict patient access, change formulary coverage for Repatha®, seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions that could reduce our sales of Repatha®. Further, our introduction of the new NDCs may not be rapidly adopted by payers, which could continue to limit patient use and could also reduce our sales of Repatha®.Significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantly increasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage. For example, in the United States, the top three PBMs now oversee more than 70% of prescription claims and the top three health insurance companies’ coverage is approaching half of government and commercial covered lives. Consolidation between pharmacies is also increasing, with the top three pharmacies now responsible for half of U.S. drug sales. The consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including through integrated delivery systems and/or with specialty pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers and has resulted in greater price discounts on our products, fees for other services and rebates. For example, U.S. regulators have recently approved the mergers of two of the nation’s largest PBMs, Express Scripts and CVS Health, with major insurance companies Cigna and Aetna, respectively. Further consolidation would increase the leverage of such entities. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products.Outside the United States, we expect countries will continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Part I, Item 1. Business—Reimbursement. For example, international reference pricing (IRP) is widely used by a large number of countries to control costs based on an external benchmark of a product’s price in other countries. IRP policies can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. In addition, countries may exclude or limit coverage and reimbursement for a product when their national health technology assessments do not indicate that the product demonstrates sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies. For example, reimbursement for Repatha® in France and Germany may remain limited to relatively narrow patient populations following recent national health technology assessments. While the pricing and reimbursement process in those countries remains ongoing, these assessments have negatively impacted our efforts in France and Germany to expand Repatha® access to the broader patient population covered by the approved label. Any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our products or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or could otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. In the United States, pricing data that we submit to the U.S. government impacts the payment rates for providers, rebates we pay, and discounts we are required to provide under Medicare, Medicaid and other government drug programs. Government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. Our price reporting data calculations are reviewed monthly and quarterly, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions and/or underlying data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.We currently face competition from biosimilars in both Europe and the United States, and we expect to face increasing biosimilar and/or generics competition this year and beyond. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights or expiration of an applicable exclusivity period would accelerate such competition, and we expect to face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products may also experience greater competition from lower-cost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars and generics, the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate.In the European Union, biosimilars are evaluated for marketing authorization pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some EU countries have adopted and others are attempting to adopt biosimilar uptake measures such as requiring physician prescribing 42quotas or promoting switching or pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products, and other countries may adopt similar measures. Some EU countries impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of one or more biosimilar competitors.In the United States, the ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Part I, Item 1. Business—Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Approval of Biosimilars. The first biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market, Sandoz’s Zarxio®, is a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN®, and was launched in the United States in 2015. Since then, the FDA has approved additional biosimilars, including biosimilar versions of ENBREL, Neulasta® and EPOGEN®, and a growing number of companies have announced that they are also developing biosimilar versions of our products. One biosimilar version of Neulasta® launched earlier this year and others may also receive approval in the near future; the approved biosimilar version of EPOGEN® may also launch. We believe that when multiple biosimilar versions of one of our products are approved and launched, competition could intensify more rapidly, resulting in a greater impact on such product’s sales. Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents. For information related to our biosimilars and generics patent litigation, see Note 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements, Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and Notes 14 and 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively. See also our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. The U.S. pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. Some companies currently developing or already marketing biosimilars may seek to register their products as interchangeable biosimilars, which could make it easier for pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our reference products or could encourage prescribers or payers who are inclined to select the interchangeable biosimilar over our innovative products or our biosimilars. In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law’s provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. For example, the FDA is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product’s original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as “umbrella exclusivity”). If the FDA were to decide that “umbrella exclusivity” does not apply to biological reference products or were to make other changes to the exclusivity period, this could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, public, legislative, and FDA efforts to promote price competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar entry, including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, and through changes to the reimbursement policies for biologics. While most of our products are biologics, some of our products are small molecule products. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a small molecule product, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. The FDA approval process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy and allows generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product, often enabling these generic competitors to market competing versions of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent at a much lower price. Our U.S. composition of matter patent for Sensipar®, a small molecule product, expired in March 2018. We are engaged in litigation with a number of companies seeking to market generic versions of Sensipar® surrounding our U.S. formulation patent that expires in September 2026. See Note 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements, Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and Notes 14 and 15, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively. Several of these generic versions of Sensipar® have been approved by the FDA, and one or more of these companies may elect to launch their approved generic versions at risk, prior to the conclusion of our ongoing litigation. If this happens, our product sales for Sensipar® could be materially and adversely affected. While we are unable to predict the precise impact of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere this year and beyond as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had and could increasingly have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. Professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians’ groups, private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases also publish guidelines and recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, as well as patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may 43relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies. In addition, a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of biopharmaceutical products, and even organizations whose guidelines have historically been focused on clinical matters may begin to incorporate analyses of the cost effectiveness of various treatments into their treatment guidelines and recommendations. Value assessments may come from private organizations that publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products’ reimbursement by government and private payers. Some companies and payers have announced pricing and payment decisions based in part on the assessments of private organizations. For example, CVS Caremark indicated in August 2018 that it will begin utilizing third-party cost effectiveness analyses to make formulary and coverage determinations for newly-approved drugs. In addition, government health technology assessment organizations in many countries make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service impact of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Such health technology assessment organizations may recommend reimbursement for our product for a narrower indication than was approved by applicable regulatory agencies or may recommend against reimbursement entirely. Such recommendations or guidelines may affect our reputation, and any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSDuring the three months ended September 30, 2018, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program, under which the repurchase activity was as follows:Period Total numberof sharespurchased Averageprice paidper share (1) Total numberof shares purchasedas part of publicly announced program Maximum dollarvalue that mayyet be purchasedunder the program (2)July 1 - 31 3,018,400 $191.69 3,018,400 $4,814,509,041August 1 - 31 3,197,500 $197.03 3,197,500 $4,184,499,911September 1 - 30 2,498,600 $202.12 2,498,600 $3,679,470,791Total 8,714,500 $196.64 8,714,500  (1) Average price paid per share includes related expenses.(2) In April 2018, our Board of Directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by an additional $5.0 billion.Item 6.
