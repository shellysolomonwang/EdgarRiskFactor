MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2012, and June 30, 2012. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with GAAP.Amgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as “Amgen,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a global biotechnology pioneer that discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative human therapeutics. Our medicines help millions of patients in the fight against cancer, kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, bone disease, and other serious illnesses. We operate in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.Currently, we market primarily recombinant protein therapeutics in supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products are Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim), ENBREL (etanercept) and our erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs): Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa) and EPOGEN® (epoetin alfa). Our product sales outside the United States consist principally of sales in Europe. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, our principal products represented 81% and 82% of worldwide product sales, respectively; and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, our principal products represented 86% and 88% of worldwide product sales, respectively. Our other marketed products include principally Sensipar®/Mimpara® (cinacalcet), Vectibix® (panitumumab), Nplate® (romiplostim), XGEVA® (denosumab) and Prolia® (denosumab).24Significant developmentsFollowing is a summary of selected significant developments affecting our business that have occurred to date since June 30, 2012. For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2012, and June 30, 2012.Products/PipelineSensipar® •On November 3, 2012, we presented at American Society of Nephrology's Kidney Week the results of the phase 3 E.V.O.L.V.E™ (EValuation Of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events) trial. As previously reported, the primary analysis showed that the trial did not reach its primary endpoint (time to composite event comprising all-cause mortality or first non-fatal cardiovascular event, including myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure or peripheral vascular event) in the intent-to-treat analysis (see Significant Developments in our Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2012). Baseline characteristics between the Sensipar®/Mimpara® and placebo groups were generally well-balanced with the notable exception of age - an important predictor of death and cardiovascular events. Patients in the Sensipar®/Mimpara® group were one-year older than those in the placebo group (median age 55 and 54 years, respectively). A pre-specified analysis adjusting for baseline imbalances showed that treatment with Sensipar®/Mimpara® resulted in a 12% reduction in the primary endpoint (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.88, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.79 to 0.97). Discontinuation of investigational product was common in both arms and more frequent in the placebo group (66.7% versus 70.5%, respectively). Reasons for discontinuation included kidney transplant, parathyroidectomy, adverse events, and patient request. A pre-specified analysis, which excluded data from patients that was collected beyond six months after stopping investigational product, showed a 15% reduction in the primary endpoint (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95).AMG 145•On November 5 and 6, 2012, we presented data from four phase 2 studies evaluating AMG 145 as monotherapy, in combination with statin therapy, in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), and in statin-intolerant subjects. In each of these studies treatment with AMG 145 resulted in statistically significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared to the control arms at 12 weeks. Results from the MENDEL study (evaluating AMG 145 as monotherapy) demonstrated that treatment with AMG 145 reduced LDL-C by up to 47% compared to placebo when dosed every 2 weeks (Q2W) (mean reductions from baseline of 41% in the 70 mg group, 44% in the 105 mg group and 51% in the 140 mg group, versus 4% for placebo) and up to 53% compared to placebo when dosed every four weeks (Q4W) (mean reductions from baseline of 39% in the 280 mg group, 43% in the 350 mg group and 48% in the 420 mg group, versus 5% increase for placebo). In the MENDEL study, the most common adverse events (AEs) reported for AMG 145 were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and diarrhea. Results from the LAPLACE-TIMI 57 study (evaluating AMG 145 in hypercholesterolemic patients with statins) demonstrated that adding AMG 145 to statin therapy reduced LDL-C by up to 66% compared to placebo when dosed Q2W (mean reductions versus placebo of 42% in the 70 mg group, 60% in the 105 mg group and 66% in the 140 mg group) and up to 50% when dosed Q4W (mean reductions versus placebo of 42% in the 280 mg group, 50% in the 350 mg group and 50% in the 420 mg group). In the LAPLACE-TIMI 57 study, the most common AEs reported for the AMG 145 group were nasopharyngitis, cough and nausea. Results from the RUTHERFORD study (evaluating AMG 145 in combination with statin therapy, with or without ezetimibe, in patients with HeFH) showed treatment with AMG 145 dosed Q4W reduced LDL-C by up to 56% versus placebo (mean reductions from baseline of 43% in the 350 mg group and 55% in the 420 mg group, versus an increase of 1% for placebo). In the RUTHERFORD study, the most common AEs reported for the AMG 145 group were nasopharyngitis, injection-site reaction and headache. Results from the GAUSS study (evaluating AMG 145 in hypercholesterolemic patients who cannot tolerate statins) demonstrated that treatment with AMG 145 dosed Q4W reduced LDL-C from baseline by up to 51% with AMG 145 (mean reductions from baseline of 41% in the AMG 145 280 mg group, 43% in the AMG 145 350 mg group and 51% in the AMG 145 420 mg group versus 15% in the placebo/ezetimibe 10 mg group) and up to 63% with the combination of AMG 145 and ezetimibe (mean reductions from baseline of 63% in the AMG 145 420 mg/ezetimibe 10 mg group versus 15% in the placebo/ezetimibe 10 mg group). In the GAUSS study, the most common AEs reported for the AMG 145 group were myalgia, nasopharyngitis, nausea and fatigue. Brodalumab (AMG 827)•On October 23, 2012, we announced the start of a phase 3 program in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The program consists of three phase 3 studies, with ustekinumab and/or placebo controls. Brodalumab is one of five inflammation monoclonal antibodies being jointly developed in the collaboration with AstraZeneca that was announced in April 2012.25Prolia®  •On September 20, 2012, we announced that the FDA approved a new indication for Prolia® as a treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.Selected financial informationFollowing is an overview of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, as well as our financial condition as of September 30, 2012 (amounts in millions, except percentages and per-share data): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2012 2011 Change 2012 2011 ChangeProduct sales:           U.S.$3,248 $2,965 10 % $9,500 $8,718 9 %ROW953 912 4 % 2,802 2,670 5 %Total product sales4,201 3,877 8 % 12,302 11,388 8 %Other revenues118 67 76 % 542 221 *Total revenues$4,319 $3,944 10 % $12,844 $11,609 11 %Operating expenses$2,896 $3,419 (15)% $8,355 $8,459 (1)%Operating income$1,423 $525 * $4,489 $3,150 43 %Net income$1,107 $454 * $3,557 $2,749 29 %Diluted EPS$1.41 $0.50 * $4.51 $2.96 52 %Diluted shares783 914 (14)% 789 930 (15)%* Change in excess of 100%The increases in U.S. product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, reflect growth for most of our marketed products. ESAs declined 11% for both periods. Excluding ESAs, U.S. product sales increased 16% for both periods.The increases in rest-of-the-world (ROW) product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, reflect growth for all of our marketed products except Aranesp®, which declined 3% and 5%, and combined Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®, which declined 12% and 10%, in the respective periods.The increase in other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2012, was driven by: (i) a milestone payment received in the quarter related to the initiation of the brodalumab (AMG 827) phase 3 psoriasis study and (ii) revenue earned in the quarter related to motesanib. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was driven by a modification to our Takeda collaboration in the second quarter of 2012 which replaced a global co-development and profit share agreement for motesanib, originally signed in 2008, with an exclusive license for Takeda to develop, manufacture and commercialize motesanib. That modification resulted in revenue recognition of $232 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2012, also reflect milestone payments received earlier in the year from AstraZeneca and Astellas Pharma Inc.The decrease in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2012, was due primarily to the negative impact in 2011 from a previously disclosed charge for a legal settlement reserve of $780 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the impact from the 2011 legal settlement reserve was offset largely by increases in cost of sales, Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) and R&D spending.The increases in net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, were due primarily to higher operating income, offset partially by higher interest expense, net, and higher effective income tax rates in the 2012 periods.The increases in diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, were driven primarily by increases in net income and, to a lesser extent, by the favorable impacts of our stock repurchase program, which reduced the number of shares used to compute diluted EPS.Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the purchase of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is imposed on the gross intercompany purchase price of the goods and services and is effective for a six-year period beginning in 2011, with the excise tax rate declining in each year (4% in 2011, 3.75% in 262012, 2.75% in 2013, 2.5% in 2014, 2.25% in 2015 and 1% in 2016). We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes when the excise tax is incurred. This excise tax has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our cost of sales and a significant favorable impact on our provision for income taxes. In addition, the overall impact of the excise tax will vary from period to period as a result of the timing difference between recognizing the expense and the applicable tax credit. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, cost of sales increased by $87 million and $253 million, respectively, compared with $74 million and $132 million for the corresponding periods of the prior year. The provision for income taxes decreased by $82 million and $264 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, respectively, as a result of this excise tax compared with $106 million and $259 million for the corresponding periods of the prior year.As of September 30, 2012, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $25.4 billion and total debt outstanding was $26.5 billion. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of September 30, 2012, approximately $18.8 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates.Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2012 2011 Change  2012 2011 Change Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN ®$1,355 $1,335 1 % $4,046 $3,893 4 %ENBREL1,079 925 17 % 3,075 2,756 12 %Aranesp®497 600 (17)% 1,551 1,765 (12)%EPOGEN®491 476 3 % 1,462 1,554 (6)%Other products779 541 44 % 2,168 1,420 53 %Total product sales$4,201 $3,877 8 % $12,302 $11,388 8 %Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others do.

The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was due 27primarily to a decrease in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in unit demand from loss of share to biosimilars in Europe.The decrease in global NEUPOGEN® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2012, was driven primarily by a decrease in unit demand from loss of share to biosimilars in Europe. Global NEUPOGEN® sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, increased 1%.Our outstanding material U.S. patents for Filgrastim (NEUPOGEN®) expire in December 2013. We expect to face competition in the United States beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013 which may have a material adverse impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN® and, in turn, Neulasta®. See Financial condition, liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of the potential impact of patent expiration. Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) expires in 2015.Future Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. Certain of those factors may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2012 2011 Change  2012 2011 Change ENBREL — U.S.$1,012 $863 17% $2,881 $2,578 12%ENBREL — Canada67 62 8% 194 178 9%Total ENBREL$1,079 $925 17% $3,075 $2,756 12%The increases in total ENBREL sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, were driven primarily by increases in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, increases in unit demand.Future ENBREL sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.

The unit declines reflect changes in practice patterns resulting from changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred during 2011. For the three months ended September 30, 2012, the decrease to sales was also driven by a change in accounting estimates in 2011 that resulted in $34 million of the year-over-year decline in the quarter.The decrease in ROW Aranesp® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2012, was 3%. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was 5% due primarily to a decrease in the average net sales price.Sequentially, global Aranesp® unit demand was down 3% in the quarter ended September 30, 2012, compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2012, due to a small share loss in the oncology segment in the United States.Future Aranesp® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. Certain of those factors may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp®.EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):28 Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2012 2011 Change  2012 2011 Change EPOGEN® — U.S.$491 $476 3% $1,462 $1,554 (6)%The increase in EPOGEN® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2012, was driven by reductions in customer discounts, as part of new provider contracts that became effective January 1, 2012, and by a year-over-year favorable change in accounting estimates of $36 million. These increases were offset largely by a 15% decrease in unit demand, driven by reductions in dose utilization due to changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred in 2011. The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was driven by a 22% decrease in unit demand due to the impact of the 2011 changes, offset partially by reductions in customer discounts and by a year-over-year favorable change in accounting estimates of $76 million.Sequentially, EPOGEN® sales decreased 6% in the quarter ended September 30, 2012, compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2012, due to customer buying patterns and competition.Future EPOGEN® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2012.

Cost of sales increased to 16.8% of product sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, driven primarily by the Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the impacts of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 14.7% and 14.4% of product sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.Research and developmentThe increase in R&D expense for the three months ended September 30, 2012, was driven primarily by increased costs associated with supporting later-stage clinical programs of $107 million, driven by AMG 145 and romosozumab (AMG 785), and increases in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities of $25 million, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $13 million.The increase in R&D expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was driven primarily by increased costs associated with supporting later-stage clinical programs of $223 million, including AMG 145 and romosozumab (AMG 785), offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $73 million and decreases in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities of $24 million.Selling, general and administrativeSG&A expenses were flat for the three months ended September 30, 2012. Higher ENBREL profit share expenses of $58 million were offset by favorable changes to the 2011 and estimated 2012 U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fees,which decreased SG&A by $31 million year-over-year, and by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $29 million.The increase in SG&A for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was driven primarily by higher ENBREL profit share expenses of $120 million as well as international expansion of $71 million, offset partially by favorable changes to the 2011 and estimated 2012 U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fees, which decreased SG&A by $95 million year-over-year.Under our ENBREL collaboration agreement, we currently pay Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada attributable to all approved indications for ENBREL on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, we maintain a majority share of ENBREL profits. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share were $386 million and $1,081 million, respectively, compared with $328 million and $961 million for the corresponding periods of the prior year. After expiration of the agreement in the fourth quarter of 2013, we will be required to pay Pfizer a declining percentage of annual net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada for three years, ranging from 12% to 10%. The amounts of such payments are anticipated to be significantly less than what would be owed based on the terms of the current ENBREL profit share.OtherOther operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, included certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives of $36 million and $106 million, legal proceedings charges of $53 million and $65 million, and other operating expenses of $21 million and $24 million, respectively. 30Other operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 included a legal settlement charge of $780 million, certain charges related to cost savings initiatives of $68 million and $79 million, and other operating expenses of $6 million and $14 million, respectively.Non-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2012 2011 2012 2011Interest expense, net$271 $158 $762 $415Interest and other income, net$111 $87 $359 $364Provisions for income taxes$156 $— $529 $350Effective tax rate12.4% —% 12.9% 11.3%Interest expense, netThe increases in interest expense, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, were due primarily to a higher average debt balance.Interest and other income, netThe increase in interest and other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2012, is due primarily to higher interest income as a result of a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The decrease in interest and other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was due primarily to lower net realized gains on investments, offset partially by higher interest income due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.Income taxesOur effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, were 12.4% and 12.9%, respectively, compared with 0.0% and 11.3% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2012, increased due to the prior year impacts of the legal settlement charge and additional foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax, as well as the tax impact of changes in revenue and expense mix. In addition, our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, increased due to the exclusion of the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2011. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax and the legal settlement charge, our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, would have been 17.7% and 18.3%, respectively, compared with 13.9% and 17.1% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): September 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$25,374 $20,641Total assets55,448 48,871Current portion of long-term debt2,458 84Long-term debt24,020 21,344Stockholders’ equity19,902 19,029The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, Item 1A. Risk 31Factors—There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.) In October 2011, we announced our intent to accelerate our stock repurchase program and that our Board of Directors had authorized an increase in our stock repurchase program to $10 billion, reflecting our confidence in the long-term value of the Company and the attractive interest rate environment. Subsequent to the October 2011 Board of Directors authorization through December 2011, we repurchased 83.3 million shares at an aggregate cost of $5.0 billion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2012, we repurchased 48.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $3.4 billion. This brings the total shares repurchased under this approved program to 131.4 million at a total cost of $8.4 billion at an average price of $64.19 per share. As of September 30, 2012, $1.6 billion remained available under this stock repurchase program. In December 2011, March 2012 and July 2012, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.36 per share of common stock, which were paid on March 7, June 7 and September 7, 2012, respectively, and totaled $844 million. On October 10, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share of common stock, which will be paid on December 7, 2012, to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 15, 2012.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in each case for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as “U.S. funds”) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to repurchase stock and pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. During the nine months ended September 30, 2012, we issued an additional $5.0 billion of long-term debt. We now have adequate U.S. funding to complete the $10 billion of stock repurchases authorized under our stock repurchase program and to pay the $2.5 billion due when our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes mature in the first quarter of 2013. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Current global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside of the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent, in part, on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and the trend has worsened over time as regional economic uncertainty has increased. In particular, deteriorating credit and economic conditions in southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of September 30, 2012, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $436 million, of which $308 million was past due, with the past due receivables primarily in Italy, Spain and Portugal. Although economic conditions in this region may continue affecting the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary.Over the next several years, many of the existing patents on our principal products will expire. As a result, we expect to face increasing competition thereafter, including from biosimilars, that may have a material adverse impact on our product sales, results of operations and liquidity. In the EU, there is already an established regulatory pathway for biosimilars and we are facing increasing competition from biosimilars. The 2010 U.S. healthcare reform legislation authorized the FDA to approve biosimilar products under a new, abbreviated pathway. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, Item 1. Business - Marketed Products.) In the United States after patent expiration, we expect to face greater competition, including from manufacturers with biosimilar products approved in Europe that may seek to quickly obtain U.S. approval. Upon patent expiration for small molecule products, there is typically intense competition from generics manufacturers, which generally leads to significant and rapid declines in sales of the branded product. Given that our principal products are biologics, we do not believe the impact of biosimilar competition will be as significant as with small molecule products, in part because successful competitors must have a broad range of specialized skills and capabilities unique to biologics, including significant regulatory, clinical and manufacturing expertise, and since the products are similar but not identical, the biosimilars will have to compete against products with established efficacies and safety records. We have many opportunities to grow our business, including the continued commercialization of XGEVA® and Prolia® and expansion into emerging markets and Japan, which we believe may offset the adverse financial impact of our principal products’ patent expiries.32Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of September 30, 2012.Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Nine months ended September 30, 2012 2011Net cash provided by operating activities$5,070 $3,535Net cash used in investing activities(7,959) (566)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities1,766 (2,365)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, increased due primarily to the timing and amount of receipts from customers and payments to vendors and taxing authorities, cash received in connection with the termination of our interest rate swap agreements of $397 million and the impact of decreased inventory related expenditures.InvestingCash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was due primarily to net purchases of marketable securities of $5.4 billion and the acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired of $2.0 billion. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was due primarily to cash used to acquire businesses, net of cash acquired of $701 million, offset partially by net sales of marketable securities of $467 million.Capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, totaled $489 million and $343 million, respectively. Capital expenditures during both the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, were associated primarily with manufacturing-capacity expansions in Ireland and Puerto Rico and other site developments. We currently estimate 2012 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.FinancingCash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was due primarily to the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.9 billion and the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company’s equity award programs of $1.1 billion, offset partially by repurchases of our common stock of $3.4 billion and the payment of dividends of $844 million.Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $3.0 billion, the repayment of $2.5 billion of long-term debt and the payment of dividends of $255 million, offset partially by the issuance of long-term debt and commercial paper of $3.3 billion.See Note 9, Financing arrangements, and Note 10, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2012.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, and is incorporated herein by reference. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.33Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsDuring the three months ended June 30, 2012, due to historically low interest rates, we terminated all of our interest rate swap contracts which had an aggregate notional amount of $3.6 billion, resulting in the receipt of $397 million from the counterparties. This amount is being recognized in earnings over the remaining lives of the debt issuances that were related to these interest rate swap contracts and will not significantly impact earnings for any fiscal year.During the three months ended September 30, 2012, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the entire principal amount of the debt denominated in pounds sterling and euros that we issued during this period. As of September 30, 2012, we had open cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $2.7 billion that effectively convert payments on certain of our foreign currency denominated debt securities to U.S. dollars and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at September 30, 2012, would have resulted in approximately a $420 million reduction in the fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts on this date, but would have no effect on cash flows or income in the ensuing year.Foreign currency sensitive financial instrumentsAs of September 30, 2012, we had outstanding pound sterling and euro denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at September 30, 2012, on the $3.8 billion fair value, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $750 million on this date with a corresponding reduction in income in the ensuing year, but would have no effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis for this debt does not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the related cross-currency swap contracts which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt.With regard to our $2.7 billion notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in pounds sterling and euros, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at September 30, 2012, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair value of these contracts of approximately $700 million on this date, but would have no effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The impact on income in the ensuing year from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical change in the carrying amount of the related hedged debt of approximately $590 million.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as the term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2012.Management determined that, as of September 30, 2012, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, 2012, June 30, 2012, and March 31, 2012, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings.
