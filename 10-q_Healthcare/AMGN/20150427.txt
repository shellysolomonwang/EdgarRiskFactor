We market several other products, including Vectibix® (panitumumab), Nplate® (romiplostim), Kyprolis® (carfilzomib) and BLINCYTO® (blinatumomab).21Significant developmentsFollowing is a summary of selected significant developments affecting our business that have occurred since December 31, 2014. For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.Products/Pipeline CardiovascularCorlanor® (ivabradine)•In April 2015, we announced that the FDA granted approval of Corlanor®  to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with stable, symptomatic chronic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35 percent, who are in sinus rhythm with resting heart rate ≥70 beats per minute and either are on maximally tolerated doses of beta blockers or have a contraindication to beta blocker use. Commercial sales launched in April 2015.Repatha™ (evolocumab)*•In March 2015, we announced that we submitted an application seeking marketing approval of Repatha™ for the treatment of high cholesterol to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan.NephrologyAMG 416 •In February 2015, we announced results from the head-to-head phase 3 study comparing AMG 416 with cinacalcet for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease receiving hemodialysis. The study met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority of AMG 416 compared to cinacalcet.OncologyKyprolis® •In March 2015, we announced that the FDA accepted the supplemental New Drug Application of Kyprolis® for the treatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. As part of the acceptance, the FDA granted Kyprolis® priority review.•In March 2015, we announced the results from a planned interim analysis showing that the phase 3 head-to-head clinical trial ENDEAVOR evaluating Kyprolis® in combination with low-dose dexamethasone versus Velcade® (bortezomib) and low-dose dexamethasone met the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS). Patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with Kyprolis® lived approximately twice as long without their disease worsening, demonstrating statistically and clinically significant superiority over Velcade®.•In April 2015, we announced the initiation of a phase 3 study with weekly dosing in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.Neulasta® •In March 2015, we announced the Neulasta® Delivery Kit is now available in the United States. The Neulasta® Delivery Kit includes a specially designed single-use prefilled syringe co-packaged with the new On-body Injector for Neulasta®. The Neulasta® Delivery Kit enables the healthcare provider to initiate administration of Neulasta® on the same day as cytotoxic chemotherapy—with delivery of the patient's full dose of Neulasta® the day following chemotherapy administration, consistent with the Neulasta® prescribing information. This frees patients from a return visit to their healthcare provider the day after chemotherapy.Talimogene laherparepvec•In February 2015, we announced that the CTGTAC and the ODAC of the FDA will jointly review our talimogene laherparepvec BLA at a meeting on April 29, 2015. These advisory committees review marketed and investigational human drug products, including safety and effectiveness data, and make recommendations to the FDA. The FDA will consider the advisory committees' recommendations in its review of our talimogene laherparepvec BLA. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date for completion of FDA review of our talimogene laherparepvec BLA for the treatment of patients with injectable regionally or distantly metastatic melanoma is October 27, 2015.* FDA provisionally approved trade name22Trebananib•In April 2015, we announced that we stopped administration of blinded investigational product in the phase 3 study of trebananib in first-line ovarian cancer based on a recommendation by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee, who deemed the study unlikely to achieve its primary PFS endpoint.Vectibix® •In April 2015, we announced that the European Commission approved a new use of Vectibix® as first-line treatment in combination with FOLFIRI for the treatment of adult patients with wild-type (WT) RAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). About half of the patients with mCRC have WT RAS tumors. FOLFIRI, an irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimen, is frequently used in first-line colorectal cancer treatment in Europe.Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data):  Three months ended    March 31,    2015 2014 ChangeProduct sales:      U.S. $3,771 $3,289 15 %Rest of the world (ROW) 1,103 1,067 3 %Total product sales 4,874 4,356 12 %Other revenues 159 165 (4)%Total revenues $5,033 $4,521 11 %Operating expenses $3,011 $3,157 (5)%Operating income $2,022 $1,364 48 %Net income $1,623 $1,073 51 %Diluted EPS $2.11 $1.40 51 %Diluted shares 770 768 — %The increase in global product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2015, was driven by ENBREL, Prolia®, EPOGEN®, Sensipar® and XGEVA®.The decrease in operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2015, was driven primarily as a result of savings from transformation and process improvement efforts under our restructuring plan, offset partially by increased investments for launching new products.The increases in net income and diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2015, were driven by an increase in operating income.23Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2015 2014 Change Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® $1,380 $1,379 —%ENBREL 1,116 988 13%XGEVA®  340 279 22%Prolia®  272 196 39%EPOGEN® 534 462 16%Aranesp® 480 460 4%Sensipar®/Mimpara® 334 270 24%Other products 418 322 30%Total product sales $4,874 $4,356 12%Future sales of our products are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others.

The decrease in global NEUPOGEN® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2015, was driven primarily by a decrease in U.S. unit demand due to the impact of short-acting competition. We face competition in the United States, which could have an impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN® and, to a lesser extent, Neulasta®. Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta® ) expires in October 2015. Apotex, Inc. announced that the FDA accepted for filing their applications, under the abbreviated pathway, for pegfilgrastim, a biosimilar version of Neulasta®, on December 17, 2014, and for filgrastim, a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN®, on February 17, 2015. On March 6, 2015, Sandoz, a Novartis company, announced that the FDA approved its biosimilar filgrastim Zarxio™ for all indications included in the reference product’s (NEUPOGEN®) label. The Sandoz biosimilar filgrastim is the subject of ongoing litigation between us and Sandoz. See Note 12, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.24ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2015 2014 Change ENBREL — U.S. $1,052 $924 14%ENBREL — Canada 64 64 —%Total ENBREL $1,116 $988 13%The increase in ENBREL sales for the three months ended March 31, 2015, was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by a slight decline in units.XGEVA® and Prolia®  Total XGEVA® and total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2015 2014 Change XGEVA® — U.S. $245 $200 23%XGEVA® — ROW 95 79 20%Total XGEVA® 340 279 22%Prolia® — U.S. 170 119 43%Prolia® — ROW 102 77 32%Total Prolia® 272 196 39%Total XGEVA®/Prolia® $612 $475 29%The increases in global XGEVA® and Prolia® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2015, were driven by increases in unit demand.

As a result, we may face competition in the United States, which may have a material adverse impact over time on EPOGEN® sales. In addition, EPOGEN® and Aranesp® compete with MIRCERA® in the United States. F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. (Roche) began selling MIRCERA® in October 2014 in the United States. MIRCERA® competes with Aranesp® in the nephrology segment only. On December 16, 2014, Hospira, Inc. submitted a BLA to the FDA for Retacrit™, a proposed biosimilar to EPOGEN®, under the abbreviated pathway.25Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2015 2014 Change Aranesp® — U.S. $189 $177 7%Aranesp® — ROW 291 283 3%Total Aranesp® $480 $460 4%The increase in global Aranesp® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2015, was driven largely by unit demand in international markets.Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2015 2014 Change Sensipar® — U.S. $241 $178 35%Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW 93 92 1%Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® $334 $270 24%The increase in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2015, was driven primarily by an increase in unit demand, favorable changes in U.S. wholesaler inventories and an increase in the U.S. average net sales price.Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2015 2014 Change Vectibix® — U.S. $47 $39 21 %Vectibix® — ROW 75 64 17 %Nplate® — U.S. 78 62 26 %Nplate® — ROW 48 51 (6)%Kyprolis® — U.S. 97 62 56 %Kyprolis® — ROW 11 6 83 %BLINCYTO® — U.S. 15 — N/AOther — ROW 47 38 24 %Total other products $418 $322 30 %Total U.S. — other products $237 $163 45 %Total ROW — other products 181 159 14 %Total other products $418 $322 30 %26Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2015 2014 Change Cost of sales $1,033 $1,090 (5)%% of product sales 21.2% 25.0%  % of total revenues 20.5% 24.1%  Research and development $894 $1,027 (13)%% of product sales 18.3% 23.6%  % of total revenues 17.8% 22.7%  Selling, general and administrative $1,026 $1,023 — %% of product sales 21.1% 23.5%  % of total revenues 20.4% 22.6%  Other $58 $17 ** Change in excess of 100%RestructuringDuring the second half of 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan to invest in continuing innovation and the launch of our new pipeline molecules while improving our cost structure. As part of the plan, we stated that we would reduce our staff by 3,500 to 4,000 by the end of 2015, close our facilities in Washington state and Colorado and reduce the number of buildings at our headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California.We continue to estimate that these actions will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $935 million to $1,035 million, of which $650 million has been incurred through March 31, 2015. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we incurred $92 million of restructuring costs. We expect that substantially all remaining restructuring actions and related estimated costs will be incurred during the remainder of 2015 to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts.Net savings are not expected to be significant in 2015 due to investments in new product launches and external business development.Additional disclosure information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Note 2, Restructuring, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 20.5% of total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2015, driven primarily by a $99-million charge in the prior year related to the termination of the supply contract with Roche as a result of acquiring the licenses to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective January 1, 2014. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 18.7% and 22.1% of total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2015, and 2014, respectively. See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe decrease in R&D expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2015, was driven by decreased costs associated with Discovery Research and Translational Sciences, marketed products support and later stage clinical programs support of $87 million, $24 million and $22 million, respectively. All categories of R&D spend benefited from savings from transformation and process improvement efforts under our restructuring plan. In 2015, these savings are expected to be offset by investments in support of our launch products as well as reinvestment in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences.Selling, general and administrativeThe increase in SG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2015 was due to increased expenses in preparation for new product launches, offset partially by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts under our restructuring plan.27OtherOther operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2015, included certain charges related to our restructuring plan, primarily severance, of $57 million.Other operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2014, included certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives, primarily severance, of $15 million.Non-operating expenses/income and income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended  March 31,  2015 2014Interest expense, net $252 $259Interest and other income, net $106 $99Provision for income taxes $253 $131Effective tax rate 13.5% 10.9%Interest expense, netThe decrease in interest expense, net for the three months ended March 31, 2015, was due primarily to a lower average outstanding debt balance in the current year period.Interest and other income, netThe increase in interest and other income, net for the three months ended March 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher interest income as a result of higher average cash balances substantially offset by net losses on investments recognized in the current year period. Income taxesOur effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2015 was 13.5% compared with 10.9% for the corresponding period of the prior year. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2015, was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses, offset partially by a state tax audit settlement in the three months ended March 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2015, would have been 17.1% compared with 15.4% for the corresponding period of the prior year.See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$27,118 $27,026Total assets$68,952 $69,009Current portion of long-term debt$500 $500Long-term debt$29,841 $30,215Stockholders’ equity$26,506 $25,778The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and share repurchases, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends and the size of any dividend could be affected by a number of factors. See our Annual 28Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Item 1A. Risk Factors—There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or that we will repurchase stock. In December 2014, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.79 per share of common stock, which was paid on March 6, 2015. In March 2015, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.79 per share of common stock, which will be paid on June 5, 2015.The Company also returns capital to stockholders through its stock repurchase program. Repurchase activity under the program was temporarily suspended from the second quarter of 2013 through the third quarter of 2014, and we reinitiated repurchase activity during the fourth quarter of 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, we repurchased $451 million of stock (cash settlement of stock repurchases totaled $464 million). As of March 31, 2015, $3.4 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $258 million and $223 million, respectively. Of these receivables, $152 million and $124 million were past due as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary.Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaling $27.1 billion as of March 31, 2015, approximately $24.6 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan Credit Facility each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of March 31, 2015. 29Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Three months ended March 31, 2015 2014Net cash provided by operating activities$1,329 $1,142Net cash used in investing activities$(952) $(765)Net cash used in financing activities$(1,244) $(495)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2015, benefited from an improvement in our operating margin, offset partially by the timing of payments to vendors and receipts from customers, including the impact of $100 million received under a government-funded program in Spain during the prior year period.InvestingCash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2015, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $731 million and capital expenditures of $118 million. Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2014, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities and restricted investments of $445 million, capital expenditures of $172 million and cash paid for acquisition of companies of $104 million. Capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in various locations, as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2015 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $800 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2015, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $599 million, repurchases of common stock of $464 million, and the settlement of an obligation incurred in the connection with the acquisition of Onyx of $225 million. Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2014, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $460 million and the repayment of long-term debt of $125 million.See Note 8, Financing arrangements, and Note 9, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2015.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, and is incorporated herein by reference. There have been no material changes during the three months ended March 31, 2015, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.30Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2015.Management determined that, as of March 31, 2015, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 12, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2015, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, provide additional disclosure and context for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we can manufacture, market and sell our products. The approval of our product candidates will depend on the assessment by such regulatory authorities of the benefit-risk profile reflected by the totality of the efficacy and safety information available for our product candidates. Decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling, ingredients and other matters could adversely affect the approval and availability of our products. For example, we are currently investigating brodalumab as a treatment for a variety of inflammatory diseases. On March 23, 2015, we presented data from three phase 3 clinical trials evaluating brodalumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. In connection with that presentation, we noted that we have seen suicidal ideation and completed suicides in our brodalumab program but that we believe the evidence to date does not suggest a causal association between IL-17 inhibition and suicidal ideation and behavior. Full data have been provided to regulatory authorities. We will be discussing these data with regulators, and such data will be an important focus in their analysis of the risk-benefit profile during the regulatory review of our approval applications we plan to file for brodalumab. While we believe that brodalumab has a favorable benefit-risk profile, regulatory authorities will make the 31approval determination and there can be no assurance that brodalumab or any of our late-stage pipeline products will receive regulatory approval.We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars.On March 6, 2015, Sandoz, a Novartis company, announced that the FDA approved its biosimilar filgrastim Zarxio™ for all indications included in the reference product’s (NEUPOGEN®) label.We are increasingly subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.We continue to expand internationally and derive an increasing percentage of our revenues from markets outside the United States. As a result, we are increasingly subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings.Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSDuring the three months ended March 31, 2015, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program.
