For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016.Products/PipelineBone HealthRomosozumab•In July 2016, we and UCB, our collaboration partner in the development of romosozumab, announced that we submitted a BLA to the FDA for romosozumab, an investigational monoclonal antibody for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. The BLA is based on data from the phase 3 placebo-controlled FRAME (FRActure study in postemenopausal woMen with ostEoporosis) study.CardiovascularRepatha®(evolocumab)•In July 2016, we announced that the FDA approved the Repatha® Pushtronex™ system (on-body infusor with prefilled cartridge), a new, monthly single-dose administration option. The Pushtronex™ system is a hands-free device designed to provide 420 mg of Repatha® in a single dose.Oncology/HematologyBLINCYTO®(blinatumomab)•In May 2016, we announced that the FDA accepted for priority review the supplemental BLA for BLINCYTO® to include new data supporting the treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The FDA has set a September 1, 2016, Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date as a goal for the completion of their review of our application.KYPROLIS®(carfilzomib)•In June 2016, the European Commission (EC) approved a variation to the marketing authorization for KYPROLIS® to include use in combination with dexamethasone alone for adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. The EC approved the extended indication for KYPROLIS® based on data from the phase 3 head-to-head ENDEAVOR (RandomizEd, OpeN Label, Phase 3 Study of Carfilzomib Plus DExamethAsone Vs Bortezomib Plus DexamethasOne in Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma) study.NeuroscienceErenumab (formerly AMG 334)•In June 2016, we announced that the global phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of erenumab in chronic migraine prevention met its primary endpoint. Erenumab is being developed jointly with Novartis AG.BiosimilarsABP 501•In July 2016, the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee voted unanimously to recommend approval of our biosimilar candidate ABP 501 in all available indications of the reference product, HUMIRA® (adalimumab). FDA advisory committees review marketed and investigational human drug products, including safety and effectiveness data, and make recommendations to the FDA. These committees are advisory and FDA officials are not bound to or limited by its recommendations, although the FDA has commonly followed the recommendation of its advisory panels. The FDA has set a Biosimilar User Fee Act target action date of September 25, 2016, for ABP 501.27ABP 980•In July 2016, we and Allergan plc announced the results from a phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 980 compared with trastuzumab in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive early breast cancer. The results ruled out inferiority compared to trastuzumab but could not rule out superiority based on its primary efficacy endpoint of the difference of the percentage of patients with a pathologic complete response.Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (dollar and share amounts in millions, except per share data): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2016 2015 Change 2016 2015 ChangeProduct sales:           U.S.$4,317 $4,105 5 % $8,436 $7,876 7 %Rest of the world (ROW)1,157 1,120 3 % 2,277 2,223 2 %Total product sales5,474 5,225 5 % 10,713 10,099 6 %Other revenues214 145 48 % 502 304 65 %Total revenues$5,688 $5,370 6 % $11,215 $10,403 8 %Operating expenses$3,308 $3,294 — % $6,433 $6,305 2 %Operating income$2,380 $2,076 15 % $4,782 $4,098 17 %Net income$1,870 $1,653 13 % $3,770 $3,276 15 %Diluted EPS$2.47 $2.15 15 % $4.97 $4.26 17 %Diluted shares756 768 (2)% 759 769 (1)%The increases in global product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, were driven by ENBREL, Prolia®, KYPROLIS® and XGEVA®.The increases in other revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, were driven primarily by upfront payments received for licensing transactions and higher Ibrance® royalty income. We receive an 8% royalty on Ibrance® sales as a result of the Onyx acquisition.The increases in operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, were driven primarily by increased investments in new product launches. All categories of operating expenses benefited from savings resulting from our transformation and process improvement efforts.The increases in net income and diluted EPS for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, were driven by increases in revenues and operating margins.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefits or detriments that such movements have on our international product sales are offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. By hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros, our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts both positive and negative that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income. The net impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates were not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.28Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2016 2015 Change 2016 2015 ChangeENBREL$1,484 $1,348 10 % $2,869 $2,464 16 %Neulasta®1,149 1,158 (1)% 2,332 2,292 2 %Aranesp®504 479 5 % 1,036 959 8 %Prolia® 441 340 30 % 793 612 30 %XGEVA® 381 331 15 % 759 671 13 %Sensipar®/Mimpara®389 344 13 % 756 678 12 %EPOGEN®331 491 (33)% 631 1,025 (38)%NEUPOGEN®196 256 (23)% 409 502 (19)%Other products599 478 25 % 1,128 896 26 %Total product sales$5,474 $5,225 5 % $10,713 $10,099 6 %Future sales of our products are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others.

On December 17, 2014, and November 18, 2015, Apotex and Sandoz, respectively, announced that the FDA had accepted their respective applications for filing under the abbreviated pathway for their pegfilgrastim products that are proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta®. Therefore, we expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on Neulasta® sales. For discussion of ongoing litigation between us and Apotex and Sandoz, see Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.Future Neulasta® sales will also depend in part on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2016 2015 Change  2016 2015 ChangeAranesp® — U.S.$260 $223 17 % $521 $412 26 %Aranesp® — ROW244 256 (5)% 515 547 (6)%Total Aranesp®$504 $479 5 % $1,036 $959 8 %The increases in global Aranesp® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, were driven primarily by higher unit demand, including a shift by some U.S. dialysis customers from EPOGEN® to Aranesp®, offset partially by a decrease in net selling price and unfavorable changes in inventory.Supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the U.K., relating to our European patent for darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp®) expired in June 2016. For further information regarding our patents, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part 1, Item 1.

There is competition in the United States, which has intensified and will continue to have a material adverse impact on EPOGEN® sales. Currently in the United States, EPOGEN® and Aranesp® compete with MIRCERA®, which F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. began selling in October 2014 and, as of May 2015, for which it licensed commercialization rights in the United States to Galenica Group. MIRCERA® competes with Aranesp® in the nephrology setting only. On December 16, 2014, Hospira submitted a BLA to the FDA under the abbreviated pathway for Retacrit™, a proposed biosimilar to EPOGEN®. For discussion of ongoing litigation between us and Hospira, see Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.NEUPOGEN® NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2016 2015 Change 2016 2015 ChangeNEUPOGEN® — U.S.$141 $191 (26)% $291 $372 (22)%NEUPOGEN® — ROW55 65 (15)% 118 130 (9)%Total NEUPOGEN®$196 $256 (23)% $409 $502 (19)%The decreases in global NEUPOGEN® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, were driven primarily by lower unit demand in the United States due to the impact of short-acting competition.There is competition in the United States, which has intensified and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of NEUPOGEN®. On September 3, 2015, Sandoz announced it had launched Zarxio®, a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN®, in the United States. On February 17, 2015, Apotex announced that the FDA had accepted its application for filing under the abbreviated pathway for its proposed biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN®.

As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities to deliver value to patients and stockholders. These efforts include a restructuring, which is also delivering cost savings and funding investments.We continue to estimate that the restructuring will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $800 million to $900 million, of which $684 million was incurred through June 30, 2016. The charges that were recorded related to the restructuring during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, were not significant. We expect that we will incur most of the remaining 32estimated costs in the remainder of 2016 and in 2017 in order to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts.In 2016, we remain on track to deliver an estimated $400 million in incremental benefits from our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts, versus 2015, with half of this savings achieved through June 30, 2016. These savings will enable continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities.Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 18.5% and 18.4% of total revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. The decreases were driven primarily by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling prices.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 16.7% and 16.8% of total revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared with 18.5% and 18.6% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. See Note 4, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe decreases in R&D expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, were driven by savings resulting from transformation and process improvement efforts, a portion of which were reinvested for the long-term benefit of the Company, as well as by lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs.For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, costs associated with our later-stage clinical programs support decreased by $302 million and $566 million, respectively, offset by increased costs in marketed products support of $245 million and $487 million, respectively. Discovery Research and Translational Sciences spend was relatively unchanged for both periods. Prior to approval, costs related to our launch products were categorized largely as later-stage clinical programs.Selling, general and administrativeThe increases in Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, were driven primarily by investments in new product launches. The six months ended June 30, 2016, were also impacted by a $73 million charge related to an acquisition. Both periods benefited from transformation and process improvement efforts.OtherOther operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, included legal proceeding charges of $78 million and $105 million, respectively.Other operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, included a legal proceeding charge of $71 million. The six months ended June 30, 2015, also included $67 million of severance related to our restructuring plan.Non-operating expenses/income and income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended Six months ended June 30, June 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015Interest expense, net$313 $277 $607 $529Interest and other income, net$137 $198 $287 $304Provision for income taxes$334 $344 $692 $597Effective tax rate15.2% 17.2% 15.5% 15.4%Interest expense, netThe increases in Interest expense, net, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, were due primarily to a higher average amount of fixed-rate debt outstanding.Interest and other income, netThe decreases in Interest and other income, net, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, were due primarily to a gain on the sale of strategic investment in the second quarter of 2015, offset partially by higher interest income that resulted from 33higher average cash balances and a slightly higher yield on our debt securities portfolio, net of fees incurred for the debt exchange transaction during the second quarter of 2016.Income taxesThe decrease in our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2016, was due primarily to the favorable tax impact of discrete benefits associated with tax incentives and the adoption of a new accounting standard that amends certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based compensation payments. One aspect of the standard requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as income tax benefits and expenses in the income statement. The decrease was offset partially by the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses.The increase in our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016, was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and by a state tax audit settlement in the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase was offset partially by discrete benefits associated with tax incentives and the adoption of a new accounting standard that amends certain aspects of the accounting for employee share based compensation payments.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, would have been 18.1% and 18.4%, respectively, compared with 20.6% and 18.9% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.See Note 4, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$35,034 $31,382Total assets$75,471 $71,449Current portion of long-term debt$5,294 $2,247Long-term debt$27,928 $29,182Stockholders’ equity$30,133 $28,083We intend to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, in which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. In December 2015 and March 2016, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.00 per share of common stock, which were paid on March 8 and June 8, 2016, respectively. In July 2016, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock, which will be paid on September 8, 2016.We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased $1.3 billion of our stock and paid $1.2 billion in cash during the period. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we repurchased $966 million of our stock and paid $940 million in cash during the period. As of June 30, 2016, $3.6 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively U.S. funds) are adequate to continue meeting our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 34December 31, 2015, Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaling $35.0 billion as of June 30, 2016, approximately $33.2 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan each include a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of June 30, 2016.Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Six months ended June 30, 2016 2015Net cash provided by operating activities$4,592 $4,766Net cash used in investing activities$(5,047) $(3,311)Net cash used in financing activities$(1,059) $(1,391)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016, decreased compared with the same period in the prior year due primarily to the timing of payments to taxing authorities and vendors, as well as the effective termination of foreign currency forward contracts that resulted in the receipt of $247 million of cash in the prior year period, offset partially by improved operating margins.InvestingCash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $4.6 billion and capital expenditures of $344 million. Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2015, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of $3.0 billion and capital expenditures of $251 million, offset partially by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $226 million. Capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in various locations as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2016 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $1.5 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $1.2 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $262 million, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments, of $1.9 billion. Cash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2015, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $1.2 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $940 million, withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $390 million and the settlement of an obligation incurred in connection with the acquisition of Onyx of $225 million, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments, of $1.3 billion.See Note 9, Financing arrangements, and Note 10, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2016.35Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and is incorporated herein by reference. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes during the six months ended June 30, 2016, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsDuring the first quarter of 2016, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the entire principal amount of the debt denominated in euros and Swiss francs that we issued during this period. As of June 30, 2016, we had open cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt securities to U.S. dollars and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of June 30, 2016, would result in a reduction in the aggregate fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $530 million, but would have no material effect on cash flows or income in the ensuing year.Foreign currency sensitive financial instrumentsAs of June 30, 2016, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a carrying value of $5.8 billion and a fair value of $6.4 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to exchange rates as of June 30, 2016, would result in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $1.3 billion and a reduction in income of approximately $1.2 billion but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis for this debt does not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the related cross-currency swap contracts which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt.With regard to our $5.6 billion notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros, pound sterling and Swiss francs, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to exchange rates as of June 30, 2016, would result in a reduction in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $1.3 billion but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The impact on income during this period from the above mentioned hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016.Management determined that, as of June 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.36PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2016, and March 31, 2016, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016, provide additional disclosure for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant disruptions or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials.We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for NEUPOGEN®, Aranesp®, EPOGEN®, Prolia® and XGEVA® and substantially all of the formulation, fill and finish operations for Neulasta® and ENBREL at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. We also currently perform all of the bulk manufacturing for Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN® and Aranesp®, all of the purification of bulk EPOGEN® material and substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for Prolia® and XGEVA® at this facility. We perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill and finish, and packaging for product candidates to be used in clinical trials at our manufacturing facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) Since June 2015, when the Governor of Puerto Rico announced that the government (including certain government entities) is unable to pay its roughly $72 billion in debt, the government’s liquidity position has continued to deteriorate. In early April 2016, the Puerto Rico government enacted the Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Financial Rehabilitation Act (Act No. 21-2016) that authorizes the Governor to declare a fiscal emergency and implement a temporary debt moratorium until January 2017. Pursuant to the new law, the Governor issued an Executive Order that declared a fiscal emergency and implemented the debt moratorium in order to prevent a shutdown of essential government services and manage the government’s cash liquidity. Public reports indicate that the Puerto Rico government is not making certain payments. On June 30, 2016, President Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to provide a mechanism for Puerto Rico to restructure its debt, achieve fiscal responsibility, and gain access to capital markets. PROMESA establishes a federal Financial Oversight and Management Board to assist in the debt restructuring, and establishment of the Board operates as an automatic stay of creditor actions to enforce claims against the Puerto Rico government. While PROMESA is an important step in moving Puerto Rico towards economic stability, there is still a risk that Puerto Rico’s economic situation could impact the territorial government’s provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business, create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, and make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico.37Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSDuring the three months ended June 30, 2016, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program and the repurchase activity was as follows: Total numberof sharespurchased Averageprice paidper share Total number ofshares purchasedas part of publicly announced program Maximum dollarvalue that mayyet be purchasedunder the program(1)April 1 - 30684,708 $159.11 684,708 $4,117,540,621May 1 - 31843,447 $154.05 843,447 $3,987,606,271June 1 - 302,332,541 $151.04 2,332,541 $3,635,289,228 3,860,696 $153.13 3,860,696  (1)In October 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an increase that resulted in a total of $5.0 billion available under the stock repurchase program.Item 6.
