Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7 — Product Sales in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended    March 31,    2014 2013 Change Neulasta®— U.S. $852 $827 3 %Neulasta®— ROW 238 212 12 %Total Neulasta® 1,090 1,039 5 %NEUPOGEN®— U.S. 214 242 (12)%NEUPOGEN®— ROW 75 57 32 %Total NEUPOGEN® 289 299 (3)%Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® $1,379 $1,338 3 %ROW Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® included sales in new markets as a result of reacquiring rights to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective January 1, 2014.The increase in global Neulasta® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2014, was driven mainly by an increase in the average net sales price in the United States, offset partially by lower wholesaler inventory.The decrease in global NEUPOGEN® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2014, was driven by a decrease in unit demand in the United States.Our material U.S. patents for filgrastim (NEUPOGEN®) expired in December 2013. We now face competition in the United States, which may have a material adverse impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN® and, to a lesser extent, Neulasta®.

See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe increase in R&D expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2014, was driven primarily by an increase of $176 million in our later stage clinical programs, including Onyx programs, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support and Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities of $17 million and $10 million, respectively.Selling, general and administrativeThe decrease in SG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2014, was driven primarily by the expiration of the ENBREL profit share in October 2013, which reduced expenses by $220 million. This decline was offset partially by the addition of $57 million as a result of the Onyx acquisition.Other mattersAs discussed previously, we announced top-line results from the primary OS analysis of a phase 3 trial of talimogene laherparepvec in melanoma. We are currently reviewing the results from this study with clinicians, regulators and payers to determine the best course forward. We acquired talimogene laherparepvec in 2011 and have a $675 million IPR&D asset and a contingent consideration liability of $334 million as of March 31, 2014, related to this project.Non-operating expenses/income and income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):  Three months ended  March 31,  2014 2013Interest expense, net $259 $263Interest and other income, net $99 $164Provision (benefit) for income taxes $131 $(91)Effective tax rate 10.9% (6.8)%Interest expense, netThe decrease in interest expense, net for the three months ended March 31, 2014, was due primarily to interest on the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes which were settled in February 2013, offset partially by interest resulting from a higher average debt balance in the current year. Interest and other income, netThe decrease in interest and other income, net for the three months ended March 31, 2014, was due primarily to higher net gains on sales of investments recognized in the prior year. Income taxesOur effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, were 10.9% and (6.8)%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2014, was due primarily to two significant events that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2013. First, we settled our federal income tax examination for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, in which we agreed to certain adjustments and remeasured our UTBs accordingly, resulting in a net tax benefit of $185 million. Second, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, enacted during the first quarter of 2013, reinstated the federal R&D tax credit for 2012 and 2013. Therefore, our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2013, included a benefit of approximately $60 million for the full-year 2012 federal R&D tax credit, recorded as a discrete item in the first quarter of 2013. The federal R&D credit expired as of December 31, 2013 and was not reinstated as of March 31, 2014. Therefore, our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2014, does not include a benefit for the federal R&D tax credit. The increase was offset partially by the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses as a result of higher amortization of acquired intangible assets during the three months ended March 31, 2014.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, would have been 15.4% and (0.8)%, respectively.See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.27Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): March 31, 2014 December 31, 2013Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$19,802 $19,401Restricted investments3,414 3,412 Total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investments$23,216 $22,813Total assets$67,004 $66,125Current portion of long-term debt$2,505 $2,505Long-term debt$29,519 $29,623Stockholders’ equity$22,741 $22,096The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. Whether and when we declare dividends and the size of any dividend could be affected by a number of factors. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Item 1A. Risk Factors — There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.) In December 2013, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.61 per share of common stock, which was paid on March 7, 2014. In March 2014, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.61 per share of common stock which will be paid on June 6, 2014.The Company has also returned capital to stockholders through its stock repurchase program, however we have not made repurchases under this program since the first quarter of 2013. As of March 31, 2014, $1.6 billion remained available under our Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program. While we may repurchase additional shares of our common stock in the future, we do not currently have plans to make any significant repurchases during 2014 and 2015.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate, for the foreseeable future, to satisfy: our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends; and other business initiatives we may strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Item 1A. Risk Factors — Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of March 31, 2014, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $334 million, of which $206 million was past due. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary.Of our total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investments balances totaling $23.2 billion as of March 31, 2014, approximately $20.1 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates.28Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan Credit Facility each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of March 31, 2014.Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Three months ended March 31, 2014 2013Net cash provided by operating activities$1,142 $1,049Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities$(765) $1,809Net cash used in financing activities$(495) $(3,585)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2014, increased due primarily to timing of receipts from customers, including the impact of $100 million received under a government-funded program in Spain, and lower payments to taxing authorities, offset partially by the termination of the supply contract with Roche as well as the timing of payments for sales incentives and to vendors and employees. InvestingCash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2014, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities and restricted investments of $445 million, capital expenditures of $172 million and cash paid for the acquisition of companies of $104 million. Cash provided by investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2013, was due primarily to net sales of marketable securities of $2.0 billion offset partially by capital expenditures of $158 million. Capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Singapore, Ireland and Puerto Rico, as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2014 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $800 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2014, was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $460 million and the repayment of long-term debt of $125 million.Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2013, was due primarily to the cash settlement of the $2.5 billion principal amount of the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes which matured/converted, repurchases of our common stock of $832 million and the payment of dividends of $353 million. See Note 8, Financing arrangements, and Note 9, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2014.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, and is incorporated herein by reference. There have been no material changes during the three months ended March 31, 2014, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.29Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2014.Management determined that, as of March 31, 2014, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 12, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, the primary risks related to our business and periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.There are no material updates from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.Item 6.
