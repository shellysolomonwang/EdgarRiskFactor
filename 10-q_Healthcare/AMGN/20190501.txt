Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in this footnote. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.Our legal proceedings involve various aspects of our business and a variety of claims, some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. In each of the matters described in this filing or in Note 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, in which we could incur a liability, our opponents seek an award of a not-yet-quantified amount of damages or an amount that is not material. In addition, a number of the matters pending against us are at very early stages of the legal process, which in complex proceedings of the sort we face often extend for several years. As a result, none of the matters described in this filing or in Note 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, in which we could incur a liability, have progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or the development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate a range of possible loss, if any, or such amounts are not material. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these matters, an adverse determination in one or more of these matters currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings and other matters are discussed below:Novartis Breach of Contract ActionOn April 4, 2019, Amgen filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Novartis Pharma AG (Novartis) seeking a declaratory judgment that Novartis materially breached two collaboration agreements related to the development and commercialization of Aimovig® (erenumab-aooe) due to Novartis’ affiliate Sandoz Gmbh (Sandoz) entering into a contract manufacturing agreement with Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alder) related to eptinezumab, an expected direct competitor to Aimovig® and entrant in the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-related migraine therapy market. Amgen seeks to terminate its collaboration agreements with Novartis and also seeks damages from Novartis for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation.Also on April 4, 2019, Novartis initiated a separate lawsuit against Amgen in the same court seeking declaratory judgment that Novartis, alternatively, did not materially breach the collaboration agreements or, even if it did breach the collaboration agreements, such breach was not material and has been cured, and that Amgen may not terminate the collaboration agreements. On April 8, 2019, Amgen answered Novartis’ complaint and filed counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that Novartis materially breached the collaboration agreements due to its affiliate Sandoz entering into the contract manufacturing agreement with Alder. In its counterclaim, Amgen seeks to terminate its collaboration agreements with Novartis and also seeks damages from Novartis for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. Sensipar® (cinacalcet) LitigationAmgen Inc. v. Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, et al. (formerly, Amgen Inc. v. Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. et al.) ANDA Patent LitigationOn March 19, 2019, Amgen filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, seeking an order from the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the Delaware District Court) enjoining defendant Piramal Healthcare UK Limited (Piramal) from making, using, selling, offering for sale or importing its generic cinacalcet product. Amgen’s motion follows an announcement that Slate Run Pharmaceuticals LLC (Slate Run), in partnership with Piramal, had begun selling Piramal’s generic cinacalcet product at risk notwithstanding the appeals pending at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Federal Circuit Court). On April 15, 2019, the Delaware District Court signed an order enjoining Piramal and Slate Run from selling their generic cinacalcet product until certain events occur related to a decision by the Federal Circuit Court on the parties’ appeal. The order has no effect on the product that Piramal and Slate Run have already sold to third parties.On March 21, 2019, defendants Sun Pharma Global FZE, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. (collectively, Sun) filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement entered between Amgen and Sun, contending that Sun’s generic cinacalcet product should not be held off the U.S. market. 24On March 26, 2019, the Delaware District Court denied the joint motion for indicative ruling of Watson Laboratories, Inc. and Actavis Pharma, Inc. (collectively, Watson) and Amgen, which had asked the court to vacate its final judgment of noninfringement as to Watson and to enter a proposed consent judgment of infringement and validity of Amgen’s U.S. Patent No. 9,375,405 and an injunction prohibiting the making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell or distributing Watson’s generic cinacalcet product in the United States, or importing Watson’s generic cinacalcet product into the United States, consistent with a confidential settlement agreement entered into by the parties. On April 10, 2019, Amgen filed an appeal to the Federal Circuit Court. On April 29, 2019, the Federal Circuit Court lifted the stay of Amgen’s appeal of the judgment of noninfringement as to Watson and consolidated it with Amgen’s appeal of the Delaware District Court’s denial of the joint motion for indicative ruling.Cipla Ltd. v. Amgen Inc. On March 11, 2019, following an announcement by Cipla Limited and Cipla USA, Inc. (collectively, Cipla) that it had begun selling its generic cinacalcet product in the United States, Amgen filed in the Delaware District Court a counterclaim and related motion for preliminary injunction in Cipla’s lawsuit seeking a declaration that provisions of its February 2018 settlement agreement with Amgen have been triggered by the at-risk launch of a generic cinacalcet product by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Teva), an affiliate of Watson. Amgen’s motion seeks to prohibit Cipla from making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell or distributing its generic cinacalcet product in breach of such settlement agreement. On April 2, 2019, the Delaware District Court held a hearing on Amgen’s motion for preliminary injunction.Sensipar® Antitrust Class ActionsFrom February 21, 2019, to April 10, 2019, four plaintiffs filed putative class action lawsuits against Amgen and various entities affiliated with Teva alleging anticompetitive conduct in connection with settlements between Amgen and manufacturers of generic cinacalcet product. Two of those actions were brought in the Delaware District Court, captioned UFCW Local 1500 Welfare Fund v. Amgen Inc., et al. (February 21, 2019) (Local 1500) and Cesar Castillo, Inc. v. Amgen Inc., et al. (February 26, 2019) (Castillo). The third action was brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the New Jersey District Court), captioned Teamsters Local 237 Welfare Fund, et al. v. Amgen Inc., et al. (March 14, 2019) (Local 237) and the fourth action was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the Eastern Pennsylvania District Court), captioned KPH Healthcare Services, Inc. a/k/a Kinney Drugs, Inc. v. Amgen Inc., et al (April 10, 2019) (KPH). Each of the lawsuits is brought on behalf of a putative class of direct or indirect purchasers of Sensipar® and alleges that the plaintiffs have overpaid for Sensipar® as a result of Amgen’s conduct that allegedly improperly delayed market entry by manufacturers of generic cinacalcet products. The lawsuits focus predominantly on the settlement among Amgen, Watson and Teva of the parties’ patent infringement litigation. Each of the lawsuits seeks, among other things, treble damages, equitable relief and attorneys’ fees and costs. On April 10, 2019, the plaintiff in the KPH lawsuit filed a motion seeking to have the four lawsuits consolidated and designated as a multidistrict litigation (MDL) in the Eastern Pennsylvania District Court, and the plaintiff in the Local 1500 lawsuit filed a motion seeking to have the four lawsuits, along with Cipla Ltd. v. Amgen Inc., consolidated and designated as a MDL in the Delaware District Court. Sanofi / Regeneron Repatha® (evolocumab) Patent LitigationOn February 25, 2019, a jury of the Delaware District Court unanimously upheld the validity of claims 7 and 15 of U.S. Patent No. 8,829,165 (the ’165 Patent) and claim 7 of U.S. Patent No. 8,859,741 (the ’741 Patent) in our infringement action against Sanofi, Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC and Aventisub LLC, formerly doing business as Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (collectively, Sanofi) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron). The jury also found that claims 19 and 29 of the ’165 Patent meet the enablement requirement, but are invalid for failure to meet the written description requirement. On March 18, 2019, Sanofi and Regeneron filed post-trial motions seeking to reverse judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial with respect to claims 7 and 15 of the ’165 Patent and claim 7 of the ’741 Patent, and Amgen filed a motion for a permanent injunction. The Delaware District Court has scheduled hearing dates on Amgen’s motion for a permanent injunction for June 6, 13 and 21, 2019.KYPROLIS® (carfilzomib) ANDA Patent LitigationOn March 4, 2019, the Delaware District Court entered an order on a stipulation between Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. and Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Breckenridge), providing that Breckenridge infringes the asserted claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,417,042; 7,737,112 and 8,207,125, and consolidated this lawsuit against Breckenridge into the existing consolidated case, Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. v. Cipla Limited, et al., for all purposes. Trial in the consolidated case is scheduled to commence on May 6, 2019. 25Bioepis ENBREL (etanercept) Patent LitigationOn April 30, 2019, Immunex Corporation and Amgen Manufacturing, Limited (collectively, Amgen), along with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (Roche), filed a lawsuit in the New Jersey District Court against Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. (Bioepis). This lawsuit stems from Bioepis’s submission of an application for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure of an etanercept product as biosimilar to Amgen’s ENBREL. Amgen and Roche have asserted infringement of five patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,063,182 (the ’182 Patent); 8,163,522 (the ’522 Patent); 7,915,225 (the ’225 Patent); 8,119,605 (the ’605 Patent); and 8,722,631 (the ’631 Patent). By their complaint, Amgen and Roche seek an injunction to prohibit Bioepis from commercializing its biosimilar etanercept product in the United States prior to the expiry of such patents.NEUPOGEN® (filgrastim) / Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) Patent LitigationApotex NEUPOGEN® / Neulasta® Patent LitigationOn April 5, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the Florida District Court) denied the motion of Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corporation (collectively, Apotex) to dismiss Amgen’s complaint for failure to state a claim. On April 18, 2019, Apotex answered the complaint including counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments of noninfringement and invalidity.Coherus Neulasta® Patent LitigationA hearing on Amgen’s Federal Circuit Court appeal of the final judgment dismissing Amgen’s lawsuit against Coherus BioSciences, Inc. (Coherus) for infringement of Amgen’s U.S. Patent No. 8,273,707 is scheduled for May 8, 2019. As previously disclosed, we are also engaged in a separate lawsuit in the Ventura County Superior Court in which we have alleged that Coherus and others misappropriated our confidential information and trade secrets through the hiring of former Amgen employees and that the defendants have used such information to develop and market UDENYCATM, as biosimilar to Amgen’s Neulasta®. On March 27, 2019, the Ventura County Superior Court ordered Howard Weiser dismissed from the lawsuit based on a joint request regarding settlement filed on behalf of Amgen and Mr. Weiser. Trial in the misappropriation and trade secret litigation began on April 22, 2019.Pfizer NEUPOGEN® Patent LitigationOn March 22, 2019, Amgen filed an amended complaint against Pfizer Inc. and Hospira Inc. (collectively, Pfizer) in the Delaware District Court narrowing the patent claims at issue in the infringement dispute and adding a request for damages. On April 11, 2019, Pfizer answered Amgen’s amended complaint including counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments of noninfringement and invalidity. Sandoz NEUPOGEN® / Neulasta® Patent LitigationOn February 21, 2019, Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz) filed a new lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the California Northern District Court) against Amgen Inc. and Amgen Manufacturing, Limited seeking a judgment of noninfringement and invalidity of the ’997 Patent. The lawsuit stems from Sandoz filing applications under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act for the FDA licensure of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim products as biosimilar to NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta®, respectively. On April 24, 2019, Amgen filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit for failure to state a claim. Patent Trial and Appeal Board Patent ChallengesOn March 7, 2019, Kashiv Biosciences, LLC, formerly known as Adello Biologics, LLC (Kashiv), filed petitions seeking to institute inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) to challenge the patentability of each claim of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,940,878 (the ’878 Patent) and 9,643,997 (the ’997 Patent). The ’878 Patent is also among the patents at issue in the previously-disclosed litigation between Amgen Inc. and Amgen Manufacturing, Limited (collectively, Amgen) and Kashiv, Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, and Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Kashiv NEUPOGEN® litigation) and in the previously-disclosed litigations between Amgen and Sandoz Inc., Sandoz International GmbH and Sandoz GmbH (the Sandoz NEUPOGEN® litigation) and between Amgen and Sandoz Inc., Sandoz International GmbH, Sandoz GmbH and Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d. (the Sandoz Neulasta® litigation). The ’997 Patent is also among the patents at issue in the Kashiv NEUPOGEN® litigation, the Pfizer NEUPOGEN® Patent Litigation, the new Sandoz NEUPOGEN® / Neulasta® Patent Litigation and the previously-disclosed litigation between Amgen and Mylan Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc., Mylan GmbH, and Mylan N.V. The deadline for Amgen to file a preliminary response to these IPR petitions is June 14, 2019, after which the PTAB will have three months to render a decision regarding whether to institute PTAB trial proceedings on the ’878 and ’997 Patents.26In a separate challenge, on April 14, 2019, Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC and Fresenius Kabi SwissBiosim GmbH filed a petition seeking to institute IPR proceedings before the PTAB to challenge the patentability of U.S. Patent No. 9,856,287 (the ’287 Patent). The ’287 Patent is also the subject of the Apotex NEUPOGEN® / Neulasta® Patent Litigation and is among the patents at issue in the Kashiv NEUPOGEN® litigation. The patent owner preliminary response to the IPR petition is due July 17, 2019, after which the PTAB will have three months to render a decision regarding whether to institute PTAB trial proceedings on the ’287 Patent. In a separate challenge, on April 19, 2019, the PTAB granted Apotex and Kashiv’s previously-disclosed petition to institute post grant review proceedings on the ’287 Patent, challenging claims of the ’287 Patent as unpatentable. Amgen’s response to the petition is due July 11, 2019. AMJEVITATM (adalimumab-atto) / AMGEVITATM Patent LitigationOn April 18, 2019, Amgen responded to the lawsuit filed by Coherus, denying patent infringement and seeking judgment that the patents-in-suit are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed by Amgen. MVASITM (bevacizumab-awwb) Patent LitigationOn March 29, 2019, Genentech, Inc. (Genentech) and City of Hope filed a third lawsuit against Amgen in the Delaware District Court alleging infringement of 14 patents. All but 2 of the 14 patents asserted in this lawsuit have already been the subject of litigation pending among these parties in this court relating to Amgen’s submission of the application that led to the FDA licensure of MVASITM as biosimilar to Genentech’s Avastin® (bevacizumab). Among other remedies, Genentech and City of Hope are seeking injunctive relief. Humira® Biosimilar Antitrust Class ActionsFrom March 18, 2019, to April 19, 2019, ten purported class actions against Amgen, along with AbbVie Inc. and AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd. (collectively, AbbVie), were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The cases are captioned: UFCW Local 1500 Welfare Fund v. AbbVie Inc., et al. (March 18, 2019) (Local 1500); Fraternal Order of Police, Miami Lodge 20, Insurance Trust Fund v. AbbVie Inc., et al. (March 20, 2019); Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. AbbVie Inc., et al. (March 22, 2019); Pipe Trades Services MN Welfare Fund v. AbbVie Inc., et al. (March 29, 2019); St. Paul Electrical Workers’ Health Plan v. AbbVie Inc., et al. (March 29, 2019); Welfare Plan of the International Union of Operating Engineers Locals 137, 137A, 137B, 137C, and 137R v. AbbVie Inc., et al. (April 1, 2019); Law Enforcement Health Benefits, Inc. v. AbbVie, Inc., et al. (April 9, 2019) (Law Enforcement); Kentucky Laborers District Council Health and Welfare Fund v. AbbVie, Inc., et al. (April 16, 2019); Sheet Metal Workers’ Local Union No. 28 Welfare Fund v. AbbVie, Inc., et al. (April 19, 2019) (Sheet Metal Workers’); and Locals 302 & 612 of The International Union of Operating Engineers-Employers Construction Industry Health And Security Trust Fund v. AbbVie Inc., et al. (April 25, 2019) (Construction Industry) (collectively, Humira® Antitrust Class Actions). In each of the Humira® Antitrust Class Actions, the plaintiffs bring federal antitrust claims along with various state law claims under state common law and state antitrust, consumer protection, and unfair competition statutes. In each case, the plaintiffs specifically allege that AbbVie has unlawfully monopolized the alleged market for Humira® and biosimilars of Humira®, including by creating an allegedly unlawful so-called patent thicket around Humira®. In the Local 1500, Sheet Metal Workers’ and Construction Industry cases, the plaintiffs further allege that AbbVie entered into allegedly unlawful market division agreements with Amgen and other companies that had developed Humira® biosimilars, including Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd., Mylan Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sandoz, Inc., Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC, Pfizer Inc. and Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in connection with the settlement of patent litigation relating to Humira®, whereby Amgen and the other defendants that have developed Humira® biosimilars were permitted to market those products in Europe as early as October 2018, while remaining off the market in the United States until 2023. In each of the Humira® Antitrust Class Actions other than the Local 1500 and Construction Industry cases, the plaintiffs allege that AbbVie and Amgen entered into an allegedly unlawful settlement agreement under which Amgen allegedly agreed to delay its entry into the U.S. market with AMGEVITATM, its Humira® biosimilar, in exchange for an alleged promise of exclusivity as the sole Humira® biosimilar in that market for five months, beginning in January 2023. In each of the Humira® Antitrust Class Actions, plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, treble damages and attorney’s fees on behalf of a putative class of third-party payers and/or consumers that have indirectly purchased, paid for or provided reimbursement for Humira® in the United States. Defendants’ responses to the first six complaints were stayed by the court and a status hearing is set for May 2, 2019.U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts-Patient Assistance InvestigationOn April 25, 2019, Amgen, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services entered into a settlement agreement. Under that agreement, Amgen agreed to pay $24.75 million to resolve the government’s allegations relating to Amgen’s support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access their medicines. Additionally, Amgen and OIG entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement that requires Amgen to maintain its corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years.27Item 2.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business.

For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Products/Pipeline CardiovascularRepatha®  •In February 2019, we announced that a jury unanimously upheld the validity of two of our patents related to Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) antibodies in our infringement action against Sanofi, Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, Aventisub LLC and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. See Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 28Bone healthEVENITYTM  •In April 2019, we and UCB, our global collaboration partner in the development of EVENITYTM, announced that the FDA approved EVENITYTM for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture. Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data): Three months endedMarch 31,   2019 2018 ChangeProduct sales     U.S.$3,991 $4,147 (4)%ROW1,295 1,196 8 %Total product sales5,286 5,343 (1)%Other revenues271 211 28 %Total revenues$5,557 $5,554 — %Operating expenses$3,085 $2,828 9 %Operating income$2,472 $2,726 (9)%Net income$1,992 $2,311 (14)%Diluted EPS$3.18 $3.25 (2)%Diluted shares626 711 (12)%In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers (such as physicians or their clinics), dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held by wholesaler customers and end users (such as pharmacies).Total product sales decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2019, driven primarily by a decline in net selling price and unfavorable changes in inventory, offset partially by higher unit demand. In 2019, we expect a lower net selling price compared with 2018. Other revenues increased for the three months ended March 31, 2019, driven primarily by higher royalties. Operating expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2019, driven primarily by higher Cost of sales and R&D expense. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.29Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2019 2018 ChangeENBREL$1,151 $1,105 4 %Neulasta®1,021 1,155 (12)%Prolia® 592 494 20 %XGEVA® 471 445 6 %Aranesp®414 454 (9)%KYPROLIS®245 222 10 %EPOGEN®219 244 (10)%Sensipar®/Mimpara®213 497 (57)%Other products960 727 32 %Total product sales$5,286 $5,343 (1)%Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed below and in the following sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018: (i) Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products, (ii) Item 1A. Risk Factors and (iii) Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview, and Results of Operations—Product Sales.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2019 2018 ChangeENBREL — U.S.$1,106 $1,050 5 %ENBREL — Canada45 55 (18)%Total ENBREL$1,151 $1,105 4 %The increase in ENBREL sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was driven primarily by favorable impacts from changes in accounting estimates of sales deductions and product returns and a slight increase in net selling price, offset partially by unfavorable changes in inventory. In 2019, we expect lower unit demand compared with 2018. In April 2019, the FDA approved a second biosimilar version of ENBREL. Other companies are also developing proposed biosimilar versions of ENBREL. Further, we are involved in patent litigations with the two companies seeking to market their FDA-approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL. See Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. These companies may seek to enter the U.S. market if we are not successful in our litigations, or even earlier.30Neulasta® Total Neulasta® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2019 2018 ChangeNeulasta®— U.S.$893 $1,009 (11)%Neulasta®— ROW128 146 (12)%Total Neulasta®$1,021 $1,155 (12)%The decrease in global Neulasta® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was driven primarily by lower net selling price and, to a lesser extent, changes in inventory. Neulasta® sales in 2019 included a $98 million order from the U.S. government.Our final material U.S. patent for Neulasta® expired in October 2015. Therefore, we face increased competition in the United States, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of Neulasta®. Biosimilar versions of Neulasta® have been approved and launched and other biosimilar versions may also receive approval in the near future. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigations with these and other companies that are developing proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta®, see Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.In addition, supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, that are related to our European patent for Neulasta® expired in August 2017. In 2019, we expect European sales to decline with the launch of multiple long-acting biosimilar competitors.Neulasta® sales have been and will continue to be affected by the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new treatment alternatives, including those that have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of myelosuppressive regimens in some patients.Prolia® Total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2019 2018 ChangeProlia® — U.S.$390 $320 22%Prolia® — ROW202 174 16%Total Prolia®$592 $494 20%The increase in global Prolia® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was driven primarily by higher unit demand. Prolia®, which has a six-month dosing interval, has exhibited a historical sales pattern, with the first and third quarters of a year representing lower sales than the second and fourth quarters of a year. XGEVA®  Total XGEVA® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2019 2018 ChangeXGEVA® — U.S.$356 $332 7%XGEVA® — ROW115 113 2%Total XGEVA®$471 $445 6%The increase in global XGEVA® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was driven primarily by higher unit demand.31Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2019 2018 ChangeAranesp® — U.S.$182 $225 (19)%Aranesp® — ROW232 229 1 %Total Aranesp®$414 $454 (9)%The decrease in global Aranesp® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was driven primarily by the impact of competition on unit demand. Aranesp® faces competition from a long-acting product. Aranesp® also faces competition from a biosimilar version of EPOGEN®, which was approved in the second quarter of 2018 and launched in the fourth quarter of 2018. Other biosimilar versions of EPOGEN ® may also receive approval. In 2019, we expect sales in the United States to decline at a faster rate than in 2018 due to short- and long- acting competition. KYPROLIS® Total KYPROLIS® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2019 2018 ChangeKYPROLIS® — U.S.$154 $137 12%KYPROLIS® — ROW91 85 7%Total KYPROLIS®$245 $222 10%The increase in global KYPROLIS® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was driven primarily by higher unit demand.We are engaged in litigation with a number of companies challenging our material patents relating to KYPROLIS® and seeking to market generic carfilzomib products, one of which has been tentatively approved by the FDA. See Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements. These companies may seek to enter the U.S. market at risk as soon as their products are approved by the FDA, which could occur following the expiry of the stay of regulatory approval under the Hatch-Waxman Act that currently prevents the FDA from granting final approval before January 2020. EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2019 2018 ChangeEPOGEN® — U.S.$219 $244 (10)%The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was driven primarily by a decline in net selling price due to our contract with DaVita Inc. In 2019, we expect a lower net selling price compared with 2018.  Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN® expired in May 2015. We face competition in the United States, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of EPOGEN®. Multiple companies are developing proposed biosimilar versions of EPOGEN®. A biosimilar version of EPOGEN® was approved in the second quarter of 2018 and launched in the fourth quarter of 2018. Other biosimilar versions of EPOGEN® may also receive approval. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigation with one of these companies, see Note 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.32Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31,   2019 2018 ChangeSensipar® — U.S.$135 $409 (67)%Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW78 88 (11)%Total Sensipar®/Mimpara®$213 $497 (57)%The decrease in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was driven primarily by the impact of at-risk launches by generic competitors and, to a lesser extent, changes in inventory. Our U.S. composition-of-matter patent related to Sensipar®, a small molecule, expired in March 2018. We are involved in litigation with a number of companies seeking to market generic cinacalcet products surrounding our U.S. formulation patent that expires in September 2026. See Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain manufacturers of generics began selling their products in the United States in late 2018 and early 2019, and some of this generic product remains commercially available in the United States from third-party distributors. We believe our product sales for Sensipar® have already been and may continue to be adversely impacted as a result of generic product sales in the U.S. market. In 2019, we expect Sensipar® sales will be lower than in 2018 due to existing and potential future generic-market entries, continued adoption of Parsabiv® and higher purchases in 2018 due to the reimbursement change from Medicare Part D to Part B.

In 2019, product mix will continue to negatively impact cost of sales. Research and developmentThe increase in R&D expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was driven primarily by increased spending in research and early pipeline in support of our oncology programs, as changes in late-stage programs and marketed products were not significant. Selling, general and administrativeThe increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was driven primarily by investments in launch products.OtherOther operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, remained flat and included changes in the fair values of contingent consideration and certain net charges related to our restructuring plan.Nonoperating expense/income and income taxesNonoperating expense/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months endedMarch 31, 2019 2018Interest expense, net$343 $338Interest and other income, net$185 $231Provision for income taxes$322 $308Effective tax rate13.9% 11.8%Interest expense, netThe increase in Interest expense, net, for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was due primarily to the impact of rising interest rates on variable-rate debt, offset by a reduction in average debt outstanding.34Interest and other income, netThe decrease in Interest and other income, net, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was due primarily to the net gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of Kirin-Amgen, Inc., during the three months ended March 31, 2018 as well as reduced interest income as a result of lower average cash and marketable securities balances, offset partially by lower losses on sales of investments.Income taxesThe increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was due primarily to a prior-year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under U.S. corporate tax reform.As previously disclosed, we received a RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In November 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRS’s calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. If we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months and could have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$26,301 $29,304Total assets$63,997 $66,416Current portion of long-term debt$3,705 $4,419Long-term debt$29,319 $29,510Stockholders’ equity$10,832 $12,500Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesWe have global access to our $26.3 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as we no longer reinvest the related undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely outside the United States. As a result of U.S. corporate tax reform in 2017, we recorded a repatriation tax liability on undistributed earnings generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions, which will be paid over eight years. The first two annual payments were made in April 2018 and April 2019, and the remaining scheduled payments total $6.2 billion. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Capital allocationConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we seek to deploy our accumulated cash balances in an efficient manner, and we consider several alternatives such as payment of dividends, stock repurchases, repayment of debt and strategic transactions that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest.We intend to continue to invest in our business while returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or 35stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the Company’s agreements. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.In December 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.45 per share of common stock, an increase of 10% from the cash dividend paid in each of the previous four quarters, which was paid on March 8, 2019. In March 2019, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.45 per share of common stock, which will be paid on June 7, 2019. We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we repurchased $3.0 billion of common stock. As of March 31, 2019, $2.1 billion of authority remained available under our stock repurchase program.As a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Our accumulated deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Certain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant, which requires that we maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA) to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the credit agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of March 31, 2019.Cash flowsOur summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): Three months endedMarch 31, 2019 2018Net cash provided by operating activities$1,845 $2,727Net cash provided by investing activities$3,555 $14,906Net cash used in financing activities$(4,987) $(11,692)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2019, decreased compared with the same period in the prior year due primarily to an increase in sales deductions paid to customers and lower net income. InvestingCash provided by investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, was due primarily to net cash inflows related to marketable securities of $3.7 billion and $14.9 billion, respectively. Higher cash inflows in the prior year reflects the cash to fund a $10.0 billion tender offer completed in 2018 to repurchase our common stock. Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with site development costs, including our Thousand Oaks, California, campus, as well as the next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Rhode Island and life cycle investments across the manufacturing network during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were $116 million and $155 million, respectively. We currently estimate 2019 spending on capital projects to be approximately $700 million.36FinancingCash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2019, was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $3.0 billion, repayment of debt of $1.0 billion and the payment of dividends of $0.9 billion. Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2018, was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $10.7 billion and the payment of dividends of $1.0 billion. See Note 9, Financing arrangements, and Note 10, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2019.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and is incorporated herein by reference. There have been no material changes during the three months ended March 31, 2019, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2019.Management determined that, as of March 31, 2019, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.37PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2019, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.There are no material updates from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
