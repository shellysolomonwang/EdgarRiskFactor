The increase in global Neulasta® sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, was driven by an increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by a decline in units.The increases in global NEUPOGEN® sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, were driven by a $155-million order from the U.S. government. Excluding the special order, sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, reflected decreases in unit demand, offset partially by increases in the average net sales price.Our outstanding material U.S. patents for filgrastim (NEUPOGEN®) expire in December 2013. We expect to face competition in the United States beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, which may have a material adverse impact over time on sales of NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta®. 26ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2013 2012 Change  2013 2012 Change ENBREL — U.S.$1,073 $1,012 6% $3,136 $2,881 9%ENBREL — Canada82 67 22% 215 194 11%Total ENBREL$1,155 $1,079 7% $3,351 $3,075 9%The increases in ENBREL sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, were driven primarily by increases in the average net sales price, offset partially by slight unit declines.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2013 2012 Change  2013 2012 Change Aranesp® — U.S.$171 $178 (4)% $567 $595 (5)%Aranesp® — ROW278 319 (13)% 874 956 (9)%Total Aranesp®$449 $497 (10)% $1,441 $1,551 (7)%The decreases in global Aranesp® sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, were driven by a decline in units and we expect sales to continue trending slightly downward.EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Nine months ended   September 30,   September 30,   2013 2012 Change  2013 2012 Change EPOGEN® — U.S.$491 $491 —% $1,428 $1,462 (2)%EPOGEN® sales for the three months ended September 30, 2013, were flat.

The excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico also slightly contributed to the decreases as the tax rate declined from 4.0% in 2011 to 3.75% in 2012 and 2.75% in 2013. However, changes to the law have increased the rate effective July 1, 2013, back to 4.0%.Excluding the impact of the excise tax, cost of sales would have been 15.0% and 15.4% of product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared with 16.4% and 16.5% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe increase in R&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2013, was driven primarily by increased costs associated with supporting later-stage clinical programs of $133 million, particularly evolocumab and the $50 million upfront payment to Servier for the U.S. rights to ivabradine. These expenses were offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $24 million. Expenses related to Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities were flat compared with the prior year.The increase in R&D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, was driven primarily by increased costs associated with supporting later-stage clinical programs of $364 million, including evolocumab, and increases in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities of $65 million. These expenses were offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $37 million.Selling, general and administrativeThe increases in SG&A expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, were driven by higher ENBREL profit share expenses of $46 million and $154 million, respectively; as well as $39 million and $88 million, respectively, related primarily to favorable changes to the estimated U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee in the prior year.Under our ENBREL collaboration agreement, we currently pay Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada attributable to all approved indications for ENBREL on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, we maintain a majority share of ENBREL profits. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share were $432 million and $1,235 million, respectively, compared with $386 million and $1,081 million for the corresponding periods of the prior year. After expiration of the co-promotion term on October 31, 2013, we will be required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net Enbrel sales in the United States and Canada of 12% through October 31, 2014, 11% through October 31, 2015 and 10% through October 31, 2016.OtherOther operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, included certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives, primarily severance, of $35 million and $46 million, respectively.29Based on analysis of the results from the phase 3 trial for talimogene laherparepvec in melanoma, which met its primary endpoint, there were increases in management's estimates of the probabilities of completing the BLA filing and receiving approval to market talimogene laherparepvec in specified patient populations in the United States and the EU. Due primarily to these changes in key assumptions, the estimated aggregate fair value of the contingent consideration obligations increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, by $111 million and was recorded in Other operating expenses.Other operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, included certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives of $36 million and $106 million, due primarily to lease abandonment expenses, and legal proceedings charges of $53 million and $65 million, respectively.Non-operating expenses/income and income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012Interest expense, net$257 $271 $761 $762Interest and other income, net$72 $111 $332 $359Provision for income taxes$135 $156 $191 $529Effective tax rate9.0% 12.4% 4.5% 12.9%Interest expense, netThe decrease in interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2013, was due primarily to the settlement of the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes in February 2013, offset partially by financing fees paid in association with the acquisition of Onyx. Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, was essentially flat as the decrease resulting from the settlement of our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes was offset by increases resulting from the higher average debt balance on other outstanding debt and financing fees paid in association with the acquisition of Onyx.Interest and other income, netThe decrease in interest and other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2013, was due primarily to higher net gains on sales of investments recognized in the prior year and lower portfolio investment returns. The decrease in interest and other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, was due primarily to higher net gains on sales of investments recognized in the prior year.Income taxesOur effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, were 9.0% and 4.5%, respectively, compared with 12.4% and 12.9% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2013, was due primarily to the current year reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit and changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses in 2013.For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, the effective tax rate was reduced by two significant events that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2013. First, the rate was reduced by the federal and state tax impacts of the settlement of our examination with the IRS related to years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The settlement resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately $185 million. Second, the rate was reduced by the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2012 and 2013. The retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit for 2012 resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately $60 million.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, would have been 13.8% and 9.8%, respectively, compared with 17.7% and 18.3% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.30Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$22,558 $24,061Receivable from sale of investments560 —Restricted investments3,411 —Total assets57,073 54,298Current portion of long-term debt11 2,495Long-term debt27,178 24,034Stockholders’ equity21,728 19,060The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. Whether and when we declare dividends and the size of any dividend could be affected by a number of factors. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, Item 1A. Risk Factors—There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.) In December 2012, March 2013 and July 2013, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.47 per share of common stock, which were paid on March 7, June 7 and September 6, 2013, respectively. On October 16, 2013, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per share of common stock, which will be paid on December 6, 2013. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we repurchased 9.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $771 million at an average price of $85.03 per share. As of September 30, 2013, $1.6 billion remained available under our stock repurchase program; however, we do not expect to make any significant repurchases of our common stock during the remainder of 2013, 2014 and 2015.We entered into a Repurchase Agreement pursuant to which Amgen sold 34,097 Class A preferred shares of one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, ATL Holdings, to a counterparty on September 30, 2013. Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, we are obligated to repurchase the Class A preferred shares from the counterparty on or before September 28, 2018, for the aggregate sale price of $3.1 billion. Under the Repurchase Agreement, which is accounted for as long-term debt, we are obligated to make payments to the counterparty based on the sale price of the outstanding preferred shares at a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.1%. On October 1, 2013, we borrowed $5.0 billion under a Term Loan Credit Facility which bears interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus additional interest, initially 1%, which can vary based on the credit ratings assigned to our long-term debt by S&P and Moody’s. A portion of the principal amount of this debt is to be repaid at the end of each quarter equal to 2.5% of the original amount of the loan, or $125 million, with the balance due on October 1, 2018. This credit facility includes the same financial covenant as our revolving credit facility with respect to our level of borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. For a discussion of the Repurchase Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Facility, see Note 7, Financing arrangements to the condensed consolidated financial statements.The $8.1 billion of proceeds received under the Repurchase Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Facility and additional available cash was used to purchase Onyx on October 1, 2013. See Note 12, Subsequent event to the condensed consolidated financial statements.In February 2013, our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes matured/converted, and accordingly, the $2.5 billion principal amount was settled in cash. We also elected to pay the note holders who converted their notes $99 million of cash for the excess conversion value, as allowed under the original terms of the notes, which was offset by our receipt of the same amount of cash from the counterparty to the related convertible note hedge. In addition, in May 2013, warrants to acquire 32 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $104.80 originally sold in connection with the issuance of the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes were exercised resulting in a net cash payment of $100 million. See Note 7, Financing arrangements, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these transactions.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate, for the foreseeable future, to satisfy: our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends; and other business initiatives we may strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources 31of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of September 30, 2013, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $453 million, of which $352 million was past due. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary.Of our total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivable from sale of investments and restricted investments balances totaling $26.5 billion as of September 30, 2013, approximately $20.0 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of September 30, 2013.Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Nine months ended September 30, 2013 2012Net cash provided by operating activities$4,456 $5,070Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities1,649 (7,959)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities(1,081) 1,766OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, decreased due primarily to the receipt of $397 million of cash in the prior year period in connection with the termination of interest rate swap agreements and the timing of receipts from customers, including the impact of $197 million received under a government-funded program in Spain during the prior year period. InvestingCash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, was due primarily to net sales of marketable securities of $2.7 billion, offset partially by a restriction of investments of $526 million and capital expenditures of $492 million. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was due primarily to net purchases of marketable securities of $5.4 billion, acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired of $2.0 billion and capital expenditures of $489 million. Capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Ireland and Puerto Rico, as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2013 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.32FinancingCash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, was due primarily to the cash settlement of the $2.5 billion principal amount of the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes which matured/converted, repurchases of our common stock of $832 million and the payment of dividends of $1.1 billion, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of debt of $3.1 billion and net proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $268 million.Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was due primarily to the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $4.9 billion and the net proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $1.1 billion, offset partially by repurchases of our common stock of $3.4 billion and the payment of dividends of $844 million. See Note 7, Financing arrangements, and Note 8, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2013.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, and is incorporated herein by reference. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsTo achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2013, respectively, for an aggregate notional amount of $4.4 billion in contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2013. These derivative contracts qualify and have been designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges and effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating rate LIBOR-based coupon over the remaining lives of the hedged notes. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at September 30, 2013, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $310 million on our interest rate swap contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the ensuing year.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2013.Management determined that, as of September 30, 2013, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.33PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 11, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, 2013, June 30, 2013, and March 31, 2013, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, the primary risks related to our business and periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, provide additional disclosure and context for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate their operations may not be successful, and may result in costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions. We have an ongoing process of evaluating potential merger, acquisition, partnering and in-license opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint, product offerings and/or our R&D pipeline. For example, on October 1, 2013, we acquired Onyx, a biopharmaceutical company with several currently marketed products as well as pipeline candidates going through the development process. Acquisitions may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may result in the diversion of our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities.
