Overview  The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with GAAP.  Amgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as “Amgen,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is the world’s largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We focus solely on human therapeutics and concentrate on innovating novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We operate in one business segment — human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.  Currently, we market primarily recombinant protein therapeutics in supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products are: Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa) and EPOGEN® (epoetin alfa), erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs); Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim); NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim); and Enbrel® (etanercept), all of which are sold in the United States. We market ENBREL under a collaboration agreement with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) in the United States and Canada. Our international product sales consist principally of European sales of Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, our principal products represented 88% of worldwide product sales, and for the both three and six months ended June 30, 2010, our principal products represented 92% of worldwide product sales. Our other marketed products include Sensipar®/Mimpara® (cinacalcet), Vectibix® (panitumumab), Nplate® (romiplostim), Prolia® (denosumab) and XGEVA® (denosumab).  22    Table of Contents  Significant developments  The following is a list of selected significant developments that occurred to date during 2011 affecting our business. For additional 2011 developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011.  ESAs       •   On June 24, 2011, we announced that the FDA had approved changes to the labels for the use of ESAs, including Aranesp® and EPOGEN®, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). While the previous label language specified a hemoglobin target range of 10-12 grams per deciliter (g/dL) for CKD patients on dialysis as well as those not on dialysis, the modified labeling provides separate treatment guidance for these two populations. For patients on dialysis, who constitute the majority of CKD patients receiving ESA treatment, the new label advises physicians to initiate ESA therapy when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL and to reduce or interrupt the dose when the hemoglobin approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL. We refer in this report to these ESA label changes as the “June 2011 ESA label changes.”         •   On June 16, 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a Final Decision Memorandum (FDM) as part of its National Coverage Analysis (NCA) for ESAs in nephrology. In the FDM, CMS determined that it would not issue a national coverage determination (NCD) at that time for ESAs for treatment of anemia in adults with CKD, and that it would instead monitor the use of ESAs through the end stage renal disease (ESRD) bundled payment system and its other policy avenues.        •   On July 1, 2011, CMS released a proposed rule to update various provisions of its bundled payment system for dialysis services and the related ESRD Quality Incentive Program (QIP). Among the changes proposed by CMS for payment year 2013 is the elimination of one of the QIP’s quality measures which tracks the percent of a provider’s Medicare patients with a hemoglobin level below 10 g/dL. This quality measure was included by CMS in the QIP’s initial payment year, 2012 in part to provide a disincentive to providers/facilities to under-treat patients for anemia, particularly in light of the implementation of the new bundled payment system for dialysis services. CMS indicated that its proposed removal of this quality measure from the QIP was being done in response to the June 2011 ESA label changes. The proposed change to the QIP is subject to a 60-day public comment period, following which CMS is expected to issue a final rule on the QIP and also on its other proposed changes to the bundled payment system.    We expect decreases in ESA dose utilization related to the June 2011 ESA label changes and potentially from CMS’s proposed changes to the QIP. If CMS’s changes to the QIP are implemented as proposed, when combined with the impact of the June 2011 ESA label changes and CMS’s January 1, 2011 Final Rule on Bundling, we expect EPOGEN® dose utilization to decline in 2011 as compared with 2010 by 20% to 25%. We expect the impact of the dose utilization on sales to be offset partially by patient population growth and an increase in the average net sales price. We believe that the majority of these dose utilization changes will be implemented by the end of 2011 with some residual impact early in 2012. (See Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors — ESA developments.)  23    Table of Contents  XGEVA®       •   On May 17, 2011, we announced results of a pivotal phase 3 trial (‘147) in 1,432 men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer that has not yet spread to bone. The data showed that XGEVA® significantly improved median bone metastasis-free survival by 4.2 months, a risk reduction of 15%, compared with placebo (29.5 versus 25.2 months, respectively; hazard ratio (HR) 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73, 0.98; P=0.028). XGEVA® also significantly delayed the time to first bone metastases by 3.7 months compared with placebo (HR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.98; P=0.032; risk reduction of 16%). XGEVA® also reduced the risk of bone metastases that were symptomatic by 33% (HR 0.67; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.92; P=0.01). Overall survival was similar between groups (HR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.20; P=0.91), and the HR for progression-free survival was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.02, P=0.093). In the ‘147 trial, adverse events and serious adverse events were relatively similar between the XGEVA® and placebo arms. Hypocalcemia and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) were reported with increased frequencies in the XGEVA® treated patients. The yearly rate of ONJ in the XGEVA® arm was similar to prior XGEVA® trial results. Back pain was the most common adverse event reported in the XGEVA® arm of the trial.        •   On June 27, 2011, based on this ‘147 trial, we announced the submission of a supplemental BLA to the FDA to expand the indication for XGEVA® to treat men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer to reduce the risk of developing bone metastases. If approved, XGEVA® would be the first therapy licensed to prevent or delay the spread of cancer to the bone.        •   On July 15, 2011, we announced that the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for XGEVA® for the prevention of skeletal-related events (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or surgery to bone) in adults with bone metastases from solid tumors. The timing of reimbursement authority approval of pricing in individual EU countries will vary by country, which could follow the EC approval by many months. The EC also granted XGEVA® an additional year of data and market exclusivity in the EU since the indication was considered new for denosumab and based on the significant clinical benefit of XGEVA® in comparison with existing therapies.    Vectibix®       •   On June 24, 2011, we announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion recommending that Vectibix® be approved for use in the EU in first-line in combination with FOLFOX and in second-line in combination with FOLFIRI in patients who have received first-line fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (excluding irinotecan) for patients with wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).        •   On July 29, 2011, we announced that we received Complete Response Letters from the FDA on the first- and second-line mCRC supplemental BLAs. The FDA did not ask for new clinical studies, but requested an updated safety analysis and additional analyses of the overall survival data in the ‘181 and ‘203 studies, using more mature data sets. The FDA has also informed us that approval for the first- and second-line indications will also be contingent upon approval of the companion diagnostic device being developed in collaboration with QIAGEN N.V., which identifies a patient’s KRAS gene status. Amgen is reviewing the Complete Response Letters and will work with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps regarding these applications.    OncoVEXGM-CSF       •   On July 29, 2011, we announced our decision to terminate the current OncoVEXGM-CSF phase 3 trial in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) to permit significant modification of clinical trial design mandated by the changing therapeutic landscape for patients with SCCHN. The phase 3 trial in patients with malignant melanoma is ongoing.    Dividend       •   On July 28, 2011, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per share of common stock. This dividend will be paid on September 8, 2011 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 18, 2011.    24    Table of Contents     Selected Financial Data  Selected financial data was as follows (amounts in millions, except percentages and per share data):                                                               Three months ended             Six months ended                June 30,             June 30,                2011     2010     Change   2011     2010     Change     Product sales:                                                  U.S.   $ 2,975     $ 2,787       7  %   $ 5,753     $ 5,464       5  %   International     918       826       11  %     1,758       1,677       5  %                                              Total product sales     3,893       3,613       8  %     7,511       7,141       5  %                                                      Other revenues     66       191       (65 )%     154       255       (40 )%                                              Total revenues   $ 3,959     $ 3,804       4  %   $ 7,665     $ 7,396       4  %                                                                                                 Operating expenses   $ 2,627     $ 2,287       15  %   $ 5,040     $ 4,398       15  %                                                      Operating income   $ 1,332     $ 1,517       (12 )%   $ 2,625     $ 2,998       (12 )%                                                      Net income   $ 1,170     $ 1,202       (3 )%   $ 2,295     $ 2,369       (3 )%                                                      Diluted EPS   $ 1.25     $ 1.25       —     $ 2.45     $ 2.43       1  %                                                      Diluted shares     935       964       (3 )%     938       976       (4 )%     The following provides an overview of our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 as well as our financial condition as of June 30, 2011.  Our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were impacted by a new excise tax in Puerto Rico. Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the purchase of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. This tax is currently scheduled to expire in 2016. We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, a significant portion of the excise tax results in tax credits that are recognized in our provision for income taxes when the excise tax is paid. This excise tax will have a significant adverse impact on our cost of sales and a significant favorable impact on our provision for income taxes. In addition, the overall impact of the excise tax will vary from period to period as a result of the timing difference between recognizing the expense and the applicable tax credit. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, cost of sales was adversely impacted by $45 million and $58 million, respectively, and the provisions for income taxes were favorably impacted by $86 million and $153 million, respectively, as a result of this excise tax. The adverse impact of the new excise tax on cost of sales is expected to increase significantly in the remainder of 2011 as compared with the six months ended June 30, 2011.  The increases in U.S. product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were driven primarily by increases in sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®, ENBREL, XGEVA® and Prolia®, offset partially by decreases in sales of our ESA products, primarily EPOGEN®.  Excluding the $34 million and $26 million favorable impacts of foreign exchange, international product sales increased 7% and 3% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, respectively, generally reflecting sales growth for all our marketed products except Aranesp®.  The decreases in other revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were due principally to certain milestone payments earned during the three months ended June 30, 2010.  The increases in operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were driven primarily by the U.S. Healthcare Reform Federal Excise Fee; higher ENBREL profit share expenses; the excise tax associated with our manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico; and increased R&D expenses.  The decreases in net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were due primarily to lower operating income, offset partially by increases in interest and other income, net and by lower effective income tax rates, due primarily to higher tax credits in 2011 associated with the new Puerto Rico excise tax.  25    Table of Contents  Despite the decreases in net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, diluted EPS remained relatively unchanged, reflecting the favorable impacts of our stock repurchase program, which reduced the number of shares used in the computations of diluted EPS. Due to the aforementioned timing difference associated with the new Puerto Rico excise tax, our diluted EPS for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were favorably impacted by approximately $0.04 and $0.10, respectively.  As of June 30, 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $19.2 billion and total debt outstanding was $13.9 billion. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of June 30, 2011, approximately $15.3 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates.  Results of Operations  Product sales  Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                                               Three months ended             Six months ended                June 30,             June 30,                2011     2010     Change   2011     2010     Change     Aranesp®   $ 585     $ 603       (3 )%   $ 1,165     $ 1,230       (5 )%   EPOGEN®     543       657       (17 )%     1,078       1,280       (16 )%   Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®     1,326       1,174       13  %     2,558       2,353       9  %   ENBREL     956       877       9  %     1,831       1,681       9  %   Sensipar®/Mimpara®     199       172       16  %     386       351       10  %   Vectibix®     81       72       13  %     156       139       12  %   Nplate®     75       55       36  %     140       104       35  %   Prolia®     44       3       —       71       3       —    XGEVA®     73       —       —       115       —       —    Other     11       —       —       11       —       —                                               Total product sales   $ 3,893     $ 3,613       8  %   $ 7,511     $ 7,141       5  %                                                                                                 Total U.S.   $ 2,975     $ 2,787       7  %   $ 5,753     $ 5,464       5  %   Total International     918       826       11  %     1,758       1,677       5  %                                              Total product sales   $ 3,893     $ 3,613       8  %   $ 7,511     $ 7,141       5  %                                                Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others. For a list of certain of these factors, see Item 7 — Product Sales in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and Item 2 — Product Sales in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011.  Aranesp®  Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                                               Three months ended             Six months ended                June 30,             June 30,                2011     2010     Change   2011     2010     Change     Aranesp® — U.S.   $ 241     $ 267       (10 )%   $ 491     $ 535       (8 )%   Aranesp® — International     344       336       2  %     674       695       (3 )%                                              Total Aranesp®   $ 585     $ 603       (3 )%   $ 1,165     $ 1,230       (5 )%                                                26    Table of Contents  The decreases in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were due principally to mid-teens percentage point decreases in unit demand, offset partially by increases in the average net sales price. These sales decreases reflected overall declines in the segment.  Excluding the $10 million favorable impact of foreign exchange, the decrease in international Aranesp sales for the three months ended June 30, 2011 was due principally to a low single-digit percentage point decrease in the average net sales price, offset substantially by an increase in unit demand. This sales decrease reflected an overall decline in the segment, offset largely by an increase in share and expansion into newer territories. The decrease in international Aranesp® sales for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was due principally to a decrease in the average net sales price, reflecting an overall decline in the segment.  Future Aranesp® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011, and such factors as:       •   reimbursement developments, including CMS’s proposed changes related to the QIP, if implemented as currently proposed; and        •   regulatory developments, including the June 2011 ESA label changes.    EPOGEN®  Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                                               Three months ended             Six months ended                June 30,             June 30,                2011     2010     Change   2011     2010     Change     EPOGEN® — U.S.   $ 543     $ 657       (17 )%   $ 1,078     $ 1,280       (16 )%                                                The decreases in EPOGEN® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were due primarily to declines in unit demand. The decreases in unit demand reflected decreases in dose utilization due to implementation of the bundled payment system, offset slightly by patient population growth.  Future EPOGEN® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011, and such factors as:       •   reimbursement developments, including CMS’s proposed changes related to the QIP, if implemented as currently proposed; and        •   regulatory developments, including the June 2011 ESA label changes.    27    Table of Contents  Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®  Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                                               Three months ended             Six months ended                June 30,             June 30,                2011     2010     Change   2011     2010     Change     Neulasta® — U.S.   $ 769     $ 643       20  %   $ 1,479     $ 1,280       16  %   NEUPOGEN® — U.S.     230       225       2  %     450       450       —                                               U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total     999       868       15  %     1,929       1,730       12  %                                              Neulasta® — International     246       218       13  %     472       444       6  %   NEUPOGEN® — International     81       88       (8 )%     157       179       (12 )%                                              International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total     327       306       7  %     629       623       1  %                                              Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®   $ 1,326     $ 1,174       13  %   $ 2,558     $ 2,353       9  %                                                The increases in combined U.S. sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were driven primarily by increases in unit demand for Neulasta® and the average net sales price. For the three months ended June 30, 2011, approximately half of the unit demand increase reflected underlying Neulasta® demand growth including increased first cycle penetration due to uses of newer, more myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens. The remaining unit demand growth was driven primarily by the timing of customer orders.  Excluding the $14 million favorable impact of foreign exchange, the increase in combined Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® international sales for the three months ended June 30, 2011 reflects growth in Neulasta® sales due partially to continued conversion from NEUPOGEN® to Neulasta®. Excluding the $11 million favorable impact of foreign exchange, the decrease in combined Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® international sales for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was driven by a decline in NEUPOGEN® sales due in part to biosimilar competition, offset partially by an increase in Neulasta® sales due in part to continued conversion of NEUPOGEN® to Neulasta®.  Future Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales will depend in part on factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  ENBREL  Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                                               Three months ended             Six months ended                June 30,             June 30,                2011     2010     Change   2011     2010     Change     ENBREL — U.S.   $ 894     $ 819       9  %   $ 1,715     $ 1,573       9  %   ENBREL — Canada     62       58       7  %     116       108       7  %                                              Total ENBREL   $ 956     $ 877       9  %   $ 1,831     $ 1,681       9  %                                                The increases in ENBREL sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were driven primarily by increases in the average net sales price and unit demand. These sales increases reflected segment growth, offset partially by share declines. ENBREL remains the leader in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments.

Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 was 14.3% and 14.8%, respectively.  Research and development  The increases in R&D expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 reflected: (i) increased costs associated with late stage clinical programs of $79 million and $151 million, respectively, particularly for the phase 3 trials for AMG 386, AMG 479 and OncoVEXGM-CSF; (ii) increased support for our marketed products of $50 million and $65 million, respectively, including support for Prolia®, among other programs, our international expansion efforts, and lower recoveries from ongoing collaborations; and (iii) increases in discovery research and early pipeline activities of $15 million and $18 million, respectively, in part due to process development efforts in support of our early pipeline.  Selling, general and administrative  The increases in SG&A expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were driven primarily by the U.S. Healthcare Reform Federal Excise Fee of $47 million and $86 million; higher ENBREL profit share expenses of $40 million and $70 million, under our collaboration agreement with Pfizer, due to increased ENBREL sales; and higher spending related to the launches of Prolia® and XGEVA®, as well as expansion of our international operations, of $37 million and $67 million, respectively.  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share were $334 million and $633 million, and $294 million and $563 million, respectively.  Under our collaboration agreement, we currently pay Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada attributable to all approved indications for ENBREL on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, we maintain a majority share of ENBREL profits. After expiration of the agreement in the fourth quarter of 2013, we will be required to pay Pfizer a declining percentage of annual net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada for three years, ranging from 12% to 10%. The amounts of such payments are anticipated to be significantly less than what would be owed based on the terms of the current ENBREL profit share.  30    Table of Contents  Non-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes  Non-operating expenses/income and the provisions for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):                                             Three months ended     Six months ended        June 30,     June 30,        2011     2010     2011     2010      Interest expense, net   $ 122     $ 147     $ 257     $ 292    Interest and other income, net   $ 129     $ 94     $ 277     $ 178    Provisions for income taxes   $ 169     $ 262     $ 350     $ 515    Effective tax rate     12.6 %     17.9 %     13.2 %     17.9 %     Interest expense, net  The decreases in interest expense, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were due primarily to the repayment of the 2011 Convertible Notes in February 2011.  Interest and other income, net  The increases in interest and other income, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were due primarily to higher net realized gains on investments of $17 million and $77 million, respectively. Additionally, these increases were due to losses of $12 million in the prior year on certain leased facilities that will no longer be used in our operations.  Income taxes  Our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were 12.6% and 13.2%, respectively, compared with 17.9% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. The decreases in our effective tax rates were due primarily to higher tax credits in 2011 associated with the new Puerto Rico excise tax and the federal R&D credit that were not in effect during the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, offset partially by the effect of the non-deductible U.S. Healthcare Reform Federal Excise Fee beginning in 2011. Our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 would have been 18.4% and 18.6%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the new Puerto Rico excise tax.  See Note 3, Income taxes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  31    Table of Contents  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources  Selected financial data was as follows (in millions):                             June 30,     December 31,        2011     2010      Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities   $ 19,172     $ 17,422    Total assets     46,936       43,486    Current debt     83       2,488    Non-current debt     13,847       10,874    Stockholders’ equity     25,614       23,944      The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends. On April 20, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of our common stock and as of June 30, 2011, we had $6.4 billion remaining under the Board of Directors’ stock repurchase authorizations. On April 20, 2011, the Board of Directors also approved a dividend policy related to our common stock. Subsequently, on July 28, 2011, the Board of Directors declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per share of common stock. This dividend will be paid on September 8, 2011, to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 18, 2011. Both our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock reflect our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. Repurchases under our stock repurchase program also reflect our confidence in the long-term value of our common stock. The amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a number of factors including the stock price, dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares, and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of factors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock in Part II of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011.  We believe existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and opportunistically repurchase stock; as well as other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sale of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States (U.S. funds), cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts, and existing sources of and access to financing in the United States are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (as well as our plans to pay dividends and opportunistically repurchase stock with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. In February 2011, we repaid our 2011 Convertible Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $2.5 billion with available U.S. funds. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of June 30, 2011. None of our financing arrangements contain any financial covenants.  32    Table of Contents  Cash flows  Our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions):                             Six months ended June 30,        2011     2010      Net cash provided by operating activities   $ 2,566     $ 2,477    Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities     291       (2,390 )   Net cash used in financing activities     (146 )     (1,259 )     Operating  Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2011 increased due primarily to the timing and amounts of payments to tax authorities, offset partially by the impact of increased inventory related expenditures and the timing and amount of receipts from customers and payments to vendors.  Investing  Cash provided by investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2011 was primarily from net sales of marketable securities of $1.2 billion, offset partially by cash used to acquire businesses totaling $701 million, net of cash acquired. For the six months ended June 30, 2010 cash used in investing activities was primarily from the net purchase of marketable securities of $2.1 billion. Capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 totaled $223 million and $271 million, respectively. Capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and other site developments. We currently estimate 2011 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $600 million.  Financing  In June 2011, we issued $750 million principal amount of notes due in 2016 (the 2016 Notes), $1.0 billion principal amount of notes due in 2021 (the 2021 Notes) and $1.25 billion principal amount of notes due in 2042 (the 2042 Notes) in a registered offering. The 2016 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2042 Notes pay interest at fixed annual rates of 2.30%, 4.10% and 5.65%, respectively. In February 2011, the 2011 Convertible Notes became due and we repaid the $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount. See Note 8, Financing arrangements to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  During the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, we repurchased 12.9 million and 39.4 million shares of our common stock, respectively, at a total cost of $732 million and $2.3 billion, respectively. In addition, during the current year period we had a net cash outflow of $13 million related to the settlement of shares repurchased during the three months ended December 31, 2010.  33    Table of Contents  Summary of Critical Accounting Policies  A discussion of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and is supplemented with the accounting policy discussed below.  Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations  We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to:       •   determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;        •   projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;        •   estimating future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and        •   developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows.    Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred in the acquisition of BioVex were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations.  We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.  34    Table of Contents             Item 3.

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2011.  Management determined that, as of June 30, 2011, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  35    Table of Contents     PART II — OTHER INFORMATION             Item 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    See Note 12, Contingencies and commitments to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2011 and March 31, 2011 for discussions which are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. These discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 19, Contingencies and commitments to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.             Item 1A.    RISK FACTORS    This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described the primary risks relating to our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and periodically update those risks for material developments. These risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, operations, liquidity and stock price materially and adversely.  Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and in Part II, Item 1A, of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011, provide additional disclosure and context for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.  The information below regarding ESA developments updates the following risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011: — Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers; — Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval; and — Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.  ESA developments  On June 16, 2011, CMS issued an FDM as part of its NCA for ESAs in nephrology. In the FDM, CMS determined that it would not issue an NCD at that time for ESAs for treatment of anemia in adults with CKD, and that it would instead monitor the use of ESAs through the ESRD bundled payment system and its other policy avenues. While this decision concludes this NCA process for ESAs in nephrology, CMS can undertake a reconsideration of the FDM or initiate another NCA related to ESAs in nephrology.  On June 24, 2011, we announced that the FDA had approved changes to the labels for the use of ESAs, including Aranesp® and EPOGEN®, in patients with CKD. (See Part I. Item 2. MD&A — Significant developments — ESAs.) As a result of the June 2011 ESA label changes, physicians may reduce the use of ESAs in certain patients or at certain times. We do not know what effect, if any, the June 2011 ESA label changes will have on the proposed Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes group treatment guidelines that are expected to be announced in 2011. (See Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors — Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.) In addition, regulatory authorities in other countries may review the June 2011 ESA label changes and may seek to make similar or other changes to the ESA labeling in their respective jurisdictions.  On July 1, 2011, CMS released a proposed rule to update various provisions of its bundled payment system for dialysis services and the related ESRD QIP. (See Part I. Item 2. MD&A — Significant developments — ESAs.) This proposed change would eliminate the QIP’s hemoglobin-less-than-10 reporting requirement and financial penalty that can occur when the hemoglobin level of a percentage of the provider’s dialysis patients drops below 10 g/dL compared to national benchmark data. As a result of this change, providers could use less ESAs in their dialysis patients. This reduction in ESA use may occur even before CMS determines whether these QIP changes will be implemented as currently proposed.  We expect decreases in dose utilization related to the June 2011 ESA label changes and potentially from CMS’s proposed changes to the QIP. If CMS’s changes to the QIP are implemented as proposed, when combined with the impact of the June 2011 ESA label changes and CMS’s January 1, 2011 Final Rule on Bundling, we expect EPOGEN® dose utilization to decline in 2011 as compared with 2010 by 20% to 25%. We expect the impact of the dose utilization on sales to be offset partially by patient population growth and an increase in the average net sales price. We believe that the majority of these dose utilization changes will be implemented by the end of 2011 with some residual impact early in 2012. Our ESA business could be further impacted by additional ESA labeling changes, additional changes in ESA coverage and reimbursement, unanticipated changes in physician prescribing practices or new or reinterpreted clinical data.  36    Table of Contents  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.  See ESA-related developments above.  We now expect CMS to issue a proposed rule further defining the new average manufacturing price (AMP) definition in the third quarter of 2011. Until that rule is issued, we will be required to apply our judgment in certain aspects of the AMP calculation. Once the CMS rule has been issued, we will have to determine whether our interpretation of AMP follows the rule or would need to be restated and this could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.  See ESA-related developments above.  Some of our products are approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis, with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. Vectibix®, for example, received accelerated approval in the United States and conditional approval in the EU, with full approval conditioned on conducting additional clinical trials of the use of Vectibix® as a therapy in treating mCRC. If we are unable to fulfill the requirements of regulators that were conditions of our products’ accelerated or conditional approval, we may not receive full approval for these products or may be required to change the products’ labeled indications or even withdraw the products from the market. Regulatory authorities are focusing on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. Following recent FDA and FDA advisory committee discussions and actions with respect to other therapeutic oncology products previously granted accelerated approval by the FDA, questions remain about regulatory authorities’ views regarding the adequacy for approval of therapeutic oncology products that have demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival but have not shown a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. Endpoints such as progression-free survival and bone-metastasis-free survival are often used as surrogate endpoints for overall survival. Some of our products and product candidates, including some for which BLAs are pending, have utilized one or more of these surrogate endpoints in the clinical trial data submitted for agency review or in clinical trials now being conducted.  Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.  See ESA-related developments above.  Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business.  Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by economic conditions. Sales of our principal products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and private payer healthcare and insurance programs. (See Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) In the United States, there is an increased focus from the federal government and others on analyzing the impact of various regulatory programs on the federal deficit, which could result in increased pressure on federal programs to reduce costs. For example, on August 2, 2011, President Obama signed a bill that raises the U.S. federal debt ceiling and mandates significant additional deficit reduction over the next decade. Details about where the specific reductions in federal spending will occur will be addressed at a later time. In addition, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment through mandatory discounts on our products, policies requiring the automatic substitution of generic products, higher hurdles for initial reimbursement approval for new products or other similar measures. Additionally, as a result of the current global economic downturn, our third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from government and/or private payer healthcare programs or increased competition from lower cost biosimilar products could have a material adverse affect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations.  If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.  37    Table of Contents  From time to time, U.S. and other policymakers have proposed reforming the patent laws and regulations of their countries. For example, patent reform legislation was introduced in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate during the 111th Congress in 2009 but was not adopted into law. In 2011, both the House and Senate passed patent reform legislation; however, differences between the House and Senate bills would need to be reconciled, or both branches of Congress would need to pass the same bill, before the legislation could be signed into law by the President. In general, the proposed U.S. legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for challenging patents. While we cannot predict what form any new patent reform laws or regulations may ultimately take, final legislation could introduce new substantive rules and procedures for challenging patents, and certain reforms that make it easier for competitors to challenge our patents could have a material adverse effect on our business.  38    Table of Contents             Item 2.    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS    Repurchases under our stock repurchase program also reflect our confidence in the long-term value of our common stock. The amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a number of factors including the stock price, dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares, and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases as well as market transactions.  Our repurchase activity for the three months ended June 30, 2011 was as follows:                                                            Total number of     Maximum $ value        Total number     Average     shares purchased     that may yet be        of shares     price paid     as part of publicly     purchased under the        purchased     per share     announced programs     programs(1)      April 1 - April 30     6,926,000     $ 56.01       6,926,000     $ 6,775,473,148    May 1 - May 31     5,940,129       57.86       5,940,129       6,431,749,468    June 1 - June 30     —       —       —       6,431,749,468                                         12,866,129       56.87       12,866,129                                                         (1)    In December 2009, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock, and in April 2011, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of our common stock. A total of $6.4 billion remained available as of June 30, 2011.              Item 5.    OTHER INFORMATION    Frequency of Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation  Consistent with our Board of Directors’ recommendation in our 2011 Proxy Statement and the vote of our stockholders at our 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our Board of Directors has determined that the stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation will occur on an annual basis.
