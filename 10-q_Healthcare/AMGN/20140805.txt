We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, EPS, liquidity and capital resources, trends and planned dividends, stock repurchases and restructuring plans. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.OverviewThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2014. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with GAAP.Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its biologics manufacturing expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people’s lives. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be the world’s largest independent biotechnology company, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.Currently, we market primarily recombinant protein therapeutics for supportive cancer care, inflammation, nephrology and bone disease. Our principal products are Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), NEUPOGEN® (filgrastim), Enbrel® (etanercept), XGEVA® (denosumab), Prolia® (denosumab), Sensipar®/Mimpara® (cinacalcet) and our erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa) and EPOGEN® (epoetin alfa). Our product sales outside the United States consist principally of sales in Europe. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, our principal products represented 92% of worldwide product sales. We market several other products including Vectibix® (panitumumab), Nplate® (romiplostim) and, through our wholly owned subsidiary Onyx, Kyprolis® (carfilzomib).24Significant developmentsFollowing is a summary of selected significant developments affecting our business that have occurred since March 31, 2014. For additional developments or for a more comprehensive discussion of certain developments discussed below, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2014.Products/Pipeline Brodalumab•In May 2014, we and AstraZeneca announced that the phase 3 AMAGINE-1TM study evaluating brodalumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis met all primary and secondary endpoints for both evaluated doses.Vectibix® •In May 2014, we announced that the FDA has approved Vectibix® for use in combination with FOLFOX, an oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimen, as first-line treatment in patients with wild-type KRAS (exon 2) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).Blinatumomab•In July 2014, we announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to investigational bispecific T cell engager (BiTE®) antibody blinatumomab, for adults with Philadelphia-negative (Ph-) relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL, a rapidly progressing cancer of the blood and bone marrow.AMG 416 (formerly known as velcalcetide) •In July 2014, we announced that a phase 3 study evaluating AMG 416 for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease receiving hemodialysis, met its primary and all secondary endpoints.Ivabradine•In July 2014, we announced that we submitted a New Drug Application for chronic heart failure in the United States.Talimogene laherparepvec•In July 2014, we announced that we submitted a BLA in the United States for regionally and distantly metastatic melanoma.Kyprolis® •In August 2014, we and our subsidiary Onyx announced that a planned interim analysis demonstrated that the phase 3 clinical trial ASPIRE (CArfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and DexamethaSone versus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for the treatment of PatIents with Relapsed Multiple MyEloma) met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival. Patients treated with Kyprolis® for Injection in combination with Revlimid® (lenalidomide) and low-dose dexamethasone (KRd) lived significantly longer without their disease worsening (median 26.3 months) compared to patients treated with Revlimid and low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) (median 17.6 months). While the data for overall survival, a secondary endpoint, are not yet mature, the analysis showed a trend in favor of KRd that did not reach statistical significance. The safety profile observed in this study is consistent with the current U.S. Kyprolis® label, including the rate of cardiac events. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events and on-study deaths were comparable between the two arms. No new safety signals were identified.Reallocating Resources to Drive Growth•In July 2014, we announced a restructuring plan under which we will reduce staff by 2,400 to 2,900 by the end of 2015 and close our facilities in the states of Washington and Colorado. We will also reduce the number of buildings at our headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California. These actions will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $775 million to $950 million, primarily incurred in 2014 and 2015.25Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2014 2013 Change 2014 2013 ChangeProduct sales:           U.S.$3,758 $3,561 6% $7,047 $6,733 5 %Rest of the world (ROW)1,191 1,034 15% 2,258 2,013 12 %Total product sales4,949 4,595 8% 9,305 8,746 6 %Other revenues231 84 * 396 171 *Total revenues$5,180 $4,679 11% $9,701 $8,917 9 %Operating expenses$3,278 $3,129 5% $6,435 $5,925 9 %Operating income$1,902 $1,550 23% $3,266 $2,992 9 %Net income$1,547 $1,258 23% $2,620 $2,692 (3)%Diluted EPS$2.01 $1.65 22% $3.41 $3.52 (3)%Diluted shares768 764 1% 768 764 1 %* Change in excess of 100%The increase in global product sales for the three months ended June 30, 2014, was driven by the addition of Kyprolis® as a result of the Onyx acquisition on October 1, 2013 and ENBREL, Prolia® and XGEVA®. The increase in global product sales for the six months ended June 30, 2014, was driven by Kyprolis®, Prolia®, XGEVA® and Neulasta®. Product sales in the second quarter of 2013 included a positive adjustment of $185 million to previous estimates for managed Medicaid rebates based on claims experience (the Medicaid rebate estimate adjustment).The increases in other revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, were due primarily to our Nexavar® collaboration revenues and Stivarga® royalties as a result of the Onyx acquisition.The increases in operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, were driven primarily by Cost of sales as a result of acquisition-related expenses, including amortization of the acquired developed product technology rights.The increases in net income and diluted EPS for the three months ended June 30, 2014, were driven by the increase in operating income. The decreases in net income and diluted EPS for the six months ended June 30, 2014, were due primarily to favorable tax items in the three months ended March 31, 2013.Results of operationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2014 2013 Change  2014 2013 Change Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®$1,429 $1,444 (1)% $2,808 $2,782 1 %ENBREL1,243 1,157 7 % 2,231 2,196 2 %Aranesp®517 524 (1)% 977 992 (2)%EPOGEN®512 502 2 % 974 937 4 %XGEVA® 299 249 20 % 578 472 22 %Prolia® 264 188 40 % 460 330 39 %Sensipar®/Mimpara®298 259 15 % 568 523 9 %Other products387 272 42 % 709 514 38 %Total product sales$4,949 $4,595 8 % $9,305 $8,746 6 %Future sales of our products are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others.

Risk Factors and Item 7 — Product Sales in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2014 2013 Change  2014 2013 Change Neulasta®— U.S.$895 $897 — % $1,747 $1,724 1 %Neulasta®— ROW238 223 7 % 476 435 9 %Total Neulasta®1,133 1,120 1 % 2,223 2,159 3 %NEUPOGEN®— U.S.214 267 (20)% 428 509 (16)%NEUPOGEN®— ROW82 57 44 % 157 114 38 %Total NEUPOGEN®296 324 (9)% 585 623 (6)%Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®$1,429 $1,444 (1)% $2,808 $2,782 1 %Our material U.S. patents for filgrastim (NEUPOGEN®) expired in December 2013. We now face competition in the United States, which may have a material adverse impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN® and, to a lesser extent, Neulasta®. In addition, in July 2014, Sandoz Inc. announced that the FDA has accepted its BLA(k) for a biosimilar version of filgrastim under the new biosimilar regulatory pathway. Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) expires in 2015. Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® underlying demand was slightly impacted by short- and long-acting competition in the United States and Europe, respectively. ROW included sales in new markets as a result of reacquiring rights to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective January 1, 2014.The increase in global Neulasta® sales for the three months ended June 30, 2014, was driven mainly by an increase in the average net sales price in the United States, offset partially by the positive Medicaid rebate estimate adjustment in the prior year. The increase in global Neulasta® sales for the six months ended June 30, 2014, was driven mainly by an increase in the average net sales price in the United States, offset partially by a unit decline in the United States.The decreases in global NEUPOGEN® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, were driven by a unit decline in the United States and by the positive Medicaid rebate estimate adjustment in the prior year, offset partially by the increased sales as a result of reacquiring rights to filgrastim in certain regions.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2014 2013 Change  2014 2013 Change ENBREL — U.S.$1,171 $1,089 8% $2,095 $2,063 2%ENBREL — Canada72 68 6% 136 133 2%Total ENBREL$1,243 $1,157 7% $2,231 $2,196 2%The increase in ENBREL sales for the three months ended June 30, 2014, was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price. There was a slight inventory build at the end of the second quarter of 2014 that we expect will be drawn down in the third quarter of 2014. The increase in ENBREL sales for the six months ended June 30, 2014, was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by a decline in unit demand.27Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2014 2013 Change  2014 2013 Change Aranesp® — U.S.$223 $228 (2)% $400 $396 1 %Aranesp® — ROW294 296 (1)% 577 596 (3)%Total Aranesp®$517 $524 (1)% $977 $992 (2)%The decreases in global Aranesp® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, were driven primarily by the positive Medicaid rebate estimate adjustment in the prior year. Underlying demand continues to decrease slightly due to practice patterns in the United States and competitive pricing pressures in Europe.EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2014 2013 Change  2014 2013 Change EPOGEN® — U.S.$512 $502 2% $974 $937 4%The increases in EPOGEN® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, were driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by the positive Medicaid rebate estimate adjustment in the prior year. Unit demand continues to be relatively stable.EPOGEN® and Aranesp® may face competition in the future from a launch of MIRCERA® in the United States. Pursuant to a December 2009 settlement agreement between Amgen and Roche, Roche is now allowed to begin selling MIRCERA® in the United States under terms of a limited license agreement.XGEVA® and Prolia®  Total XGEVA® and total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2014 2013 Change  2014 2013 Change XGEVA® — U.S.$207 $189 10% $407 $367 11%XGEVA® — ROW92 60 53% 171 105 63%Total XGEVA®299 249 20% 578 472 22%Prolia® — U.S.159 118 35% 278 205 36%Prolia® — ROW105 70 50% 182 125 46%Total Prolia®264 188 40% 460 330 39%Total XGEVA®/Prolia®$563 $437 29% $1,038 $802 29%The increases in global XGEVA® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, were driven by increases in unit demand. XGEVA® continues to capture share in a growing market despite competition from generic zoledronic acid.The increases in global Prolia® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, were driven by increases in unit demand from share growth. 28Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2014 2013 Change  2014 2013 Change Sensipar® — U.S.$204 $178 15% $382 $357 7%Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW94 81 16% 186 166 12%Total Sensipar®/Mimpara®$298 $259 15% $568 $523 9%The increases in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, were driven primarily by increases in the average net sales price in the United States and unit growth, offset partially by favorable changes in accounting estimates in the prior year.Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2014 2013 Change  2014 2013 Change Vectibix® — U.S.$36 $31 16 % $75 $58 29 %Vectibix® — ROW96 62 55 % 160 122 31 %Nplate® — U.S.62 62 — % 124 117 6 %Nplate® — ROW56 43 30 % 107 84 27 %Kyprolis® — U.S.75 — N/A 137 — N/AKyprolis® — ROW3 — N/A 9 — N/AOther — ROW59 74 (20)% 97 133 (27)%Total other products$387 $272 42 % $709 $514 38 %Total U.S. — other products$173 $93 86 % $336 $175 92 %Total ROW — other products214 179 20 % 373 339 10 %Total other products$387 $272 42 % $709 $514 38 %Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended   Six months ended   June 30,   June 30,   2014 2013 Change  2014 2013 Change Cost of sales$1,081 $785 38 % $2,171 $1,529 42 %% of product sales21.8% 17.1%   23.3% 17.5%  Research and development$1,018 $967 5 % $2,045 $1,845 11 %% of product sales20.6% 21.0%   22.0% 21.1%  Selling, general and administrative$1,136 $1,256 (10)% $2,159 $2,414 (11)%% of product sales23.0% 27.3%   23.2% 27.6%  Other$43 $121 (64)% $60 $137 (56)%29Cost of salesCost of sales increased to 21.8% and 23.3% of product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, driven by acquisition-related expenses that included $203 million and $422 million, respectively, of non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Onyx acquisition. The six months ended June 30, 2014, also included a $99-million charge related to the termination of the supply contract with Roche as a result of acquiring the licenses to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective January 1, 2014. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, Cost of sales would have been 19.9% and 21.3% of product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared with 15.5% and 15.6% of product sales for the corresponding periods of the prior year. See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Research and developmentThe increase in R&D expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2014, was driven primarily by increased costs of $124 million associated with Onyx across all categories of R&D spend. Overall, costs associated with later stage clinical program support increased $88 million, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $29 million and Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities of $8 million.The increase in R&D expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2014, was driven primarily by increased costs of $244 million associated with Onyx across all categories of R&D spend, as well as increased costs associated with other later stage clinical program support. Overall, costs associated with later stage clinical program support increased $264 million, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $46 million and Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities of $18 million.Selling, general and administrativeThe decreases in SG&A expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, were driven primarily by the expiration of the ENBREL profit share in October 2013, which reduced expenses by $242 million and $462 million, respectively. These declines were offset partially by the addition of $61 million and $118 million, respectively, as a result of the Onyx acquisition.OtherOther operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, included certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives, primarily severance, of $23 million and $38 million and increases to the estimated aggregate fair value of the contingent consideration obligations of $14 million and $15 million, respectively.Other operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, included increases to the estimated aggregate fair value of the contingent consideration obligations related to talimogene laherparepvec of $110 million and $111 million, respectively.RestructuringWe announced a restructuring plan in July 2014, to invest in continuing innovation and the launch of our new pipeline molecules, while improving our cost structure. As a first step, we will reduce staff by 2,400 to 2,900 by the end of 2015 and close our facilities in the states of Washington and Colorado. Our headquarters will remain in Thousand Oaks, California with a reduced number of staff consolidated into fewer of the existing buildings. Company-wide, these actions will result in an approximate 23% reduction in our facilities footprint. These actions will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $775 million to $950 million, primarily incurred in 2014 and 2015. As a next step, we are evaluating additional efficiency initiatives, particularly in the area of shared services and other external expense categories to support our growth objectives.30Non-operating expenses/income and income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Three months ended Six months ended June 30, June 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013Interest expense, net$282 $241 $541 $504Interest and other income, net$138 $96 $237 $260Provision for income taxes$211 $147 $342 $56Effective tax rate12.0% 10.5% 11.5% 2.0%Interest expense, netThe increase in interest expense, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, was due primarily to the recognition of expenses in connection with the repayment of the Master Repurchase Agreement obligation and a higher average outstanding debt balance in the current year. Interest and other income, netThe increase in interest and other income, net for the three months ended June 30, 2014, was due primarily to higher net gains on sales of investments recognized in the current year period. The decrease in interest and other income, net for the six months ended June 30, 2014, was due primarily to higher net gains on sales of investments recognized in prior year period, most of which occurred during the first quarter of 2013.Income taxesOur effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, were 12.0% and 11.5%, respectively, compared with 10.5% and 2.0% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2014, is due primarily to the exclusion of the benefit of the R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2013, and was not reinstated as of June 30, 2014. The increase was offset partially by the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses due primarily to higher domestic acquisition-related expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2014.For the six months ended June 30, 2014, the effective tax rate increased due primarily to two significant events that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2013. First, we settled our federal income tax examination for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009 in which we agreed to certain adjustments and remeasured our UTBs accordingly, resulting in a net tax benefit of approximately $185 million. Second, our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2013, included a benefit of approximately $60 million for the full-year 2012 federal R&D tax credit, recorded as a discrete item in the first quarter of 2013. In addition, our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2014, does not include a benefit for the federal R&D tax credit. The increase was offset partially by the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses due primarily to higher domestic acquisition-related expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2014.Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, would have been 16.7% and 16.2%, respectively, compared with 15.6% and 7.5% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.See Note 3, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Financial condition, liquidity and capital resourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): June 30, 2014 December 31, 2013Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$26,188 $19,401Restricted investments— 3,412 Total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investments$26,188 $22,813Total assets$69,534 $66,125Current portion of long-term debt$2,500 $2,505Long-term debt$30,828 $29,623Stockholders’ equity$24,382 $22,09631The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. Whether and when we declare dividends and the size of any dividend could be affected by a number of factors. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Item 1A. Risk Factors — There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.) In December 2013 and March 2014, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.61 per share of common stock, which was paid on March 7 and June 6, 2014, respectively. On July 25, 2014, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.61 per share of common stock which will be paid on September 5, 2014.The Company has also returned capital to stockholders through its stock repurchase program, however we have not made repurchases under this program since the first quarter of 2013. As of June 30, 2014, $1.6 billion remained available under our Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program. While we may repurchase additional shares of our common stock in the future, we do not currently have plans to make any significant repurchases during the remainder of 2014 and 2015.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate, for the foreseeable future, to satisfy: our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends; and other business initiatives we may strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Item 1A. Risk Factors — Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of June 30, 2014, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $347 million, of which $216 million was past due. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary.Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaling $26.2 billion as of June 30, 2014, approximately $23 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan Credit Facility each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of June 30, 2014. On July 30, 2014, we entered into a revolving credit agreement for a total commitment of $2.5 billion, which amends and restates our revolving credit agreement dated December 2, 2011 (the 2011 Agreement). This amended and restated agreement extended the commitment term from the 2011 Agreement, but is otherwise on substantially similar terms to the 2011 Agreement. The commitments of each bank under this amended and restated agreement have an initial term of five years and may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. 32Cash flowsOur cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): Six months ended June 30, 2014 2013Net cash provided by operating activities$3,369 $2,649Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities$(3,223) $3,768Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$401 $(3,868)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2014, benefited from timing of receipts from customers, including the impact of $100 million received under a government-funded program in Spain, and lower payments to taxing authorities, offset partially by the termination of the supply contract with Roche.InvestingCash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2014, was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities and restricted investments of $2.6 billion, capital expenditures of $345 million and cash paid for acquisitions of $115 million. Cash provided by investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2013, was due primarily to net sales of marketable securities of $4.1 billion offset partially by capital expenditures of $317 million. Capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Singapore, Ireland and Puerto Rico, as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2014 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $800 million.FinancingCash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2014, was due primarily to the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.5 billion offset partially by the repayment of long-term debt of $3.4 billion and the payment of dividends of $923 million.Cash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2013, was due primarily to the cash settlement of the $2.5 billion principal amount of the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes which matured/converted, repurchases of our common stock of $832 million and the payment of dividends of $707 million, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with our equity award programs of $212 million. See Note 8, Financing arrangements, and Note 9, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Critical accounting policiesThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2014.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, and is incorporated herein by reference. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes during the six months ended June 30, 2014, to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsIn May 2014, we issued $4.5 billion aggregate principal amount of debt, comprised of fixed and floating rate notes, and we repaid $3.1 billion of floating rate debt. See Note 8, Financing arrangements in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 33As of June 30, 2014, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $33.3 billion and a fair value of $35.6 billion. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at June 30, 2014, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.5 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts.In connection with the issuance of a portion of fixed rate debt issued in May 2014, we entered into $2.25 billion aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap contracts, which qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges. These derivative contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective notes. As of June 30, 2014, we had outstanding interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $6.65 billion. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at June 30, 2014, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $380 million on interest rate swap contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the ensuing 12 months.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2014.Management determined that, as of June 30, 2014, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSSee Note 12, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2014, and March 31, 2014, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, provide additional disclosure and context for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.34We may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs and not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from our recently announced restructuring plan.On July 29, 2014, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations to deliver on the Company’s strategy while also improving the Company’s cost structure. As part of the restructuring plan, we plan to reduce staff and close or dispose of certain facilities. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits and savings from our restructuring efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.Following the completion of our restructuring, we must execute our core business initiatives with fewer human resources. We must also attract, retain and motivate key employees that are critical to our business. If we are unable to effectively execute with fewer staff members and/or attract, retain or motivate key employees, it may adversely affect our business.Item 6. EXHIBITS
