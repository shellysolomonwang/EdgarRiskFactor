Item 1A. Risk Factors  A restated description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. This description includes any material changes to and supersedes the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.  If the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  Approximately 34% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 were generated from patients who have commercial payors as the primary payor. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that pay us on terms and at rates that are generally significantly higher than Medicare rates. The payments we receive from commercial payors generate nearly all of our profit and all of our nonacute dialysis profits come from commercial payors. We continue to experience downward pressure on some of our commercial payment rates and it is possible that commercial payment rates could be materially lower in the future. The downward pressure on commercial payment rates is a result of general conditions in the market, recent and future consolidations among commercial payors, increased focus on dialysis services and other factors.  We are continuously in the process of negotiating our existing or potentially new agreements with commercial payors who tend to be aggressive in their negotiations with us. Sometimes many significant agreements are up for renewal or being renegotiated at the same time. In the event that our continual negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, the cumulative effect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Consolidations have significantly increased the negotiating leverage of commercial payors. Our negotiations with payors are also influenced by competitive pressures. Some of our contracted rates with commercial payors may decrease or we may experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. In addition to downward pressure on contracted commercial payor rates, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on non-contracted or out-of-network providers. In some circumstances for some commercial payors, our centers are designated as out-of-network providers. Rates for out-of-network providers are on average higher than rates for in-network providers. We believe commercial payors have or will begin to restructure their benefits to create disincentives for patients to select or remain with out-of-network providers and to decrease payment rates for out-of-network providers. Decreases in out-of-network rates and restrictions on out-of-network access, our turning away new patients in instances where we are unable to come to agreement on rates, or decreases in contracted rates could result in a significant decrease in our overall revenues derived from commercial payors. If the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, or if we see a decline in commercial patients, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  If the number of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced.  Our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our patients with higher-paying commercial insurance coverage. A patient’s insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons, including changes in the patient’s    50    Table of Contents  or a family member’s employment status. Currently, for a patient covered by an employer group health plan, Medicare generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, or earlier, if the patient’s employer group health plan coverage terminates. When Medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rate we receive for that patient shifts from the employer group health plan rate to the lower Medicare payment rate. We have seen an increase in the number of patients who have government-based programs as their primary payors which we believe is largely a result of improved mortality and recent economic conditions which have a negative impact on the percentage of patients covered under commercial insurance plans. To the extent there are sustained or increased job losses in the U.S., independent of whether general economic conditions might be improving, we could experience a continued decrease in the number of patients covered under commercial plans. We could also experience a further decrease if changes to the healthcare regulatory system result in fewer patients covered under commercial plans or an increase of patients covered under more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates. In addition, our continuous process of negotiations with commercial payors under existing or potentially new agreements could result in a decrease in the number of patients under commercial plans to the extent that we cannot reach agreement with commercial payors on rates and other terms, resulting in termination or non-renewals of existing agreements or our inability to enter into new ones. If there is a significant reduction in the number of patients under higher-paying commercial plans relative to government-based programs that pay at lower rates, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  Changes in the structure of, and payment rates under the Medicare ESRD program, including the Budget Control Act of 2011 and other healthcare reform initiatives, could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  Approximately 49% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was generated from patients who have Medicare as their primary payor. Prior to January 1, 2011, the Medicare ESRD program paid us for dialysis treatment services at a fixed composite rate. The Medicare composite rate was the payment rate for a dialysis treatment including the supplies used in those treatments, specified laboratory tests and certain pharmaceuticals. Certain other pharmaceuticals, including EPO, vitamin D analogs and iron supplements, as well as certain specialized laboratory tests, were separately billed.  In July 2008, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 was passed by Congress. This legislation introduced a new payment system for dialysis services beginning in January 2011 whereby payment for dialysis treatment and related services is now made under a bundled payment rate which provides a fixed rate to encompass all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including pharmaceuticals that were historically separately reimbursed to the dialysis providers, such as EPO, vitamin D analogs and iron supplements, as well as laboratory testing. In August 2010, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published the final rule implementing the bundled payment in the Federal Register. The initial 2011 bundled rate included reductions of 2% from the prior reimbursement and further reduced overall rates by 5.94% tied to an expanded list of case-mix adjustors which can be earned back based upon the presence of certain patient characteristics and co-morbidities at the time of treatment. There are also other provisions which may impact payment including an outlier pool and a low volume facility adjustment.  Another important provision in the law is an annual adjustment, or market basket update, to the base ESRD Prospective Payment Rate, or PPS. Absent action by Congress the PPS base rate will be automatically updated by a formulaic inflation adjustment.  On November 1, 2011, CMS issued the final ESRD PPS rule for 2012, which increased the base rate by 2.1%, representing a market base of increase of 3.0% less a productivity adjustment of 0.9%. The increase in the final base rate for 2012 (2.1%) is slightly greater than the increase of 1.8% stated in the proposed 2012 ESRD PPS rule published in July 2011, and was made irrespective of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, recommendation for a reduced increase. The MedPAC focus on such a reduction indicates further scrutiny of the annual update is possible.    51    Table of Contents On July 11, 2012, CMS issued the proposed ESRD PPS rule for 2013. As currently proposed, the base rate will increase by 2.5%, resulting from a market basket increase of 3.2% less a productivity adjustment of 0.7%. This increase in the ESRD PPS base rate will be reduced by the Budget Control Act of 2011 sequestration, discussed below. The proposed rule implements the reduction in bad debt payments to dialysis facilities (as well as to all other providers eligible for bad debt payments) mandated under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 and adds new quality reporting measures.  The new payment system presents operating, clinical and financial risks. For example, with regard to the expanded list of case-mix adjustors, there is a risk that our dialysis centers or billing and other systems may not accurately document and track the appropriate patient-specific characteristics, resulting in a reduction or overpayment in the amounts of the payments that we would otherwise be entitled to receive.  Beginning January 1, 2014, certain oral-only ESRD drugs (currently paid separately to pharmacies under Medicare Part D) will be included in the ESRD bundled payment to dialysis facilities. CMS delayed the inclusion of these oral only ESRD drugs until 2014 in order to assess how to reimburse for these oral drugs and services. It is currently unclear how CMS will “price” the oral-only drugs for inclusion in the ESRD bundle in 2014. Inadequate pricing could have a significant negative financial impact on our dialysis facilities given the volume and value of these drugs.  We expect to continue experiencing increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in Medicare payment rates or in payments under the new bundled payment rate system.  On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the “Budget Control Act of 2011” (Public Law 112-25), which raised the debt ceiling and put into effect a series of actions to reduce the federal budget deficit over ten years. The law created a Joint Congressional Committee charged with producing legislation reducing federal spending by at least $1.2 trillion. As a result of the committee’s failure to act, the federal government is facing a $1.2 trillion sequester (across-the-board cuts in discretionary programs). In particular, Medicare providers face a maximum of no more than a 2% reduction in reimbursements in fiscal year 2013. However, during the balance of 2012 or sometime in 2013, it is possible that Congress might undertake broad federal entitlements reform that could include significant changes to federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. While we do not know what the extent or the structure of such changes might be or the impact they might have on payments we receive under such programs, any payment reductions beyond those contemplated by the across-the-board cuts pursuant to the sequester could adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  We also cannot predict whether we will be able to comply with the CMS rules related to the bundled payment system as processes and systems are modified substantially to capture all required data. To the extent we are not able to adequately bill and collect for certain payment adjustors and are not able to offset the mandated reductions in reimbursement or if we face regulatory enforcement actions and penalties as a result of alleged improper billing of governmental programs, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. For additional details regarding the risks we face for failing to adhere to our Medicare and Medicaid regulatory compliance obligations, see the risk factor below under the heading “If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows”.  Health care reform could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  In March 2010, broad health care reform legislation was enacted in the U.S. Although many of the provisions of the new legislation do not take effect immediately, and may be modified before they are implemented, the reforms could have an impact on our business in a number of ways. We cannot predict how employers, private payors or persons buying insurance might react to these changes or what form many of these regulations will take before implementation. In March 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services, or    52    Table of Contents  HHS, issued two final rules related to the establishment of health care insurance exchanges due to be operating by 2014 that will provide a marketplace for eligible individuals to purchase health care insurance. The first relates to the standards and requirements applicable to the exchanges, employers and qualified health plans that are marketed in the exchange. The second rule finalizes the provisions governing the risk adjustment program that includes reinsurance, risk corridors and risk adjustment. The final exchange rules clarify the requirements related to implementation of such exchanges, outline areas of state flexibility in their implementation of such exchanges and provide standards for certain risk adjustment mechanisms. We believe the establishment of health care insurance exchanges could result in a reduction in patients covered by commercial insurance or an increase of patients covered through the exchanges under more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates. To the extent that the implementation of such exchanges results in a reduction in patients covered by commercial insurance or a reduction in reimbursement rates for our services from commercial and/or government payors, our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected.  In October 2011, CMS issued a final rule concerning the Medicare Shared Savings Program established by the health care reform legislation, which under the statute was required to be implemented no later than January 1, 2012. The Medicare Shared Savings Program, which is now operational, provides financial incentives to health care providers and suppliers that work together to furnish coordinated, high-quality care to Medicare beneficiaries through accountable care organizations, or ACOs.  The CMS Center for Innovation (Innovation Center) is in various stages of development in working with various healthcare providers to implement ACOs and other innovative models of care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. We are currently uncertain of the extent to which these models of care, including ACOs, Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Initiative (which is scheduled to begin in January 2013), the Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative, the Duals Demonstration, or other models, will impact the health care market. As a provider of dialysis services, we may choose to participate in one or several of these models either as a partner with other providers or independently. We are currently seeking a renal specific coordinated care pilot with the Innovation Center. Even if we do not participate in these programs, some of our patients may be assigned to a pilot, in which case the quality and cost of care that we furnish will be included in an ACOs’ or other programs’ calculations regardless of our participation in the program. As new models of care emerge, we may be at risk for losing our Medicare patient base, which would have a materially adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flow. Furthermore, other initiatives in the government or private sector may arise, including the development of models similar to ACOs, independent practice associations and integrated delivery systems or evolutions of those concepts which could adversely impact our business.  In addition, the health care reform legislation introduced severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from government payors. As a result, we made initial significant investments in additional resources to accelerate the time it takes to identify and process overpayments and we may be required to make additional investments in the future. Acceleration in our ability to identify and process overpayments could result in us refunding overpayments to government or other payors sooner than we have in the past, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows. The failure to return identified overpayments within the specified time frame is now a violation of the federal False Claims Act, or FCA.  The health care reform legislation also reduced the timeline to file Medicare claims, which now must be filed with the government within one calendar year after the date of service. To comply with this reduced timeline, we must deploy significant resources and may change our claims processing methods to ensure that our Medicare claims are filed in a timely fashion. Failure to file a claim within the one year window could result in payment denials, adversely affecting our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  Effective March 2011, CMS instituted new screening procedures and a new $500 enrollment fee for providers enrolling and re-enrolling in government health care programs. A provider is subject to screening upon initial enrollment and each time the provider re-validates its enrollment application. Screening includes verification of enrollment information and review of various federal databases to ensure the provider has valid    53    Table of Contents  tax identification, NPI numbers and is not excluded from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. We expect this screening process to delay the Medicare contractor approval process, potentially causing a delay in reimbursement. The enrollment fee is also applicable upon initial enrollment, re-validation, and each time an existing provider adds a new facility location. This fee is an additional expense that must be paid for each center every three years and could be more significant if other government and commercial payors follow this trend. Ultimately, we anticipate the new screening and enrollment requirements will require additional personnel and financial resources and will potentially delay the enrollment and revalidation of our centers which in turn will delay payment.  Other reform measures allow CMS to place a moratorium on new enrollment of providers and to suspend payment to providers upon a credible allegation of fraud from any source. These types of reform measures, or others, depending upon the scope and breadth of the implementing regulations, could adversely impact our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  There are numerous steps required to implement the broad healthcare reform legislation adopted by Congress, and Congress may seek to alter or eliminate some of the provisions described above. Numerous legal challenges have also been raised to the healthcare reform legislation that could alter or eliminate certain provisions. The United States Supreme Court reviewed state actions challenging the constitutionality of the health insurance mandate and the Medicaid expansion program. The Court upheld the mandate under Congress’ taxing power and upheld the Medicaid expansion program. However, the Court found that the federal government cannot withhold all of a state’s Medicaid funding for the state’s failure or refusal to expand its Medicaid program as contemplated by the reform legislation, effectively leaving the Medicaid expansion decision up to the individual states. Several states have announced they do not intend to expand their Medicaid programs. Further, various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level. There is a considerable amount of uncertainty as to the prospective implementation of the federal healthcare reform legislation and what similar measures might be enacted at the state level. The enacted reforms as well as future legislative changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including lowering our reimbursement rates and increasing our expenses. The health care reform legislation added several new tax provisions that, among other things, impose various fees and excise taxes, and limit compensation deductions for health insurance providers and their affiliates. To date, the IRS has not issued regulations for many of these provisions. In the event that we, or any of our current or future subsidiaries, were to become subject to these rules, our cash flow and tax liabilities could be negatively impacted.  Changes in state Medicaid or other non-Medicare government-based programs or payment rates could reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  Approximately 16% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was generated from patients who have state Medicaid or other non-Medicare government-based programs, such as Medicare-assigned plans or the VA, as their primary coverage. As state governments and governmental organizations face increasing budgetary pressure, we may in turn face reductions in payment rates, delays in the timing of payments, limitations on eligibility or other changes to the applicable programs. For example, some programs, such as certain state Medicaid programs and the VA, have recently considered, proposed or implemented rate reductions.  On December 17, 2010, the Department of Veterans Affairs published a final rule in which it materially changed the payment methodology and ultimately the amount paid for dialysis services furnished to veterans in non-VA centers such as ours. In the final rule, the VA adopted the bundled payment system implemented by Medicare and estimated a reduction of 39% in payments for dialysis services to veterans at non-VA centers. Approximately 2% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was generated by the VA. The new VA payment methodology will have a significant negative impact on our revenues, earnings and cash flows as a result of the reduction in rates or as a result of the decrease in the number of VA patients we serve. We recently executed contractual agreements with the VA and there is some    54    Table of Contents  uncertainty as to when this rule will take effect for the patients covered by these contracts. While at this time the contracts remain in force, these agreements provide for the right of the VA to terminate the agreement without cause on short notice. Further, patients who are not covered by the contractual arrangements will likely be reimbursed at Medicare rates beginning with the date of implementation of the rule. If the VA proceeds with payment rate reductions or fails to renew our existing contracts, we might have to cease accepting patients under this program and could even be forced to close centers.  State Medicaid programs are increasingly adopting Medicare-like bundled payment systems, but sometimes these new payment systems are poorly defined and could include all drugs (even those oral-only drugs that Medicare will not include in the bundled payment until 2014) and are implemented without any claims processing infrastructure, or patient or facility adjusters. If these new payment systems are implemented without any adjusters and claims processing changes, Medicaid payments will be substantially reduced and the costs to submit such claims may increase. In addition, some state Medicaid program eligibility requirements mandate that citizen enrollees in such programs provide documented proof of citizenship. If our patients cannot meet these proof of citizenship documentation requirements, they may be denied coverage under these programs. These Medicaid payment and enrollment changes, along with similar changes to other non-Medicare government programs could reduce the rates paid by these programs for dialysis and related services, delay the timing of payment for services provided, and further limit eligibility for coverage which could adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  Changes in clinical practices, payment rates or regulations impacting EPO and other pharmaceuticals could reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  Historically, Medicare and most Medicaid programs paid for EPO outside of the composite rate. This separate payment has long been the subject of discussions regarding appropriate dosing and payment in an effort to reduce escalating expenditures for EPO. Since January 1, 2011, Medicare has bundled EPO into the prospective payment system such that dosing variations will not change the amount paid to a dialysis facility. Although some Medicaid programs and other payors suggest movement towards a bundled payment system inclusive of EPO, some non-Medicare payors continue to pay for EPO separately from the treatment rate. The administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals that are separately billable accounted for approximately 5% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, with EPO alone accounting for approximately 3% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the same period. Changes in physician clinical practices that result in further decreased utilization of prescribed pharmaceuticals or changes in payment rates for those pharmaceuticals could reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  Since late 2006, there has been significant media discussion and government scrutiny regarding anemia management practices in the U.S. which has created confusion and concern in the nephrology community. In late 2006, the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee held a hearing on the issue of the utilization of ESAs, which include EPO, and in 2007, the FDA required changes to the labeling of EPO and Aranesp® to include a black box warning, the FDA’s strongest form of warning label. An FDA advisory panel on ESA use met in October 2010, which meeting was similar to the prior meeting held in 2007 in that there was significant discussion and concern about the safety of ESAs. The panel concluded it would not recommend a change in ESA labeling. However, the FDA is not bound by the panel’s recommendation. In June 2011, the FDA required that the black box warning be slightly revised and also include more conservative dosing recommendations for patients with chronic kidney disease. In addition, in June 2011, CMS opened a National Coverage Analysis, or NCA, for ESAs. Further in January 2011, CMS convened a meeting of the Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Advisory Committee, or MEDCAC, to evaluate evidence for the pending NCA. In June 2011, CMS determined not to issue a national coverage determination for ESAs due to a lack of available evidence to establish coverage criteria or limitations.  The forgoing congressional and agency activities and related actions could result in further restrictions on the utilization and reimbursement for ESAs. Commercial payors have also increasingly examined their    55    Table of Contents  administration policies for EPO and, in some cases, have modified those policies. Further changes in labeling of EPO and other pharmaceuticals in a manner that alters physician practice patterns or accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental payment criteria, including the introduction of EPO administration policies or the conversion to alternate types of administration of EPO or other pharmaceuticals that result in further decreases in utilization of EPO for patients covered by commercial payors or increased utilization of EPO for patients for whom the cost of EPO is included in a bundled reimbursement rate, or further decreases in reimbursement for EPO and other pharmaceuticals that are not included in a bundled reimbursement rate, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  Changes in EPO pricing could materially reduce our earnings and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients.  In November 2011, we entered into a seven year Sourcing and Supply Agreement with Amgen USA Inc. Under the agreement we committed to purchase EPO in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of our requirements for erythropoiesis stimulating agents. The agreement replaces in its entirety the prior one-year supply agreement between us and Amgen that expired on December 31, 2011. As long as certain conditions are met by us, the agreement limits Amgen’s ability to unilaterally decide to increase the price for EPO. Future increases in the cost of EPO without corresponding increases in payment rates for EPO from commercial payors and without corresponding increases in the Medicare bundled rate could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows and ultimately reduce our income. Our agreement with Amgen for EPO provides for discounted pricing and rebates for EPO. Some of the rebates are subject to various conditions including but not limited to future pricing levels of EPO by Amgen and data submission by us. In addition, the rebates are subject to certain limitations. We cannot predict whether, over the seven year term of the agreement, we will continue to receive the rebates for EPO that we have received in the past, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of rebates within that structure as we have historically achieved. In the initial years of the agreement, however, the total rebate opportunity is less than what was provided in the agreement that expired at the end of 2011, however, the opportunity for us to earn discounts and rebates increases over the term of the agreement. Factors that could impact our ability to qualify for rebates provided for in our agreement with Amgen in the future include, but are not limited to, our ability to track certain data elements. We cannot predict whether we will be able to meet the applicable qualification requirements for receiving rebates. Failure to meet certain targets and earn the specified rebates could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.  We are the subject of a number of inquiries by the federal government and two private civil suits, any of which could result in substantial penalties or awards against us, imposition of certain obligations on our practices and procedures, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and, in certain cases, criminal penalties.  We are the subject of a number of inquiries by the federal government. We have received subpoenas or other requests for documents from the federal government in connection with the 2005 U.S. Attorney investigation, the Woodard private civil suit, the Vainer private civil suit, the 2010 U.S. Attorney physician relationship investigation, the 2011 U.S. Attorney physician relationship investigation and the 2011 U.S. Attorney Medicaid investigation. Certain current and former members of the Board and executives have been subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury in Colorado related to the 2011 U.S. Attorney physician relationship investigation. The Company has received additional subpoenas for documents, and a number of other individuals have received subpoenas to testify before the grand jury. (See Part I, Item 3, of this report under the caption “Legal Proceedings” for additional details regarding these matters). After investigation, the government did not intervene and is not actively pursuing either the Woodard or the Vainer private civil suits mentioned above. In each of these private civil suits, a relator filed a complaint against us in federal court under the qui tam provisions of the FCA pursued the claims independently. The parties are engaged in active litigation in the Vainer private civil suit. In the Woodward private civil suit, though we have reached an agreement in principle to settle all allegations relating to claims arising out of this suit, it is still subject to the parties being able to enter into a mutually acceptable settlement agreement and receive the requisite approval of the federal government and the    56    Table of Contents  court to fully and finally resolve this matter. We are cooperating with the OIG and those offices of the U.S. Attorney still actively pursuing the matters mentioned above and are producing the requested records. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated by the federal government, the scope of such proceedings or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time through the various phases of document and witness requests and on-going discussions with regulators. Responding to the subpoenas or investigations and defending ourselves in the private civil suit will continue to require management’s attention and significant legal expense. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties or awards against us, imposition of certain obligations on our practices and procedures, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and, in certain cases, criminal penalties. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated by the federal government against us at this time.  Continued inquiries from various governmental bodies with respect to our utilization of EPO and other pharmaceuticals will require management’s attention, cause us to incur significant legal expense and could result in substantial financial penalties against us, repayment obligations or exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  In response to clinical studies which identified risks in certain patient populations related to the utilization of EPO and other ESAs, i.e., Aranesp®, and in response to changes in the labeling of EPO and Aranesp®, there has been substantial media attention and government scrutiny resulting in hearings and legislation regarding pharmaceutical utilization and reimbursement. Although we believe our anemia management practices and other pharmaceutical administration practices have been compliant with existing laws and regulations, as a result of the current high level of scrutiny and controversy, we may be subject to increased inquiries from a variety of governmental bodies and claims by third parties. Additional inquiries from or audits by various agencies and claims by third parties with respect to these issues would continue to require management’s attention and significant legal expense and any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties or repayments, imposition of certain obligations on our practices and procedures and the attendant financial burden on us to comply, or exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings, cash flows and stock price.  Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations, federal and state anti-kickback laws, the Stark Law physician self-referral prohibition and analogous state referral statutes, Federal Acquisition Regulations, the FCA and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information and the storage, handling and administration of pharmaceuticals. The Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules related to claims submission, enrollment and licensing requirements, cost reporting, and payment processes impose complex and extensive requirements upon dialysis providers. A violation or departure from any of these requirements may result in government audits, lower reimbursements, significant fines and penalties, the potential loss of certification and recoupments or voluntary repayments.  The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers continues to increase. For example, CMS has indicated that after implementation of the Medicare bundled payment system, it will monitor the use of EPO and other pharmaceuticals. In addition, Medicare has increased the frequency and intensity of its certification inspections of dialysis centers. For example, we are required to provide substantial documentation related to the administration of pharmaceuticals, including EPO, and, to the extent that any such documentation is found insufficient, we may be required to refund to government or commercial payors any amounts received for such administration, and be subject to substantial penalties under applicable laws or regulations. In addition, Medicare contractors have increased their prepayment and post-payment reviews.    57    Table of Contents We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid payments, to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with state and federal anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral law (Stark Law), and for storing, handling and administering pharmaceuticals. However, the laws and regulations in these areas are complex, require considerable resources to monitor and implement and are subject to varying interpretations. For example, if an enforcement agency were to challenge the level of compensation that we pay our medical directors or the number of medical directors whom we engage, we could be required to change our practices, face criminal or civil penalties, pay substantial fines or otherwise experience a material adverse effect as a result of a challenge to these arrangements. In addition, amendments to the FCA impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from government payors. These amendments could subject our procedures for identifying and processing overpayments to greater scrutiny. We have made significant investments in additional resources to decrease the time it takes to identify and process overpayments and we may be required to make additional investments in the future. An acceleration in our ability to identify and process overpayments could result in us refunding overpayments to government or other payors sooner than we have in the past. A significant acceleration of these refunds could have a material adverse affect on our operating cash flows. Additionally, amendments to the federal anti-kickback statute in the health reform law make anti-kickback violations subject to FCA prosecution, including qui tam or whistleblower suits.  If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings, cash flows and stock price, including:        •    Suspension or termination of our participation in government payment programs;        •    Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable payment program requirements;        •    Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government payment programs;        •    Loss of licenses required to operate health care facilities or administer pharmaceuticals in some of the states in which we operate;        •    Reductions in payment rates or coverage for dialysis and ancillary services and related pharmaceuticals;        •    Fines, damages or monetary penalties for anti-kickback law violations, Stark Law violations, FCA violations, civil or criminal liability based on violations of law, or other failures to meet regulatory requirements;        •    Enforcement actions by governmental agencies and/or claims for monetary damages by patients who believe protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws, including the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA);        •    Mandated changes to our practices or procedures that significantly increase operating expenses;        •    Imposition of and compliance with Corporate Integrity Agreements that could subject us to ongoing audits, reporting, increased scrutiny of our billing and business practices and potential additional fines;        •    Termination of relationships with medical directors; and        •    Harm to our reputation, which could impact our business relationships, ability to obtain financing and access to new opportunities.  Delays in state Medicare and Medicaid certification of our dialysis centers could adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  Before we can begin billing for patients treated in our outpatient dialysis centers who are enrolled in government-based programs, we are required to obtain state and federal certification for participation in the    58    Table of Contents  Medicare and Medicaid programs. As state agencies responsible for surveying dialysis centers on behalf of the state and Medicare program face increasing budgetary pressure, certain states are having difficulty keeping up with certifying dialysis centers in the normal course resulting in significant delays in certification. If state governments continue to have difficulty keeping up with certifying new centers in the normal course and we continue to experience significant delays in our ability to treat and bill for services provided to patients covered under government programs, it could cause us to incur write-offs of investments or accelerate the recognition of lease obligations in the event we have to close centers or our centers’ operating performance deteriorates, and it could have an adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  If our joint ventures were found to violate the law, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  As of September 30, 2012, we owned a controlling interest in numerous dialysis-related joint ventures, which represented approximately 19% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. In addition, we also owned minority equity investments in several other dialysis related joint ventures. We anticipate that we will continue to increase the number of our joint ventures. Many of our joint ventures with physicians or physician groups also have the physician owners providing medical director services to those centers or other centers we own and operate. Because our relationships with physicians are governed by the federal anti-kickback statute, we have sought to structure our joint venture arrangements to satisfy as many safe harbor requirements as we believe are reasonably possible. However, our joint venture arrangements do not satisfy all elements of any safe harbor under the federal anti-kickback statute (and possibly the Stark Law). The subpoena and related requests for documents we received from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri in the 2005 U.S. Attorney investigation, the OIG’s Office in Dallas in the 2010 U.S. Attorney physician relationship investigation and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado in the 2011 U.S. Attorney physician relationship investigation, included requests for documents related to our joint ventures. We were advised by the U.S. Department of Justice that it is conducting civil and grand jury investigations into our financial relationships with physicians.  If our joint ventures are found to be in violation of the anti-kickback statute or the Stark Law provisions, we could be required to restructure the joint ventures or refuse to accept referrals for designated health services from the physicians with whom the joint venture centers have a financial relationship.  We also could be required to repay amounts received by the joint ventures from Medicare and certain other payors to the extent that these arrangements are found to give rise to prohibited referrals, and we could be subject to monetary penalties, exclusion from government healthcare programs and, if criminal proceedings are brought against us, criminal penalties. If our joint venture centers are subject to any of these penalties, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of dialysis revenues and related refund liabilities that we recognize and if we are unable to accurately estimate our revenues and related refund liabilities, it could impact the timing and the amount of our revenues recognition or have a significant impact on our operating results.  There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of dialysis and related lab services revenues and related refund liabilities that we recognize in a reporting period. The billing and collection process is complex due to ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for approximately 150,000 U.S. patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverage that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. Errors in determining the correct coordination of benefits may result in refunds to payors. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are also subject to estimating risk related to the amounts not paid by the primary government payor that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage, the    59    Table of Contents  patient’s commercial health plan secondary coverage or the patient. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of revenues for the segment, which can represent as much as 6% of consolidated operating income. If our estimates of dialysis and related lab services revenues and related refund liabilities are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing and the amount of our revenues recognition and have a significant impact on our operating results.  The ancillary services we provide or the strategic initiatives, including our international dialysis operations, that we invest in now or in the future may generate losses and may ultimately be unsuccessful. In the event that one or more of these activities is unsuccessful, we may have to write off our investment and incur other exit costs.  Our ancillary services and strategic initiatives currently include pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs, physician services and our international dialysis operations. We expect to add additional service offerings and pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future as circumstances warrant, which could include healthcare services not related to dialysis. Many of these initiatives require or would require investments of both management and financial resources and can generate significant losses for a substantial period of time and may not become profitable. There can be no assurance that any such strategic initiative will ultimately be successful. Any significant change in market conditions, or business performance, or in the political, legislative or regulatory environment, may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives. For example, during 2011 and 2010, several of our strategic initiatives generated net operating losses and some are expected to generate net operating losses in 2012. If any of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives, including our international dialysis operations, do not perform as planned, we may incur a material write-off or an impairment of our investment, including goodwill, in one or more of these activities or we could incur significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business. As an example, during the second quarter of 2011 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $24 million related to a decrease in the implied fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount associated with our infusion therapy business.  If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  We believe that physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical director of the center. As a result, the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. Neither our current nor former medical directors have an obligation to refer their patients to our centers. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, and a new medical director is appointed, it may negatively impact the former medical director’s decision to treat his or her patients at our center. If we are unable to enforce noncompetition provisions contained in the terminated medical director agreements, former medical directors may choose to provide medical director services for competing providers or establish their own dialysis centers in competition with ours. Also, if the quality of service levels at our centers deteriorates, it may negatively impact patient referrals and treatment volumes.  Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally three to ten years, and at any given time a large number of them could be up for renewal at the same time. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us, and there are a number of factors, including opportunities presented by our competitors or different affiliation models in the changing healthcare environment, such as an increase in the number of physicians becoming employed by hospitals, that could negatively impact their decisions to extend their agreements with us. In addition, we may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships to assure compliance with the anti-kickback statute, Stark Law and other similar laws. These actions also could negatively impact the decision of physicians to extend their medical    60    Table of Contents  director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us. If the terms of any existing agreement are found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship which could lead to the early termination of the agreement, or cause the physician to stop referring patients to our dialysis centers. If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced.  Current economic conditions as well as further disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.  Current economic conditions could adversely affect our business and our profitability. Among other things, the potential decline in federal and state revenues that may result from such conditions may create additional pressures to contain or reduce reimbursements for our services from Medicare, Medicaid and other government sponsored programs. Increasing job losses or slow improvement in the unemployment rate in the U.S. as a result of current or recent economic conditions has and may continue to result in a smaller percentage of our patients being covered by an employer group health plan and a larger percentage being covered by lower paying Medicare and Medicaid programs. Employers may also begin to select more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates. To the extent that payors are negatively impacted by a decline in the economy, we may experience further pressure on commercial rates, a further slowdown in collections and a reduction in the amounts we expect to collect. In addition, uncertainty in the financial markets could adversely affect the variable interest rates payable under our credit facilities or could make it more difficult to obtain or renew such facilities or to obtain other forms of financing in the future, if at all. Any or all of these factors, as well as other consequences of the current economic conditions which cannot currently be anticipated, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.  We may engage in acquisitions, mergers or dispositions, including the merger between the Company and HealthCare Partners Holdings, LLC (the HCP transaction), which may affect our results of operations, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of our business.  We may engage in acquisitions or mergers including the HCP transaction or dispositions, which may affect our results of operations, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures, or other aspects of our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or merger partners or that, if identified, we will be able to acquire these targets on acceptable terms or agree to terms with merger partners. There can also be no assurance that we will be successful in completing any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or integrating any acquired business into our overall operations or operate them successfully as stand-alone businesses, or that any such acquired business will operate profitably or will not otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. Further, we cannot be certain that key talented individuals at the business being acquired will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will be able to continue to successfully manage or have adequate resources to successfully operate any acquired business.  HCP operates in a different line of business from our historical business and the HCP transaction is significantly larger than any other acquisition we have made to date. Upon consummation of the HCP transaction, we may face challenges managing HCP as a new business and may not realize anticipated benefits.  The HCP transaction is the largest acquisition we have attempted to date and will result in our being significantly engaged in a new line of business. Upon entering into a new line of business, we may not have the expertise, experience, and resources to pursue all of our businesses at once, and we may be unable to successfully operate the businesses. The administration of the businesses will require implementation of appropriate operations, management, and financial reporting systems and controls. We may experience difficulties in effectively implementing these and other systems. The management of HCP will require the focused attention of our management team, including a significant commitment of its time and resources. The need for management to focus on these matters could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues and operating results. If the HCP operations are less profitable than we currently anticipate or we do not have the experience, the appropriate    61    Table of Contents  expertise, or the resources to pursue all businesses in the combined company, the results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.  Upon consummation of the HCP transaction, if we fail to successfully integrate HCP into our internal control over financial reporting or if the current internal control of HCP over financial reporting were found to be ineffective, the integrity of our and/or HCP’s financial reporting could be compromised which could result in a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.  As a private company, HCP has not been subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to internal control over financial reporting, and for a period of time after the consummation of the HCP transaction our management evaluation and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting will be permitted to exclude the operations of HCP. The integration of HCP into our internal control over financial reporting will require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and will increase our compliance costs. If we fail to successfully integrate these operations into our internal control over financial reporting, our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately report our financial results and the market’s perception of our business and our stock price. In addition, if HCP’s internal control over financial reporting were found to be ineffective, the integrity of HCP’s past financial reporting could be adversely impacted.  Under the accounting rules applicable to the contingent consideration relating to the HCP transaction, we must determine the fair value of the contingent consideration on a quarterly basis, which could result in our recording changes in the fair value as an expense in our financial statements, and any such expense may have an adverse impact on our earnings and our ability to predict the amount of earnings.  A portion of the consideration for the HCP transaction is contingent upon HCP’s performance following the closing of the HCP transaction. The accounting rules applicable to the contingent consideration require that we determine the fair value of the contingent consideration on a quarterly basis. To the extent that the fair value in any quarter exceeds the prior quarter’s determination, we will be required to record the increase in fair value as an expense in our financial statements. Any such expense will reduce our net income in the quarter in which it is recognized. These requirements will also limit our ability to predict our earnings in the quarters in which we must assess the fair value of the contingent consideration, and have not been included in any of our existing earnings guidance.  The market price of our common stock after consummation of the HCP transaction may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of our common stock currently.  Our historical business differs substantially from that of HCP. Accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of our common stock after consummation of the HCP transaction may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of the Company and HCP.  If we are not able to continue to make acquisitions, or maintain an acceptable level of non-acquired growth, or if we face significant patient attrition to our competitors or a reduction in the number of our medical directors, it could adversely affect our business.  The dialysis industry is highly competitive, particularly in terms of acquiring existing dialysis centers. We continue to face increased competition in the U.S. dialysis industry from large and medium-sized providers which compete directly with us for acquisition targets as well as for individual patients and medical directors. In addition, as we continue our international dialysis expansion into various international markets, we will face competition from large and medium-sized providers for these acquisition targets as well. Acquisitions, patient retention and medical director retention are an important part of our growth strategy. Because of the ease of entry into the dialysis business and the ability of physicians to be medical directors for their own centers, competition for growth in    62    Table of Contents  existing and expanding markets is not limited to large competitors with substantial financial resources. Occasionally, we have experienced competition from former medical directors or referring physicians who have opened their own dialysis centers. In addition, Fresenius, our largest competitor, manufactures a full line of dialysis supplies and equipment in addition to owning and operating dialysis centers. This may give it cost advantages over us because of its ability to manufacture its own products. If we are not able to continue to make acquisitions, continue to maintain acceptable levels of non-acquired growth, or if we face significant patient attrition to our competitors or a reduction in the number of our medical directors, it could adversely affect our business.  If businesses we acquire have liabilities that we are not aware of, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our earnings and cash flows.  Our business strategy includes the acquisition of dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers, as well as other ancillary and non-dialysis services and strategic initiatives, including the HCP transaction. Businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities or liabilities that are in excess of the amounts that we originally estimated. Although we generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire for matters that are not properly disclosed to us, we are not always successful. In addition, even in cases where we are able to obtain indemnification, we may discover liabilities greater than the contractual limits or the financial resources of the indemnifying party. In the event that we are responsible for liabilities substantially in excess of any amounts recovered through rights to indemnification, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our earnings and cash flows.  HCP will become a subsidiary of the Company upon consummation of the HCP transaction. If HCP’s liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are unknown HCP obligations, our business could be materially and adversely affected.  Upon consummation of the HCP transaction, HCP will become a subsidiary of the Company and HCP’s liabilities, including contingent liabilities, will be consolidated with the Company’s. We may learn additional information about HCP’s business that adversely affects the Company, such as unknown liabilities, issues relating to internal controls over financial reporting or issues that could affect our ability to comply with other applicable laws, including healthcare laws and regulations. As a result, we cannot make any assurances that the HCP transaction will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. Among other things, if HCP’s liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are obligations of HCP of which we are not aware at the time of consummation of the HCP transaction, our business could be materially and adversely affected.  We have limited indemnification rights in connection with matters affecting HCP. HCP may also have other unknown liabilities for which we will be responsible after consummation of the HCP transaction. If we are responsible for liabilities not covered by indemnification rights or substantially in excess of amounts covered through any indemnification rights, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  Expansion of our operations to and offering our services in markets outside of the U.S. subjects us to political, economical, legal, operational and other risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.  We are continuing an expansion of our operations by offering our services outside of the U.S., which increases our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets. Depending on the market, these risks include, without limitation, those relating to:        •    changes in the local economic environment;        •    political instability, armed conflicts or terrorism;        •    social changes;    63    Table of Contents     •    intellectual property legal protections and remedies;        •    trade regulations;        •    procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services;        •    foreign currency;        •    repatriating or moving to other countries cash generated or held abroad, including considerations relating to tax-efficiencies and changes in tax laws;        •    export controls;        •    lack of reliable legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights;        •    changes in local laws or regulations;        •    potentially longer ramp-up times for starting up new operations and for payment and collection cycles;        •    financial and operational, and information technology systems integration; and        •    failure to comply with U.S. or local laws that prohibit us or our intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international business and operations will be different than those affecting our domestic business and operations. For example, conducting international operations requires us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets, to comply with local laws and regulations and to overcome the numerous new challenges inherent in managing international operations, including those based on differing languages, cultures and regulatory environments, and those related to the timely hiring, integration and retention of a sufficient number of skilled personnel in an environment with which we are not familiar to carry out operations.  We anticipate expanding our international operations through acquisitions of varying sizes or through organic growth, which could increase these risks. Additionally, though we might invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs in connection with the growth and development of our international operations, there is no assurance that we will be able to operate them profitably anytime soon, if at all. As a result, we would expect these costs to be dilutive to our earnings over the next several years as we start-up or acquire new operations.  These risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business and our ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness depends on many factors beyond our control.  We have substantial debt outstanding, we are incurring a substantial amount of additional debt in connection with the HCP transaction and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The high level of our indebtedness, among other things, could:        •    make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt securities;        •    increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;        •    require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;        •    limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;    64    Table of Contents     •    place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and        •    limit our ability to borrow additional funds.  Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts, including any strategic acquisitions we may make in the future, will depend on our ability to generate cash. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. The borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by a substantial portion of our direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a substantial portion of DaVita’s and its guarantors’ assets.  We are incurring substantial additional indebtedness to finance the consummation of the HCP transaction and we may not be able to meet our substantial debt service requirements.  We are incurring substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the HCP transaction. If we are unable to generate sufficient funds to meet our obligations or the new debt financing entered into to consummate the HCP transaction otherwise becomes due and payable, we may be required to refinance, restructure, or otherwise amend some or all of such obligations, sell assets, or raise additional cash through the sale of our equity. We cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such refinancing on terms as favorable as our current anticipated financing or that such restructuring activities, sales of assets, or issuances of equity can be accomplished or, if accomplished, would raise sufficient funds to meet these obligations.  Increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness.  A portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates. We are subject to LIBOR-based interest rate volatility from a floor of 1.50% to a cap of 4.00% on $1,250 million notional amounts of our Term Loan B outstanding debt as a result of several interest rate cap agreements that were entered into in January 2011. The remaining $469 million of outstanding debt on the Term Loan B is subject to LIBOR-based interest rate volatility above a floor of 1.50%. At September 30, 2012, we were also subject to LIBOR-based interest rate volatility above a floor of 1.00% on $198 million of outstanding debt associated with our Term Loan A-2.  We also have approximately $350 million of additional borrowings available of which approximately $88 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit, under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities that are subject to LIBOR-based interest rate volatility. We may also incur additional variable rate debt in the future. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense of the variable portion of our indebtedness, which could negatively impact our earnings and cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness which would be particularly significant in the event of rapid and substantial increases in interest rates.  At September 30, 2012, if interest rates were to hypothetically increase by 100 basis points it would increase our interest expense by approximately $0.5 million, which increase solely relates to our Term Loan A-2 that is subject to LIBOR-based interest rate volatility above a floor of 1.00%.  However, interest expense would not be impacted by any LIBOR-based interest rate volatility associated with our other Term Loans since all of our Term Loan A is economically fixed and our Term Loan B is subject to LIBOR-based interest rate volatility above a floor of 1.50%, as described above. The current LIBOR rate in effect, plus a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points, is currently less than our Term Loan B floor of 1.50%. Therefore, LIBOR-based interest rates would have to increase above a floor of 1.50% for the Term Loan B to    65    Table of Contents  have a negative impact on our financial results. See “Item 3—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for more information.  If there are shortages of skilled clinical personnel or if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses.  We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. We compete for nurses with hospitals and other health care providers. This nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations. In addition, changes in certification requirements or increases in the required staffing levels for skilled clinical personnel can impact our ability to maintain sufficient staff levels to the extent our teammates are not able to meet new requirements or competition for qualified individuals increases. If we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, or if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for our skilled clinical personnel, our operations and treatment growth will be negatively impacted, which would result in reduced revenues, earnings and cash flows.  Our business is labor intensive and could be adversely affected if we were unable to maintain satisfactory relations with our employees or if union organizing activities were to result in significant increases in our operating costs or decreases in productivity.  Our business is labor intensive, and our results are subject to variations in labor-related costs, productivity and the number of pending or potential claims against us related to labor and employment practices. If political efforts at the national and local level result in actions or proposals that increase the likelihood of union organizing activities at our facilities or if union organizing activities increase for other reasons, or if labor and employment claims, including the filing of class action suits, trend upwards, our operating costs could increase and our employee relations, productivity, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected.  Upgrades to our billing and collections systems and complications associated with upgrades and other improvements to our billing and collections systems could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and operating results.  We are continuously performing upgrades to our billing systems and expect to continue to do so in the near term. In addition, we continuously work to improve our billing and collections performance through process upgrades, organizational changes and other improvements. We may experience difficulties in our ability to successfully bill and collect for services rendered as a result of these changes, including a slow-down of collections, a reduction in the amounts we expect to collect, increased risk of retractions from and refunds to commercial and government payors, an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts receivable and noncompliance with reimbursement regulations. The failure to successfully implement the upgrades to the billing and collection systems and other improvements could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and operating results.  Our ability to effectively provide the services we offer could be negatively impacted if certain of our suppliers are unable to meet our needs or if we are unable to effectively access new technology, which could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  We have significant suppliers that are either the sole or primary source of products critical to the services we provide, including Amgen, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, NxStage Medical, Inc. and others or to which we have committed obligations to make purchases including Gambro Renal Products and Fresenius. If any of these suppliers are unable to meet our needs for the products they supply, including in the event of a product recall, or shortage, and we are not able to find adequate alternative sources, or if some of the drugs that we purchase are not reimbursed or not adequately reimbursed by commercial payors or through the bundled payment rate by Medicare, our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be substantially reduced. In addition, the technology related to the products critical to the services we provide is subject to new developments and may result in    66    Table of Contents  superior products. If we are not able to access superior products on a cost-effective basis or if suppliers are not able to fulfill our requirements for such products, we could face patient attrition which could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  We may be subject to liability claims for damages and other expenses not covered by insurance that could reduce our earnings and cash flows.  The administration of dialysis and related services to patients, and the management of our operations, may subject the Company, as well as its officers and directors to whom the Company owes certain defense and indemnity obligations to litigation and liability for damages. Our business, profitability and growth prospects could suffer if we face negative publicity or we pay damages or defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope or limits of coverage of any applicable insurance coverage, including claims related to adverse patient events, contractual disputes, professional and general liability, and directors’ and officers’ duties. In addition, we have received several notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties related to our historical billing practices and the historical billing practices of the centers acquired from Gambro Healthcare and other matters related to their settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted, an adverse result with respect to one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We currently maintain insurance coverage for those risks we deem are appropriate to insure against and make determinations about whether to self-insure as to other risks or layers of coverage. However, a successful claim, including a professional liability, malpractice or negligence claim which is in excess of any applicable insurance coverage, or that is subject to our self-insurance retentions, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.  In addition, if our costs of insurance and claims increase, then our earnings could decline. Market rates for insurance premiums and deductibles have been steadily increasing. Our earnings and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following:        •    the collapse or insolvency of our insurance carriers;        •    further increases in premiums and deductibles;        •    increases in the number of liability claims against us or the cost of settling or trying cases related to those claims; and        •    an inability to obtain one or more types of insurance on acceptable terms, if at all.  Provisions in our charter documents, compensation programs and Delaware law may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests.  Our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent; requiring 90 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors; and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval.  Most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We also maintain a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock awards, which has been in place since 2001, and which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the market price of our common stock and shares outstanding on September 30, 2012, these cash bonuses would total approximately $388 million if a change of control transaction occurred at that price and our Board of Directors did not modify this program. These change of control provisions may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay for our Company.    67    Table of Contents We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law that, subject to exceptions, would prohibit us from engaging in any business combinations with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder.  These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company at a price that our stockholders may find attractive. These provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.
