Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 for a more detailed description of this business risk.) ABSG’s business may continue to be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the Medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals, especially oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs. Since ABSG provides a number of services to or through physicians, any further changes affecting this service channel could result in additional revenue reductions.   Other   Other revenue increased $139.0 million and $357.5 million from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively, primarily due to the incremental revenue contributions from World Courier, which was acquired in April 2012. We expect Other revenue to increase between 30% and 35% in fiscal 2013 primarily due to the inclusion of World Courier’s revenue for a full fiscal year.   Gross Profit              Three months ended               Six months ended                         March 31,               March 31,                 (dollars in thousands)       2013       2012       Change       2013       2012       Change         Gross profit       $   716,989       $   679,741       5.5%       $   1,377,817       $   1,253,003       10.0%                              Gross profit increased $37.2 million and $124.8 million from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively. These increases were primarily due to the incremental contributions made by our fiscal 2012 acquisition of World Courier and the growth of our non-oncology specialty distribution businesses. These increases were offset in part by the lower gross profit related to the Express Scripts contract, the loss of a food and drug retail GPO customer, the lower number of generic launches, and the reduced contribution from the sales of certain specialty oncology drugs. We also recognized gains of $3.5 million and $15.8 million from    19      Table of Contents   antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers during the quarter and six month period ended March 31, 2013, respectively. The gains were recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold. There were no gains from antitrust litigation settlements in the prior year quarter or six month period.   As a percentage of revenue, our gross profit margin of 3.49% in the quarter ended March 31, 2013 increased 4 basis points from the prior year quarter. As a percentage of revenue, our gross profit margin of 3.31% in the six months ended March 31, 2013 increased 15 basis points from the prior year period. The gross profit margin increases were due to the gross profit contributions from our fiscal 2012 acquisition of World Courier and the above-mentioned gains from antitrust litigation settlements, both of which were offset in part by the lower gross profit margin related to the current Express Scripts contract, the loss of a food and drug retail GPO customer, and competitive pressures on customer margins.   Our cost of goods sold for interim periods includes a last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) provision that is based on our estimated annual LIFO provision. The annual LIFO provision, which we estimate on a quarterly basis, is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences.   As a result of the March 2013 Walgreens contract announcement, we have initiated procedures to understand and analyze the amount of branded inventory that we will be required to purchase and warehouse prior to September 1, 2013 to properly service this new customer contract. We expect to complete our analysis during the third fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2013. When we update our estimate of our annual LIFO provision as of June 30, 2013, it is likely that our estimate of the annual provision will change materially because the additional branded inventory that we will be required to purchase to service the Walgreens contract will significantly change our branded inventory quantities, and therefore increase our annual inflation index due to our branded versus generic inventory mix. Cumulatively, three quarters of the estimated annual LIFO expense will be recorded in our third fiscal quarter.

Depreciation expense increased from the prior year periods due to our fiscal 2012 acquisition of World Courier and due to an increase in capital projects. Amortization expense increased from the prior-year periods due to our fiscal 2012 acquisition of World Courier.   Warrant expense was $3.8 million in the quarter and six months ended March 31, 2013. The Warrants were issued in March 2013 in connection with the agreements and arrangements that define our strategic relationship with Walgreens and Alliance Boots. Refer to the Recent Developments on page 16 for a more detailed description of the Warrants. Future Warrant expense could fluctuate significantly.   20      Table of Contents   Employee severance, litigation and other for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 included the reversal of $5.1 million of employee severance costs, offset by $4.2 million of deal-related transaction costs, and $0.6 million of facility closure and other costs. Employee severance, litigation and other for the six months ended March 31, 2013 included $4.7 million of deal-related transaction costs, $2.9 million of facility closure and other costs, offset by a reversal of $5.9 million of severance costs that were initially recorded in connection with fiscal 2012 initiatives. As a result of the recently announced Walgreens ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement, we terminated a significant portion of our previously planned fiscal 2012 initiatives. Employee severance, litigation and other for the prior year quarter included $6.1 million of employee severance costs and $2.9 million of deal-related transaction costs. The six months ended March 31, 2012 included $6.1 million of employee severance costs and $6.5 million of deal-related transaction costs.   As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 1.79% in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, an increase of 25 basis points from the prior year quarter. For the six months ended March 31, 2013, operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, were 1.75%, up 26 basis points from the prior year six-month period. These increases were primarily due to the addition of our fiscal 2012 World Courier acquisition, which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. For the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, as a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were down 3 basis points from the prior year quarter and down 4 basis points from the prior year six-month period.   Operating Income              Three months ended               Six months ended                         March 31,               March 31,                 (dollars in thousands)       2013       2012       Change       2013       2012       Change         Pharmaceutical Distribution       $   328,635       $   362,363       -9.3%       $   609,520       $   639,719       -4.7%         Other       24,950       23,724       5.2%       45,509       33,330       36.5%         Warrants       (3,761   )   —               (3,761   )   —                 Employee severance, litigation and other       299       (9,027   )           (1,705   )   (12,586   )             Operating income       $   350,123       $   377,060       -7.1%       $   649,563       $   660,463       -1.7%          Segment operating income is evaluated before Warrant expense and employee severance, litigation and other.   Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income decreased $33.7 million and $30.2 million from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively. The 23 basis point decline in operating margin from the prior year quarter and 14 basis point decline from the prior year six-month period are due to decreased contributions from generic launches, a shift in customer mix towards lower margin business in ABDC (most notably the Express Scripts contract), the loss of a food and drug retail GPO customer, and a decline in the operating margin of our oncology business. Other operating income increased $1.2 million from the prior year quarter due to the contribution made by our World Courier acquisition, offset in part by the decrease in operating income from our ABCS businesses. Other operating income increased $12.2 million from the prior year six-month period due to the contribution made by our World Courier acquisition and an increase in operating income from our ABCS businesses.   21      Table of Contents   Interest expense, interest income, and the respective weighted average interest rates in the quarters ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows (in thousands):              2013       2012                 Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate       Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate         Interest expense       $   18,647       4.67%       $   24,045       4.86%         Interest income       (137   )   0.29%       (670   )   0.25%         Interest expense, net       $   18,510               $   23,375                  Interest expense decreased from the prior year quarter due to a decrease of $392.7 million in average borrowings primarily due to the repayment of our $392 million, 5 5/8% senior notes in September 2012.   Interest expense, interest income, and the respective weighted average interest rates in the six months ending March 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows (in thousands):              2013       2012                 Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate       Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate         Interest expense       $   37,384       4.68%       $   46,535       4.94%         Interest income       (349   )   0.32%       (874   )   0.21%         Interest expense, net       $   37,035               $   45,661                  Interest expense decreased from the prior year six-month period due to a decrease of $287.0 million in average borrowings, primarily due to the repayment of our $392 million, 5 5/8% senior notes in September 2012, offset in part by the issuance of our $500 million 3 1/2% senior notes in November 2011.   Income taxes in the quarter ended March 31, 2013 reflect an effective income tax rate of 38.3%, compared to 38.1% in the prior year quarter. Income taxes in the six months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 reflect an effective income tax rate of 38.1%. We expect that our effective tax rate in fiscal 2013 will be approximately 38.2%.   Income from continuing operations of $204.1 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2013 decreased 6.8% from the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.87 in the quarter ended March 31, 2013 increased 3.6% from $0.84 per share in the prior year quarter. Income from continuing operations of $378.8 million in the six months ended March 31, 2013 decreased 0.5% from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.61 in the six months ended March 31, 2013 increased 11.0% from $1.45 in the prior year period. The difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the changes in income from continuing operations for the quarter and six months ended March 31, 2013 were due to the 10.6% and 10.4% reduction, respectively, in weighted average common shares outstanding, primarily from purchases of our common stock, net of the impact of stock option exercises.   Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for all periods presented represents the operating results of AndersonBrecon and AmerisourceBergen Canada Corporation, as well as a goodwill impairment charge and estimated loss on disposal associated with AmerisourceBergen Canada Corporation recorded in the quarter and six months ended March 31, 2013.   22      Table of Contents   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The following table illustrates our debt structure at March 31, 2013, including availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility, the receivables securitization facility and the revolving credit note (in thousands):              Outstanding Balance       Additional Availability         Fixed-Rate Debt:                         $500,000, 5 7/8% senior notes due 2015       $   499,232       $   —         $400,000, 4 7/8% senior notes due 2019       397,650       —         $500,000, 3 1/2% senior notes due 2021       499,390       —                                   Total fixed-rate debt       1,396,272       —                                   Variable-Rate Debt:                         Multi-currency revolving credit facility due 2017       —       681,489         Receivables securitization facility due 2015       —       700,000         Revolving credit note       —       45,000         Other       —       1,520                                   Total variable-rate debt       —       1,428,009         Total long-term debt       $   1,396,272       $   1,428,009          Along with our cash balances, our aggregate availability under our multi-currency revolving credit facility, our receivables securitization facility and the revolving credit note provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements.   We have a $700 million multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in October 2016, (the “Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders. In November 2012, we entered into an amendment with the syndicate of lenders to extend the maturity date of the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility to November 2017. Interest on borrowings under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from 68 basis points to 155 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee, as applicable (90 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee at March 31, 2013). Additionally, interest on borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the Canadian prime rate or the CDOR rate. We pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on our debt rating, ranging from 7 basis points to 20 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (10 basis points at March 31, 2013). We may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales, which we are compliant with as of March 31, 2013.   We have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $700 million at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at March 31, 2013.   We have a $700 million receivables securitization facility (“Receivables Securitization Facility”), which was scheduled to expire in October 2014. In November 2012, we entered into an amendment to the Receivables Securitization Facility to extend the maturity date to November 2015. We have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables   23        Table of Contents   Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are currently based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or LIBOR plus a program fee of 75 basis points. We currently pay an unused fee of 37.5 basis points, annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. At March 31, 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility.   We have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note (“Revolving Credit Note”) from Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania for an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $45 million. The line of credit provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $45 million at any time outstanding.   We have $500 million of 5 7/8% senior notes due September 15, 2015 (the “2015 Notes”), $400 million of 4 7/8% senior notes due November 15, 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) and $500 million of 3 1/2% senior notes due November 15, 2021 (the “2021 Notes”). Interest on the 2015 Notes, the 2019 Notes, and the 2021 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears. All of the senior notes rank pari passu to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility.   Our operating results have generated cash flow, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and repurchases of shares of our common stock.   Our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund repurchases of our common stock, fund the payment of dividends, finance acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. In May 2012, our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. During the quarter ended December 31, 2012, we purchased $96.9 million of our common stock to complete our authorization under the $750 million share repurchase program. In November 2012, our board of directors approved a new program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. During the quarter ended December 31, 2012, we purchased $187.6 million of our common stock under the new share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2013, we had $562.4 million of availability remaining on the new $750 million share repurchase program. We currently expect to purchase $400 million of our common stock in fiscal 2013, subject to market conditions. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements.   If Walgreens and/or Alliance Boots exercise their rights to purchase our common stock pursuant to the Warrants that we issued to them, the future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the Warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We are considering one or more hedge strategies that would partially offset the impact of this potential dilution. We believe that we have sufficient capital resources to fund the cost of the hedge strategies we are considering.   Deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers. In addition, volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth, our profitability, and our cash flow from operations.   We have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt. We manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. At March 31, 2013, our continuing operations had no variable-rate debt outstanding. The amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. We periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us. There were no such financial instruments in effect at March 31, 2013.   24      Table of Contents   We also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents. We had $1,347.3 million in cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2013, $414.0 million of which was invested in money market accounts at financial institutions. The unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable-rate debt. For every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable-rate debt, a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million.   We are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-U.S. operations. Our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the Canadian Dollar, the U.K. Pound Sterling, and the Euro. We may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates. Such contracts generally have durations of less than one year. We had no foreign currency denominated forward contracts at March 31, 2013. We may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes.   Following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at March 31, 2013 (in thousands):              Payments Due by Period                 Total       Within 1 Year       1-3 Years       4-5 Years       After 5 Years         Debt, including interest payments       $   1,777,288       $   66,634       $   618,581       $   83,073       $   1,009,000         Operating leases       298,982       54,403       92,542       64,880       87,157         Other commitments       152,619       83,653       68,471       495       —         Total       $   2,228,889       $   204,690       $   779,594       $   148,448       $   1,096,157          We have commitments to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers through the 2014/2015 flu season. We are required to purchase doses at prices that we believe will represent market prices. We currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately $62.9 million as of March 31, 2013, of which $37.7 million represents our commitment over the next twelve months. These influenza vaccine commitments are included in “Other commitments” in the above table.   We have outsourced to IBM Global Services (“IBM”) a significant portion of our corporate and ABDC information technology activities. The remaining commitment under our 10-year arrangement, as amended, which expires in June 2015, is approximately $71.0 million as of March 31, 2013, of which $32.7 million represents our commitment over the next twelve months, and is included in “Other commitments” in the above contractual obligations table.   Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $49.4 million (including interest and penalties) as of March 31, 2013. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table.   During the six months ended March 31, 2013, our operating activities provided $743.7 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of $668.1 million in the prior year period. Cash provided by operations during the six months ended March 31, 2013 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of $378.8 million, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and income taxes of $766.5 million, and non-cash items of $141.4 million, offset, in part, by an increase in accounts receivable of $417.6 million and an increase in merchandise inventories of $174.5 million. Accounts receivable increased from September 30, 2012, reflecting the increased volume associated with our current Express Scripts contract, and was offset in part by strong customer cash collections. Additionally, while the payment terms in the current Express Scripts contract are favorable, they are longer than the payment terms in the previous Medco contract. As a result, there was a negative impact on our working capital in the current year    25      Table of Contents   six months ended March 31, 2013. We also increased our merchandise inventories at March 31, 2013 to support the increase in volume due to the current Express Scripts contract. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of payments to our suppliers.   We use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. The increase in days sales outstanding from the prior year quarter reflects the payment terms under the current Express Scripts contract.              Quarter ended March 31,       Six months ended March 31,                 2013       2012       2013       2012         Days sales outstanding       18.7       17.8       18.6       17.5         Days inventory on hand       27.2       24.7       26.4       24.9         Days payable outstanding       45.4       42.1       44.0       41.7          Our cash flow from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based on fluctuations in our period end working capital. We expect cash from operating activities in fiscal 2013 to be between $320 million and $420 million. Operating cash uses during the six months ended March 31, 2013 included $34.5 million of interest payments and $182.2 million of income tax payments, net of refunds.   During the six months ended March 31, 2012, our operating activities provided $668.1 million of cash. Cash provided by operations during the six months ended March 31, 2012 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of $380.7 million, a decrease in merchandise inventories of $322.8 million, non-cash items of $119.3 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $97.1 million, and a decrease in prepaid and other assets of $56.7 million, offset, in part, by a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes of $234.5 million. Accounts receivable declined from September 30, 2011, reflecting timing of customer purchases and payments as of March 31, 2012. The decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the timing of inventory purchases made and the related payments to our suppliers. Operating cash uses during the six months ended March 31, 2012 included $37.5 million of interest payments and $130.0 million of income tax payments, net of refunds.   Capital expenditures for the six months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 were $88.4 million and $63.5 million, respectively. Significant capital expenditures in the six months ended March 31, 2013 included the purchase of one of our leased distribution facilities, technology initiatives including costs related to the further development of our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system, and expansion costs related to one of ABDC’s facilities. We expect to spend at least $220 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2013. Significant capital expenditures in the six months ended March 31, 2012 related to our Business Transformation project, which included a new ERP system for our corporate office and for our ABDC operations, ABDC purchases of machinery and equipment and other ABCS facility expansions and improvements.   In November 2011, we acquired TheraCom for a purchase price of $257.2 million, net of a working capital adjustment. Additionally, we finalized working capital adjustments relating to our September 2011 acquisitions of IntrinsiQ, LLC and Premier Source totaling $0.5 million, net.   In November 2011, we issued our 2021 Notes for net proceeds of $494.8 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2021 Notes for general corporate purposes.   During the six months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, we paid $284.7 million and $328.5 million, respectively, for purchases of our common stock shares.   In November 2011, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 13% from $0.115 per share to $0.13 per share. In November 2012, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 62% from $0.13 per share to $0.21 per    26      Table of Contents   share. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remains within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   The Company’s most significant market risks are the effects of changing interest rates and foreign currency risk. See the discussion under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 2 on page 24.   ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. These controls and procedures also are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.   The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of other members of the Company’s management, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a — 15(e) and 15d — 15(e) under the Exchange Act) and have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for their intended purposes as of the end of the period covered by this report.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There were no changes during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2013 in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, those controls.   28      Table of Contents   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings   See Note 8 (Legal Matters and Contingencies) of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth under Item 1 of Part I of this report for the Company’s current description of legal proceedings.   Item 1A. Risk Factors   The Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 included a detailed discussion of our risk factors under Part I, “Item 1A — Risk Factors.” Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012.   The suspension or revocation by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution facilities to purchase, store and distribute controlled substances or the refusal by the DEA to issue a registration to any such facility that requires such registration may adversely affect our reputation, our business and our results of operations.   The DEA, United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and various state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards, and comply with the Controlled Substance Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding and distribution of controlled substances. Government authorities may from time to time investigate whether we are in compliance with various security and operating standards applicable to the distribution of controlled substances, including whether we are adequately detecting and preventing the illegal diversion of controlled substances. We have received, and may in the future receive, requests for information and subpoenas from the DEA, various U.S. Attorneys’ Offices of the U.S. Department of Justice, and/or state regulatory agencies related to our distribution of controlled substances or our order monitoring program, which is designed to prevent or detect the illegal diversion of controlled substances.   The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend our distribution centers’ licenses to distribute pharmaceutical products (including controlled substances), seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.   If Walgreen Co. (“Walgreens”) and/or Alliance Boots GmbH (“Alliance Boots”) exercise their rights to purchase our common stock pursuant to the warrants that we issued to them, the future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.   In connection with our strategic relationship with Walgreens and Alliance Boots, we entered into a Framework Agreement with Walgreens and Alliance Boots, dated as of March 18, 2013 (the “Framework Agreement”), pursuant to which (i) Walgreens and Alliance Boots together were granted the right to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen, beginning with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase up to 19,859,795 shares of our common stock (approximately 7% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issuance, assuming the exercise in full of the Warrants described below) in open market transactions, with the right to designate up to two members of our board of directors upon achieving specified ownership levels; (ii) Walgreens Pharmacy Strategies, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Walgreens, was issued (a) a warrant to purchase up to 11,348,456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share exercisable during a six-month period beginning in March 2016, and (b) a warrant to purchase up to 11,348,456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share exercisable during a six-month period beginning in March 2017; and (iii) Alliance Boots Luxembourg S.à.r.l., a wholly owned subsidiary of Alliance Boots, was issued (a) a warrant to purchase up to 11,348,456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share exercisable during a six-month period beginning in March 2016 and (b) a warrant to purchase up to 11,348,456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share exercisable during a six-month period beginning in March 2017 (collectively, the “Warrants”). The Warrants collectively represent approximately 16% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issuance, assuming   29        Table of Contents   exercise in full of the Warrants. The number of shares which may be purchased in the open market is subject to increase in certain circumstances if the market price of our common stock is less than the exercise price of the first tranche of Warrants when those Warrants are exercisable in 2016. In such event, the incremental number of shares purchased in the open market would reduce share-for-share the number of shares exercisable pursuant to the first tranche of Warrants.   Future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the Warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders. In addition, the dilutive effect of the Warrants will be reflected in our diluted earnings per share during the period that the Warrants are outstanding. A decrease in our diluted earnings per share could, in turn, adversely affect the market value of our common stock. In addition, any sales in the public market of any common stock acquired pursuant to open market purchases by Walgreens and Alliance Boots or issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.   Problems with the transition of Walgreens’ business to us, our performance under the distribution agreement, and/or a disruption in our relationship with Walgreens could adversely affect our business and financial results.   In March 2013, we entered into a ten-year distribution agreement with Walgreens to act as its primary wholesale distribution source with respect to branded and generic prescription drugs. This agreement, when fully implemented, will significantly expand our relationship with Walgreens, to which we currently distribute specialty pharmacy products to substantially all of its stores. Beginning September 1, 2013, this agreement provides for us to become the supplier of Walgreens’ branded prescription drugs. Beginning in calendar year 2014, Walgreens will, over time, move the supply of its generic prescription drug business to us. In order to transition the business, we will utilize unused capacity in our distribution network and will leverage prior investments in our new enterprise resource planning system. In the event there are any unanticipated delays, costs, fees, charges, expenses, capital expenditures or disruption of our business or operations relating to our transition to becoming the single branded and generic prescription drug wholesaler to Walgreens could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.   In addition, our business may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that Walgreens experiences, including any disruptions of certain of Walgreens’ existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the DEA and/or state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies. If Walgreens’ operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether by natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory or governmental action or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability.   If our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, we may have an obligation to pay or credit Walgreens for failure to supply products. In addition, upon the expiration or termination of the agreement, there can be no assurance that we or Walgreens will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement, on terms favorable to us or at all.   The anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with Walgreens may not be realized.   We entered into the arrangement with Walgreens and Alliance Boots with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including, among other things, growth in our revenues, earnings and earnings per share, cost savings and operating efficiencies, innovation and sharing of best practices. We currently anticipate earnings accretion from the agreement for fiscal year 2014, excluding any expenses related to the Warrants, certain non-recurring costs, and certain start-up expenses. This expectation is based on our preliminary estimates, which may materially change. The processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex, costly and time-consuming. Many of the anticipated benefits and expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. Achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including: the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations, processes or initiatives, or the inability to realize potential benefits, including cost savings, innovations, or benefits resulting from participation in Walgreens Boots Alliance Development, GmbH, a global sourcing joint venture between Walgreens and Alliance Boots; the transition of Walgreens’ prescription drug distribution to us; the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of this strategic arrangement, including any disruption of our cash flow and ability to return value to our stockholders in accordance with our past practices and any reduction in our operational, strategic or financial flexibility; the potential disruption resulting from vendor, payor and customer reaction to the strategic transaction and potential changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms; unexpected or unforeseen costs, fees, expenses and charges incurred by us related to the transaction    30      Table of Contents   or the overall strategic relationship; and whether the unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner.   In addition, Walgreens and Alliance Boots have the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the Framework and Shareholder Agreements to invest in our common stock. We could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances, or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the Framework and Shareholder Agreements. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and the price of our common stock.
