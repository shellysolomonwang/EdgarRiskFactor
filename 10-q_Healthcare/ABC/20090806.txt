ITEM 1A.   Risk Factors    The Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 included a detailed discussion of our risk factors under Part I, “Item 1A — Risk Factors.” The information presented below sets forth material changes from the risk factors described in the 2008 Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and information described in the 2008 Form 10-K and the Company’s filings with the SEC since the date of the 2008 Form 10-K.  The enactment of provincial legislation or regulations in Canada to lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees may adversely affect our pharmaceutical distribution business in Canada, including the profitability of that business.  As in the United States, our products and services function within the existing regulatory structure of the healthcare system in Canada. The purchase of pharmaceutical products in Canada is funded in part by the provincial governments, which each regulate the financing and reimbursement of drugs independently. In recent years, like the United States, the Canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. For example, in 2006, the Ontario government enacted the Transparent Drug System for Patients Act, which significantly revised the drug distribution system in Ontario. Then in July 2009, the Ontario government announced that it was undertaking a review of that legislation with a view to, among other things, lower costs for taxpayers. Some of these potential changes, such as adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing the drug distribution supply chain, prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits or a reduction in government funding for certain healthcare services may result in lower service fees, cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. Legislation and/or regulations that may lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees are reportedly under consideration by some other provinces as well. We expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability in Canada.   38                  ITEM 2.
