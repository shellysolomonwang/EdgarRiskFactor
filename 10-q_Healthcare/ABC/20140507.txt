Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 for a more detailed description of this business risk.) ABSG’s business may continue to be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the Medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals, especially oncology drugs administered by physicians. Since ABSG provides a number of services to or through physicians, any changes affecting this service channel could result in additional revenue reductions.   A number of our contracts with customers or group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) are typically subject to expiration each year. We may lose a significant customer or GPO relationship if any existing contract with such customer or GPO expires without being extended, renewed, or replaced. During the six months ended March 31, 2014, no significant contracts expired. Over the next twelve months, the only significant contract scheduled to expire is our contract with the Department of Defense (“DOD”), which expires in March 2015. Our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows will be negatively impacted if the DOD contract is not renewed or the terms of the renewed contract are less favorable than the existing contract.   Other   Revenue in Other increased 11.2% and 15.4% from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively, primarily due to our TheraCom distribution business within ABCS, which benefited from the launch of two new products in the middle of the prior fiscal year, and increased revenue from World Courier.   Gross Profit              Three months ended               Six months ended                         March 31,               March 31,                 (dollars in thousands)       2014       2013       Change       2014       2013       Change         Pharmaceutical Distribution       $   695,202       $   587,693       18.3%       $   1,289,408       $   1,115,826       15.6%         Other       136,370       125,625       8.6%       266,948       247,179       8.0%         Gains on antitrust litigation settlements       849       3,456               21,872       15,764                 LIFO (expense) credit        (102,828   )   215               (160,410   )   (952   )             Gross profit       $   729,593       $   716,989       1.8%       $   1,417,818       $   1,377,817       2.9%          Gross profit increased 1.8%, or $12.6 million, and 2.9%, or $40.0 million, from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively.   Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit increased 18.3%, or $107.5 million, and 15.6%, or $173.6 million, from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively. These increases were primarily due to the higher sales volume to Walgreens, brand price appreciation, and the growth of our non-community oncology specialty distribution businesses. As a percentage of revenue, Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit margin of 2.49% and 2.28% in the quarter and six months ended March 31, 2014 decreased 44 basis points and 46 basis points from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively. These declines were primarily due    17      Table of Contents   to a significant increase in lower margin brand business with Walgreens and some of our other larger customers and competitive pressures on customer margins.   Gross profit in Other increased 8.6%, or $10.7 million, and 8.0%, or $19.8 million, from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively. These increases were primarily due to higher revenue and improved gross margin in World Courier and higher revenue in TheraCom’s distribution business. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in Other of 23.82% in the quarter ended March 31, 2014 decreased from 24.40% in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in Other of 22.69% in the six months ended March 31, 2014 decreased from 24.23% in the prior year six month period. These decreases were primarily due to increases in TheraCom’s distribution revenue, which has a lower gross profit margin in comparison to other businesses within Other. These decreases were offset, in part, by increases in the gross profit margin of World Courier.   We recognized gains of $0.8 million and $3.5 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers during the quarters ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We recognized gains of $21.9 million and $15.8 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers during the six months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold.   Our cost of goods sold for interim periods includes a last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) provision that is based on our estimated annual LIFO provision. We recorded a LIFO expense of $102.8 million and a LIFO credit of $0.2 million in the quarters ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our LIFO expense was $160.4 million and $1.0 million in the six months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The annual LIFO provision, which we estimate on a quarterly basis, is affected by expected changes in inventory quantities (such as the inventory build for the Walgreens business), product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual LIFO provision.   Operating Expenses              Three months ended               Six months ended                         March 31,               March 31,                 (dollars in thousands)       2014       2013       Change       2014       2013       Change         Distribution, selling and administrative       $   376,341       $   323,536       16.3%       $   740,401       $   644,236       14.9%         Depreciation and amortization       44,494       39,868       11.6%       88,444       78,552       12.6%         Warrants       5,663       3,761               121,960       3,761                 Employee severance, litigation and other       1,967       (299   )           6,269       1,705                 Total operating expenses       $   428,465       $   366,866       16.8%       $   957,074       $   728,254       31.4%          Distribution, selling and administrative expenses increased 16.3%, or $52.8 million, from the prior year quarter, and increased 14.9%, or $96.2 million from the prior year six-month period, primarily due to the on-boarding of our distribution agreement with Walgreens. More specifically, expenses relating to payroll, information technology and delivery were higher in the current year quarter and six month period.   Depreciation expense increased from the prior year periods due to an increase in the amount of capital projects being depreciated. Amortization expense was comparable to the prior year periods.   Warrant expense was $5.7 million and $122.0 million in the quarter and six month period ended March 31, 2014, respectively, compared to $3.8 million in both the prior year quarter and six month period. The Warrants were issued in March 2013 in connection with the agreements and arrangements that define our strategic relationship with Walgreens and Alliance Boots. Future    18      Table of Contents   Warrant expense could fluctuate significantly. (Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Warrants” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 for a more detailed description of the accounting for the Warrants.)   Employee severance, litigation and other for the quarter ended March 31, 2014 included $3.5 million of deal-related transaction costs offset in part by the net reversal of $1.5 million of employee severance and other costs. Employee severance, litigation and other for the six months ended March 31, 2014 included $5.7 million of deal-related transaction costs and $0.6 million of employee severance and other costs. Employee severance, litigation and other for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 included the reversal of $5.1 million of employee severance costs, offset by $4.2 million of deal-related transaction costs, and $0.6 million of facility closure and other costs. Employee severance, litigation and other for the six months ended March 31, 2013 included $4.7 million of deal-related transaction costs and $2.9 million of facility closure and other costs, offset by the reversal of $5.9 million of employee severance costs.   As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 1.51% in the quarter ended March 31, 2014, a decrease of 28 basis points from the prior year quarter. For the six months ended March 31, 2014, operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, were 1.66%, down 9 basis points from the prior year six month period. These decreases were primarily due to economies of scale as a result of the increased revenue provided by the Walgreens distribution agreement. The decrease in the six months ended March 31, 2014 was offset, in part, by the larger Warrant expense in the current year period.   Operating Income              Three months ended               Six months ended                         March 31,               March 31,                 (dollars in thousands)       2014       2013       Change       2014       2013       Change         Pharmaceutical Distribution       $   372,929       $   321,077       16.1%       $   659,711       $   587,754       12.2%         Other       43,633       34,935       24.9%       79,583       64,660       23.1%         Total segment operating income       416,562       356,012       17.0%       739,294       652,414       13.3%         Gains on antitrust litigation settlements       849       3,456               21,872       15,764                 LIFO (expense) credit       (102,828   )   215               (160,410   )   (952   )             Acquisition related intangibles amortization       (5,825   )   (6,098   )           (11,783   )   (12,197   )             Warrants       (5,663   )   (3,761   )           (121,960   )   (3,761   )             Employee severance, litigation and other       (1,967   )   299               (6,269   )   (1,705   )             Operating income       $   301,128       $   350,123       -14.0%       $   460,744       $   649,563       -29.1%          Segment operating income is evaluated before gains on antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO (expense) credit; acquisition related intangibles amortization; Warrants; and employee severance, litigation and other.   Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income increased 16.1%, or $51.9 million, and 12.2%, or $72.0 million, from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively, due to the increases in gross profit, offset in part by the increases in operating expenses. As a percentage of revenue, Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income margin declined 26 basis points from the prior year quarter and declined 28 basis points from the prior year six month period due to a significant increase in lower margin brand business with Walgreens and some of our other larger customers.   19      Table of Contents   Operating income in Other increased 24.9%, or $8.7 million, and 23.1%, or $14.9 million, from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively, primarily due to the increase in gross profit of World Courier.   Interest expense, interest income, and the respective weighted average interest rates in the quarters ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (in thousands):              2014       2013                 Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate       Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate         Interest expense       $   19,577       3.85%       $   18,647       4.67%         Interest income       (103   )   0.50%       (137   )   0.29%         Interest expense, net       $   19,474               $   18,510                  Interest expense increased 5.2%, or $1.0 million, from the prior year quarter due to an increase of $338.2 million in variable rate average borrowings to fund seasonal working capital needs and the on-boarding of the Walgreens business.   Interest expense, interest income, and the respective weighted average interest rates in the six months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (in thousands):              2014       2013                 Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate       Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate         Interest expense       $   38,621       4.23%       $   37,384       4.68%         Interest income       (315   )   0.48%       (349   )   0.32%         Interest expense, net       $   38,306               $   37,035                  Interest expense increased 3.4%, or $1.3 million, from the prior year six month period due to an increase of $167.9 million in variable rate average borrowings.   Income taxes in the quarter ended March 31, 2014 reflect an effective income tax rate of 36.9%, compared to 38.3% in the prior year quarter. Income taxes in the six months ended March 31, 2014 reflect an effective tax rate of 46.3%, compared to 38.1% in the prior year period. The fluctuations in our effective tax rate were primarily the result of quarterly changes in the valuation of the Warrants for financial reporting purposes. Our future effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly depending upon the quarterly valuation of the Warrants for financial reporting purposes. Excluding the impact of Warrant expense, we expect that our effective tax rate in fiscal 2014 will be in the low 38% range.   Income from continuing operations of $180.1 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2014 decreased 11.8% from the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.76 in the quarter ended March 31, 2014 decreased 12.6% from $0.87 per share in the prior year quarter. Income from continuing operations of $229.0 million in the six months ended March 31, 2014 decreased 39.5% from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.97 in the six months ended March 31, 2014 decreased 39.8% from $1.61 in the prior year period.   Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for all periods presented includes the operating results of AndersonBrecon (“AB”) and AmerisourceBergen Canada Corporation (“ABCC”), as well as a goodwill impairment charge and estimated loss on sale of ABCC in the quarter and six months ended March 31, 2013.   20      Table of Contents   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The following table illustrates our debt structure at March 31, 2014, including availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility, the receivables securitization facility and the revolving credit note (in thousands):              Outstanding Balance       Additional Availability         Fixed-Rate Debt:                         $500,000, 5 7/8% senior notes due 2015       $   499,526       $   —         $400,000, 4 7/8% senior notes due 2019       397,960       —         $500,000, 3 1/2% senior notes due 2021       499,462       —         Total fixed-rate debt       1,396,948       —                                   Variable-Rate Debt:                         Multi-currency revolving credit facility due 2018       —       1,400,000         Receivables securitization facility due 2016       —       950,000         Revolving credit note       —       45,000         Total variable-rate debt       —       2,395,000         Total debt       $   1,396,948       $   2,395,000          Along with our cash balances, our aggregate availability under our multi-currency revolving credit facility, our receivables securitization facility and the revolving credit note provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements. We have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the December and March quarters that, depending on our cash balance, can require the use of our credit facilities to fund short-term capital needs. Our cash balances in the six months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 needed to be supplemented by intra-period credit facility borrowings to cover seasonal short-term working capital needs, which were higher in the six months ended March 31, 2014 due to the on-boarding of the Walgreens business. The greatest amount of variable-rate debt outstanding at any one time during the six months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 was $1.1 billion and $595.0 million, respectively. The $16.1 billion and $2.3 billion of cumulative intra-period borrowings during the six months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were fully repaid by the end of each respective reporting period.   We have a $1.4 billion multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in July 2018, (the “Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders. Interest on borrowings under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from 68 basis points to 130 basis points over LIBOR / EURIBOR / Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee, as applicable (90 basis points over LIBOR / EURIBOR / Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee at March 31, 2014). Additionally, interest on borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the Canadian prime rate or the CDOR rate. We pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on our debt rating, ranging from 7 basis points to 20 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (10 basis points at March 31, 2014). We may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales, which we are compliant with as of March 31, 2014.   We have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $1.4 billion at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program does   21      Table of Contents   not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at March 31, 2014.   We have a $950 million receivables securitization facility (“Receivables Securitization Facility”), which is scheduled to expire in June 2016. We have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. During December 2013, we increased the availability of the Receivables Securitization Facility by $250 million under the accordion feature. During March 2014, we elected to decrease the availability of the Receivables Securitization Facility back to $950 million. Interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or LIBOR plus a program fee of 75 basis points. We pay an unused fee of 40 basis points, annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, which we are compliant with as of March 31, 2014.   We have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note (“Revolving Credit Note”). The Revolving Credit Note provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $45 million. In April 2014, we entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Note to increase its maximum capacity to $75 million. The Revolving Credit Note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice.   We have $500 million of 5 7/8% senior notes due September 15, 2015 (the “2015 Notes”), $400 million of 4 7/8% senior notes due November 15, 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) and $500 million of 3 1/2% senior notes due November 15, 2021 (the “2021 Notes”). Interest on the 2015 Notes, the 2019 Notes, and the 2021 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears. All of the senior notes rank pari passu to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility.   Our operating results have generated cash flow, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and repurchases of shares of our common stock.   Our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund repurchases of our common stock, fund the payment of dividends, finance acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. In November 2012, our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, we purchased $387.0 million of our common stock under the share repurchase program. During the six months ended March 31, 2014, we purchased $269.8 million of our common stock under the share repurchase program, which included $18.0 million of purchases that settled after March 31, 2014. As of March 31, 2014, we had $93.2 million of availability remaining on the $750 million share repurchase program. In August 2013, our board of directors approved a new program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million additional shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. We currently expect to purchase $500 million of our common stock in fiscal 2014, subject to market conditions. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements.   If Walgreens and/or Alliance Boots exercise their rights to purchase our common stock pursuant to the Warrants that we issued to them, the future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the Warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have taken steps to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect that exercise of the Warrants could have by hedging a portion of our future obligation to deliver common stock with a financial institution and repurchasing additional shares of our common stock for our own account over time. We will continue to explore additional opportunities to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the Warrants. In June 2013, we commenced our hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which it has executed a series of issuer capped call transactions (“Capped Calls”). The Capped Calls give us the right to buy 60% of the shares of our common stock subject to the Warrants at specified prices at maturity, should the Warrants be exercised in 2016 and 2017 and assuming our future share price does not exceed the “cap” price in the Capped Calls. If our share price exceeds the “cap” price in the Capped Calls at the time the Warrants   22      Table of Contents   are exercised, the number of shares that will be delivered to us under the Capped Calls will be reduced, and accordingly, will cover less than 60% of the shares of common stock subject to the Warrants. If our future share price at the exercise dates is lower than our breakeven share price, then our use of capital for the purchase of the Capped Calls would be ineffective. To the extent the Capped Calls do not mitigate the dilutive effect of the Warrants, we intend to consider repurchasing additional shares of our common stock. The amount of dilution that we would be able to mitigate will depend on the relative costs and benefits of such a transaction, considering factors such as: our financial performance, the current and future share price of our common stock, our expected cash flows, competing priorities for capital, and overall market conditions.   We completed this hedge transaction in January 2014. During the six months ended March 31, 2014, we purchased Capped Calls on 11.9 million shares of our common stock for a total premium of $211.4 million, which included a $6.1 million payment for a hedge premium accrued at September 30, 2013. In total, under this hedge transaction, we purchased Capped Calls on 27.2 million shares of our common stock for a total premium of $368.7 million.   Deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers. In addition, volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth, our profitability, and our cash flow from operations.   We have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt. We manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. At March 31, 2014, we had no variable-rate debt outstanding. The amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. We periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us. There were no such financial instruments in effect at March 31, 2014.   We also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents. We had $696.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2014. The unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable-rate debt. For every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable-rate debt, a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million.   We are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-U.S. operations. Our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, and the U.K. Pound Sterling. We may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates. We may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes. As of March 31, 2014, we had one foreign currency denominated contract outstanding that hedges the foreign currency exchange risk of the C$50.0 million note that we received in conjunction with the sale of ABCC in May 2013.   Changes in the price and volatility of our common stock may have a significant impact on the fair value of the Warrants issued to Walgreens and Alliance Boots (see Note 6). As of March 31, 2014, a one dollar change in our common stock, holding other assumptions constant, would increase or decrease the fair value of the Warrants by approximately $35 million and a one percent change in volatility, holding other assumptions constant, would increase or decrease the fair value of the Warrants by approximately $14 million.   23      Table of Contents   Following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at March 31, 2014 (in thousands):              Payments Due by Period                 Total       Within 1 Year       1-3 Years       4-5 Years       After 5 Years         Debt, including interest payments       $   1,701,063       $   66,375       $   588,688       $   74,000       $   972,000         Operating leases       291,938       56,692       94,170       67,069       74,007         Other commitments       101,865       65,848       36,017       —       —         Total       $   2,094,866       $   188,915       $   718,875       $   141,069       $   1,046,007          We have commitments to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers through the 2015/2016 flu season. We are required to purchase doses at prices that we believe will represent market prices. We currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately $50.3 million as of March 31, 2014, of which $25.2 million represents our commitment over the next twelve months, and are included in “Other commitments” in the above table.   We have outsourced to IBM Global Services (“IBM”) a significant portion of our corporate and ABDC information technology activities. The remaining commitment under our 10-year arrangement, as amended, which expires in June 2015, is approximately $38.3 million as of March 31, 2014, of which $30.7 million represents our commitment over the next twelve months, and is included in “Other commitments” in the above table.   Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $58.7 million (including interest and penalties) as of March 31, 2014. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table.   During the six months ended March 31, 2014, our operating activities provided $112.7 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of $743.7 million in the prior year period. Cash provided by operations during the six months ended March 31, 2014 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of $229.0 million, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and income taxes of $1.6 billion, and non-cash items of $231.6 million, offset, in part, by an increase in merchandise inventories of $1.5 billion and an increase in accounts receivable of $495.5 million. Accounts receivable increased from September 30, 2013, reflecting the increased volume associated with our new Walgreens business. We also increased our merchandise inventories at March 31, 2014 to support the increase in volume due to the new Walgreens business and consistent with prior years, due to seasonal needs. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories.   24      Table of Contents   We use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. The increase in days sales outstanding from the prior year quarter and six month period reflects the increased sales volume and payment terms under the Walgreens distribution contract.              Quarter ended March 31,       Six months ended March 31,                 2014       2013       2014       2013         Days sales outstanding       20.5       18.7       20.3       18.6         Days inventory on hand       29.3       27.2       28.1       26.4         Days payable outstanding       45.5       45.4       43.9       44.0          Our cash flow from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based on fluctuations in our period end working capital. We expect cash from operating activities in fiscal 2014 to be between $800 million and $1.0 billion. Operating cash uses during the six months ended March 31, 2014 included $34.2 million of interest payments and $72.3 million of income tax payments, net of refunds.   During the six months ended March 31, 2013, our operating activities provided $743.7 million of cash. Cash provided by operations during the six months ended March 31, 2013 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of $378.8 million, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and income taxes of $766.5 million, and non-cash items of $141.4 million, offset, in part, by an increase in accounts receivable of $417.6 million and an increase in merchandise inventories of $174.5 million. Accounts receivable increased from September 30, 2012, reflecting the increased volume associated with our largest pharmacy benefit manager (“PBM”) customer contract, which became effective on October 1, 2012, and was offset in part by strong customer cash collections. Additionally, while the payment terms in the PBM customer contract are favorable, they are longer than the payment terms in the previous contract. As a result, there was a negative impact to our working capital in the six months ended March 31, 2013. We also increased our merchandise inventories at March 31, 2013 to support the increase in volume due to the PBM customer contract. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of payments to our suppliers.   Capital expenditures for the six months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were $125.4 million and $88.4 million, respectively. Significant capital expenditures in the six months ended March 31, 2014 included infrastructure and technology-related costs to on-board the incremental Walgreens distribution volume, costs associated with building our new national distribution center, and other technology initiatives, including costs related to the further development of our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. We expect to spend approximately $300 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2014. Significant capital expenditures in the six months ended March 31, 2013 included the purchase of one of our leased distribution facilities, technology initiatives including costs related to the further development of our ERP system, and expansion costs related to one of ABDC’s facilities.   During the six months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, we paid $252.0 million and $284.7 million, respectively, for purchases of our common stock. During the six months ended March 31, 2014, we paid $211.4 million to purchase Capped Calls to hedge the potential dilution associated with the Warrants upon their exercise.   In November 2012, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 62% from $0.13 per share to $0.21 per share. In November 2013, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 12% from $0.21 per share to $0.235 per share. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remains within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors.   25      Table of Contents   Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   Certain of the statements contained in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
