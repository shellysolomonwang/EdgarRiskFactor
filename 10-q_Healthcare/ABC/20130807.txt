Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 for a more detailed description of this business risk.) ABSG’s business may continue to be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the Medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals, especially oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs. Since ABSG provides a number of services to or through physicians, any further changes affecting this service channel could result in additional revenue reductions.   A number of our contracts with customers or group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) are typically subject to expiration each year. We may lose a significant customer or GPO relationship if any existing contract with such customer or GPO expires without being extended, renewed, or replaced. During the nine months ended June 30, 2013, no significant contracts expired. Over the next twelve months, there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire.   Other   Other revenue increased $69.3 million and $426.8 million from the prior year quarter and nine-month period, respectively, primarily due to the incremental revenue contributions from World Courier, which was acquired in April 2012. We expect Other revenue to increase between 30% and 35% in fiscal 2013 primarily due to the inclusion of World Courier’s revenue for a full fiscal year.   19      Table of Contents   Gross Profit              Three months ended               Nine months ended                         June 30,               June 30,                 (dollars in thousands)       2013       2012       Change       2013       2012       Change         Pharmaceutical Distribution       $   443,412       $   579,841       -23.5%       $   1,590,633       $   1,751,878       -9.2%         Other       119,038       88,025       35.2%       349,634       168,991       106.9%         Gross profit       $   562,450       $   667,866       -15.8%       $   1,940,267       $   1,920,869       1.0%          Gross profit decreased 15.8%, or approximately $105.4 million, and increased 1.0%, or approximately $19.4 million, from the prior year quarter and nine-month period, respectively.   Our cost of goods sold for interim periods includes a last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) provision that is based on our estimated annual LIFO provision. The annual LIFO provision, which we estimate on a quarterly basis, is affected by expected changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. As a result of the March 2013 announcement of the Walgreens distribution contract, we completed procedures in the quarter ended June 30, 2013 to understand and analyze the amount of branded inventory that we will be required to purchase and warehouse prior to September 1, 2013 to properly service this new customer contract. Due to the additional branded inventory that we will be required to purchase to service the Walgreens contract, estimated to be over $1.0 billion at September 30, 2013, and the impact the branded inventory is estimated to have on our annual inflation index, we recorded a LIFO charge of $122.1 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2013. We currently expect to record a material LIFO charge in our fourth quarter ending September 30, 2013.   Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit decreased 23.5%, or approximately $136.4 million, and decreased 9.2%, or approximately $161.2 million, from the prior year quarter and nine-month period, respectively. Excluding the fiscal 2013 LIFO charge, Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit decreased by $14.4 million and $38.2 million in the quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2013. Excluding the fiscal 2013 LIFO charge, these decreases were primarily due to the lower gross profit related to the Express Scripts contract, the loss of a food and drug retail GPO customer, the lower number of generic launches, and the reduced contribution from the sales of certain specialty oncology drugs. These decreases were offset in part by the growth of our non-oncology specialty distribution businesses. We also recognized gains of $6.0 million and $21.7 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers during the quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2013, respectively. The gains were recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold. There were no gains from antitrust litigation settlements in the prior year quarter or nine-month period.   As a percentage of revenue, Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit margin of 2.06% in the quarter ended June 30, 2013 decreased 99 basis points from the prior year quarter. Excluding the fiscal 2013 LIFO charge, Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit margin of 2.63% in the quarter ended June 30, 2013 decreased 42 basis points from the prior year quarter. As a percentage of revenue, Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit margin of 2.55% in the nine months ended June 30, 2013 decreased 46 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the fiscal 2013 LIFO charge, Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit margin of 2.75% in the nine months ended June 30, 2013 decreased 26 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the fiscal 2013 LIFO charge, the Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit margin declines in the quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2013 were primarily due to lower gross profit margin related to the current Express Scripts contract, the loss of a food and drug retail GPO customer, and competitive pressures on customer margins. These declines were offset in part by the gross profit contributions from the above-mentioned gains from antitrust litigation settlements.   Other gross profit increased by $31.0 million and $180.6 million in the quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2013. The increases in gross profit were primarily due to the incremental contributions made by our fiscal 2012 acquisition of World Courier. As a percentage of revenue, Other gross profit margin of 25.51% in the quarter ended June 30, 2013 increased from 22.15% in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of revenue, Other gross profit margin of 26.29% in the nine months ended June 30, 2013 increased from   20      Table of Contents   18.71% in the prior year period. These increases were primarily due to the gross profit contributions from our fiscal 2012 acquisition of World Courier.

Depreciation expense increased from the prior-year periods due to our fiscal 2012 acquisition of World Courier and due to an increase in capital projects. Amortization expense increased from the prior-year periods due to our fiscal 2012 acquisition of World Courier.   Warrant expense was $35.8 million and $39.6 million in the quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2013, respectively. The Warrants were issued in March 2013 in connection with the agreements and arrangements that define our strategic relationship with Walgreens and Alliance Boots. Refer to the Recent Developments on page 16 for a more detailed description of the Warrants. Future Warrant expense could fluctuate significantly.   Employee severance, litigation and other for the quarter ended June 30, 2013 included $18.1 million of deal-related transaction costs (primarily related to professional fees with respect to the Walgreens and Alliance Boots transaction) and $1.6 million of facility closure and other costs. Employee severance, litigation and other for the nine months ended June 30, 2013 included $22.8 million of deal-related transaction costs (primarily related to professional fees with respect to the Walgreens and Alliance Boots transaction), $4.5 million of facility closure and other costs, offset by a reversal of $5.9 million of severance costs that were initially recorded in connection with fiscal 2012 initiatives. As a result of the announced Walgreens ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement, we terminated a significant portion of our previously planned fiscal 2012 initiatives. Employee severance, litigation and other for the prior year quarter included $4.1 million of deal-related transaction costs. Employee severance, litigation and other for the nine months ended June 30, 2012 included $6.1 million of employee severance costs and $10.6 million of deal-related transaction costs.   As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 1.95% in the quarter ended June 30, 2013, an increase of 17 basis points from the prior year quarter. For the nine months ended June 30, 2013, operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, were 1.82%, up 23 basis points from the prior year nine-month period. These increases were primarily due to the Warrant expense and the addition of our fiscal 2012 World Courier acquisition, which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. For the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, as a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were down 14 basis points from the prior year quarter and down 7 basis points from the prior year nine-month period.   21      Table of Contents   Operating Income              Three months ended               Nine months ended                         June 30,               June 30,                 (dollars in thousands)       2013       2012       Change       2013       2012       Change         Pharmaceutical Distribution       $   165,079       $   307,345       -46.3%       $   774,599       $   947,064       -18.2%         Other       25,060       21,176       18.3%       70,569       54,506       29.5%         Warrants       (35,815   )   —               (39,576   )   —                 Employee severance, litigation and other       (19,678   )   (4,135   )           (21,383   )   (16,721   )             Operating income       $   134,646       $   324,386       -58.5%       $   784,209       $   984,849       -20.4%          Segment operating income is evaluated before Warrant expense and employee severance, litigation and other.   Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income decreased 46.3%, or approximately $142.3 million, and 18.2%, or approximately $172.5 million, from the prior year quarter and nine-month period, respectively. Excluding the fiscal 2013 LIFO charge, Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income decreased 6.6%, or approximately $20.2 million, and 5.2%, or approximately $49.4 million, from the prior year quarter and nine-month period, respectively. Excluding the fiscal 2013 LIFO charge, the 28 basis point decline in Pharmaceutical Distribution operating margin from the prior year quarter and 19 basis point decline from the prior year nine-month period are due to decreased contributions from generic launches, a shift in customer mix towards lower margin business in ABDC (most notably the Express Scripts contract), the loss of a food and drug retail GPO customer, and a decline in the operating margin of our oncology business.   Other operating income increased $3.9 million from the prior year quarter due to the contribution made by our World Courier acquisition, offset in part by the decrease in operating income from our ABCS businesses. Other operating income increased $16.1 million from the prior year nine-month period due to the contribution made by our World Courier acquisition and an increase in operating income from our ABCS businesses.   Interest expense, interest income, and the respective weighted average interest rates in the quarters ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 were as follows (in thousands):              2013       2012                 Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate       Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate         Interest expense       $   18,547       4.74%       $   24,316       4.93%         Interest income       (357   )   0.28%       (545   )   0.22%         Interest expense, net       $   18,190               $   23,771                  Interest expense decreased from the prior year quarter due to a decrease of $392.3 million in average borrowings due to the repayment of our $392 million, 5 5/8% senior notes in September 2012.   22      Table of Contents   Interest expense, interest income, and the respective weighted average interest rates in the nine months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 were as follows (in thousands):              2013       2012                 Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate       Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate         Interest expense       $   55,931       4.72%       $   70,851       4.94%         Interest income       (706   )   0.29%       (1,419   )   0.21%         Interest expense, net       $   55,225               $   69,432                  Interest expense decreased from the prior year nine-month period due to a decrease of $322.1 million in average borrowings, primarily due to the repayment of our $392 million, 5 5/8% senior notes in September 2012, offset in part by the issuance of our $500 million 3 1/2% senior notes in November 2011.   Income taxes in the quarter ended June 30, 2013 reflect an effective income tax rate of 44.7%, compared to 37.7% in the prior year quarter. Income taxes in the nine months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 reflect effective income tax rates of 39.1% and 38.0%, respectively. Our effective tax rate is higher in fiscal 2013 because a portion of the Warrant expense is not tax deductible. Excluding the impact of Warrant expense, our effective tax rates in the quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2013 were 36.2% and 37.7%, respectively. Our future effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly depending upon the quarterly valuation of the Warrants for book accounting purposes. Excluding the impact of Warrant expense, we expect that our effective tax rate in fiscal 2013 will be approximately 38.0%.   Income from continuing operations of $64.1 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2013 decreased 66.3% from the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.27 in the quarter ended June 30, 2013 decreased 63.5% from $0.74 per share in the prior year quarter. Excluding the fiscal 2013 LIFO charge and Warrant expense, income from continuing operations of $171.4 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2013 decreased 9.9% from the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the fiscal 2013 LIFO charge and Warrant expense, of $0.73 in the quarter ended June 30, 2013 decreased 1.4% from the prior year quarter. Income from continuing operations of $442.9 million in the nine months ended June 30, 2013 decreased 22.4% from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.88 in the nine months ended June 30, 2013 decreased 14.2% from $2.19 in the prior year period. Excluding the fiscal 2013 LIFO charge and Warrant expense, income from continuing operations of $553.4 million in the nine months ended June 30, 2013 decreased 3.1% from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the fiscal 2013 LIFO charge and Warrant expense, of $2.35 in the nine months ended June 30, 2013 increased 7.3% from the prior year period. Excluding the fiscal 2013 LIFO charge and Warrant expense, the percentage differences between the changes in diluted earnings per share and the changes in income from continuing operations for the quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2013 were due to the 7.8% and 9.6% reduction, respectively, in weighted average common shares outstanding, primarily from purchases of our common stock, net of the impact of stock option exercises.   Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for all periods presented includes the operating results of AndersonBrecon (“AB”) and AmerisourceBergen Canada Corporation (“ABCC”). The income in the quarter ended June 30, 2013 also includes the gain on the divestiture of AB and an adjustment to the initial estimated loss on the sale of ABCC. The loss in the nine months ended June 30, 2013 also includes a goodwill impairment charge and the initial estimated loss on the sale of ABCC.   23      Table of Contents   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The following table illustrates our debt structure at June 30, 2013, including availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility, the receivables securitization facility and the revolving credit note (in thousands):              Outstanding Balance       Additional Availability         Fixed-Rate Debt:                         $500,000, 5 7/8% senior notes due 2015       $   499,304       $   —         $400,000, 4 7/8% senior notes due 2019       397,726       —         $500,000, 3 1/2% senior notes due 2021       499,409       —         Total fixed-rate debt       1,396,439       —                                   Variable-Rate Debt:                         Multi-currency revolving credit facility due 2018       —       689,623         Receivables securitization facility due 2016       —       950,000         Revolving credit note       —       45,000         Total variable-rate debt       —       1,684,623         Total long-term debt       $   1,396,439       $   1,684,623          Along with our cash balances, our aggregate availability under our multi-currency revolving credit facility, our receivables securitization facility and the revolving credit note provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements.   We have a $700 million multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in November 2017, (the “Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders. In July 2013, we entered into an amendment with the syndicate of lenders primarily to increase the capacity of the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility to $1.4 billion and to extend the maturity date to July 2018. Interest on borrowings under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from 68 basis points to 155 basis points (68 basis points to 130 basis points effective with the July 2013 amendment) over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee, as applicable (90 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee at June 30, 2013). Additionally, interest on borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the Canadian prime rate or the CDOR rate. We pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on our debt rating, ranging from 7 basis points to 20 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (10 basis points at June 30, 2013). We may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales, which we are compliant with as of June 30, 2013.   We have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $700 million at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at June 30, 2013.   In June 2013, we entered into an amendment to our receivables securitization facility (“Receivables Securitization Facility”), to increase the availability under the facility from $700 million to $950 million and extend the expiration date of the facility from November 2015 to June 2016. We have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables   24      Table of Contents   Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are currently based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or LIBOR plus a program fee of 75 basis points. We currently pay an unused fee of 40 basis points, annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. At June 30, 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility.   We have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note (“Revolving Credit Note”) for an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $45 million. The Revolving Credit Note provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $45 million at any time outstanding.   We have $500 million of 5 7/8% senior notes due September 15, 2015 (the “2015 Notes”), $400 million of 4 7/8% senior notes due November 15, 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) and $500 million of 3 1/2% senior notes due November 15, 2021 (the “2021 Notes”). Interest on the 2015 Notes, the 2019 Notes, and the 2021 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears. All of the senior notes rank pari passu to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility.   Our operating results have generated cash flow, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and repurchases of shares of our common stock.   Our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund repurchases of our common stock, fund the payment of dividends, finance acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. In May 2012, our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. During the quarter ended December 31, 2012, we purchased $96.9 million of our common stock to complete our authorization under the $750 million share repurchase program. In November 2012, our board of directors approved a new program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. During the nine months ended June 30, 2013, we purchased $303.9 million of our common stock under the new share repurchase program. As of June 30, 2013, we had $446.1 million of availability remaining on the new $750 million share repurchase program. We have purchased $401.1 million of our common stock in fiscal 2013, which is in line with our expectations for the full fiscal year. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements.   If Walgreens and/or Alliance Boots exercise their rights to purchase our common stock pursuant to the Warrants that we issued to them, the future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the Warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In June 2013, we commenced a hedging strategy to partially mitigate the impact of future increases in the market price of our common stock on our plan to repurchase shares of our common stock to offset the potential dilution associated with the Warrants upon their exercise. Our strategy was implemented by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which it will execute a series of issuer capped call option transactions (“Capped Calls”). We intend to repurchase shares approximating 60% of the potential dilution associated with the Warrants upon their exercise using this hedging strategy. However, the hedge execution will be based upon market conditions, and may be stopped at any time by us. As of June 30, 2013, we purchased Capped Calls on 4.7 million shares of our common stock for a total premium of $43.5 million, of which $27.9 million was paid as of June 30, 2013 and the remainder is accrued as of that date. We believe that we have sufficient capital resources to fund the cost of the hedge strategy.   Deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers. In addition, volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth, our profitability, and our cash flow from operations.   25      Table of Contents   We have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt. We manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. At June 30, 2013, we had no variable-rate debt outstanding. The amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. We periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us. There were no such financial instruments in effect at June 30, 2013.   We also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents. We had $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2013, $559.0 million of which was invested in money market accounts at financial institutions. The unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable-rate debt. For every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable-rate debt, a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million.   We are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-U.S. operations. Our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, and the U.K. Pound Sterling. We may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates. We may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes. As of June 30, 2013, we had one foreign currency denominated contract outstanding that hedges the foreign currency exchange risk of the C$50.0 million note that we received in conjunction with the sale of ABCC.   Following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at June 30, 2013 (in thousands):              Payments Due by Period                 Total       Within 1 Year       1-3 Years       4-5 Years       After 5 Years         Debt, including interest payments       $   1,748,938       $   66,375       $   618,063       $   74,000       $   990,500         Operating leases       263,349       50,991       83,690       57,249       71,419         Other commitments       147,646       88,447       58,879       320       —         Total       $   2,159,933       $   205,813       $   760,632       $   131,569       $   1,061,919          We have commitments to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers through the 2014/2015 flu season. We are required to purchase doses at prices that we believe will represent market prices. We currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately $73.9 million as of June 30, 2013, of which $48.7 million represents our commitment over the next twelve months. These influenza vaccine commitments are included in “Other commitments” in the above table.   We have outsourced to IBM Global Services (“IBM”) a significant portion of our corporate and ABDC information technology activities. The remaining commitment under our 10-year arrangement, as amended, which expires in June 2015, is approximately $61.9 million as of June 30, 2013, of which $31.5 million represents our commitment over the next twelve months, and is included in “Other commitments” in the above contractual obligations table.   Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $50.9 million (including interest and penalties) as of June 30, 2013. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table.   26      Table of Contents   During the nine months ended June 30, 2013, our operating activities provided $819.1 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of $760.1 million in the prior year period. Cash provided by operations during the nine months ended June 30, 2013 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of $442.9 million, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and income taxes of $1.4 billion, and non-cash items of $207.6 million, offset, in part, by an increase in accounts receivable of $835.7 million and an increase in merchandise inventories of $399.1 million. Accounts receivable increased from September 30, 2012, reflecting the increased volume associated with our current Express Scripts contract, and was offset in part by strong customer cash collections. Additionally, while the payment terms in the current Express Scripts contract are favorable, they are longer than the payment terms in the previous Medco contract. As a result, there was a negative impact on our working capital in the current year nine months ended June 30, 2013. We also increased our merchandise inventories at June 30, 2013 to support the increase in volume due to the current Express Scripts contract. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of payments to our suppliers.   We use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. The increase in days sales outstanding from the prior year quarter reflects the payment terms under the current Express Scripts contract.              Quarter ended June 30,       Nine months ended June 30,                 2013       2012       2013       2012         Days sales outstanding       18.6       18.1       18.6       17.7         Days inventory on hand       25.9       25.3       26.2       25.0         Days payable outstanding       44.6       42.8       44.2       42.1          Our cash flow from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based on fluctuations in our period end working capital. We expect cash from operating activities in fiscal 2013 to be between $340 million and $440 million. Operating cash uses during the nine months ended June 30, 2013 included $53.5 million of interest payments and $256.0 million of income tax payments, net of refunds.   During the nine months ended June 30, 2012, our operating activities provided $760.1 million of cash. Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended June 30, 2012 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of $570.9 million, non-cash items of $181.9 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $122.3 million, and a decrease in merchandise inventories of $207.6 million, offset, in part, by a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes of $228.4 million. Accounts receivable declined from September 30, 2011, reflecting timing of customer purchases and payments as of June 30, 2012. The decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the timing of inventory purchases made and the related payments to our suppliers. Operating cash uses during the nine months ended June 30, 2012 included $57.3 million of interest payments and $216.1 million of income tax payments, net of refunds.   Capital expenditures for the nine months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 were $137.9 million and $92.9 million, respectively. Significant capital expenditures in the nine months ended June 30, 2013 included the purchase of one of our leased distribution facilities, technology initiatives including costs related to the further development of our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system, technology-related costs to on-board the incremental Walgreens’ distribution volume, and expansion costs related to one of ABDC’s facilities. We expect to spend approximately $240 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2013. Significant capital expenditures in the nine months ended June 30, 2012 related to our Business Transformation project, which included a new ERP system for our corporate office and for our ABDC operations, ABDC purchases of machinery and equipment and other ABCS facility expansions and improvements.   In May 2013, we divested AB and received $308.1 million of cash and divested ABCC and received $23.5 million of cash. Both divestitures are subject to final purchase price working capital adjustments. On April 30, 2012, we acquired World Courier for a purchase price of $520 million, subject to a working capital adjustment. In November 2011, we acquired TheraCom for a purchase   27      Table of Contents   price of $257.2 million, net of a working capital adjustment. Additionally, we finalized working capital adjustments relating to our September 2011 acquisitions of IntrinsiQ, LLC and Premier Source totaling $0.5 million, net.   In November 2011, we issued our 2021 Notes for net proceeds of $494.8 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2021 Notes for general corporate purposes. In February 2012, we repaid $55.0 million of borrowings under a terminated credit facility.   During the nine months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, we paid $401.1 million and $514.3 million, respectively, for purchases of our common stock shares. During the nine months ended June 30, 2013, we paid $27.9 million to purchase Capped Calls to hedge to potential dilution associated with the Warrants upon their exercise.   In November 2011, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 13% from $0.115 per share to $0.13 per share. In November 2012, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 62% from $0.13 per share to $0.21 per share. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remains within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors.
