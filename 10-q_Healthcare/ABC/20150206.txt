Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on   17      Table of Contents   Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for a more detailed description of this business risk.) ABSG’s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the Medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals, especially oncology drugs administered by physicians. Since ABSG provides a number of services to or through physicians, any changes affecting this service channel could result in revenue reductions.   A number of our contracts with customers or group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) are typically subject to expiration each year. We may lose a significant customer or GPO relationship if any existing contract with such customer or GPO expires without being extended, renewed, or replaced. During the quarter ended December 31, 2014, no significant contracts expired. Over the next twelve months, only one significant contract is scheduled to expire. Our contract with Express Scripts, Inc. (“Express Scripts”) expires in September 2015. However, it is subject to an automatic one year renewal at the election of Express Scripts. Express Scripts accounted for approximately 17% of our revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2014. Our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows will be negatively impacted if the Express Scripts contract is not renewed or the terms of the renewed contract are less favorable than the existing contract.   Other   Revenue in Other increased 15.2% from the prior year quarter primarily due to growth in our distribution business within ABCS, increased revenue from our manufacturer consulting businesses, and an increase in World Courier revenue.   Gross Profit              Three months ended                         December 31,                 (dollars in thousands)       2014       2013       Change         Pharmaceutical Distribution       $   752,056       $   594,206       26.6%         Other       144,267       130,578       10.5%         Gains on antitrust litigation settlements       —       21,023                 LIFO expense       (144,024   )   (57,582   )             Gross profit       $   752,299       $   688,225       9.3%          Gross profit increased 9.3%, or $64.1 million from the prior year quarter.   Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit increased 26.6%, or $157.9 million from the prior year quarter. This increase was due to the revenue growth in brand and generic pharmaceuticals in ABDC, the growth of our specialty distribution businesses, and due to an increase in price appreciation. Gross profit in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 also benefited from income resulting from our participation in the WBA procurement joint venture. There was no income from this joint venture in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of revenue, Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit margin of 2.28% in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 increased 20 basis points from the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily due to brand and generic manufacturer price increases and incremental income from our participation in the WBA procurement joint venture.   Gross profit in Other increased 10.5%, or $13.7 million from the prior year quarter. This increase was due to higher revenue in ABCS and, to a lesser extent, the increase in World Courier’s revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in Other of 20.73% in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 decreased from 21.61% in the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in ABCS distribution revenue, which has a lower gross profit margin in comparison to other businesses within Other.   18      Table of Contents   We recognized gains of $21.0 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers during the quarter ended December 31, 2013. The gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold.   Our cost of goods sold for interim periods includes a last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) provision that is based on our estimated annual LIFO provision. We recorded LIFO expense of $144.0 million and $57.6 million in the quarters ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The annual LIFO provision, which we estimate on a quarterly basis, is affected by expected changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, many of which are difficult to predict. Changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual LIFO provision.   Operating Expenses              Three months ended                         December 31,                 (dollars in thousands)       2014       2013       Change         Distribution, selling and administrative       $   416,491       $   364,060       14.4%         Depreciation and amortization       49,297       43,950       12.2%         Warrants       371,405       116,297       219.4%         Employee severance, litigation and other       3,503       4,302       -18.6%         Total operating expenses       $   840,696       $   528,609       59.0%          Distribution, selling and administrative expenses increased 14.4%, or $52.4 million, from the prior year quarter primarily to support the increase in our revenue, including the WBA volume, which was not fully phased in during the prior year quarter. More specifically, expenses related to payroll and delivery were higher in the current year quarter.   Depreciation expense increased from the prior year quarter due to an increase in the amount of capital projects being depreciated. Amortization expense was comparable to the prior year quarter.   Warrant expense was $371.4 million and $116.3 million in the quarters ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Warrants were issued in March 2013 in connection with the agreements and arrangements that define our strategic relationship with WBA. Warrant expense is largely dependent upon changes in our stock price, therefore, future Warrant expense could fluctuate significantly. (Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Warrants” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for a more detailed description of the accounting for the Warrants.)   Employee severance, litigation and other for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 included $3.0 million of deal-related transaction costs and $0.5 million of employee severance and other costs. Employee severance, litigation and other for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 included $2.2 million of deal-related transaction costs and $2.1 million of employee severance and other costs.   As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 2.50% in the quarter ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 69 basis points from the prior year quarter. This increase was due to the larger Warrant expense in the current year quarter.   19      Table of Contents   Operating Income              Three months ended                         December 31,                 (dollars in thousands)       2014       2013       Change         Pharmaceutical Distribution       $   390,401       $   286,782       36.1%         Other       45,166       35,950       25.6%         Total segment operating income       435,567       322,732       35.0%         Gains on antitrust litigation settlements       —       21,023                 LIFO expense       (144,024   )   (57,582   )             Acquisition related intangibles amortization       (5,032   )   (5,958   )             Warrant expense       (371,405   )   (116,297   )             Employee severance, litigation and other       (3,503   )   (4,302   )             Operating (loss) income       $   (88,397   )   $   159,616       -155.4%          Segment operating income is evaluated before gains on antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO expense; acquisition related intangibles amortization; Warrant expense; and employee severance, litigation and other.   Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income increased 36.1%, or $103.6 million from the prior year quarter due to the increase in gross profit, offset in part by the increase in operating expenses. As a percentage of revenue, Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income margin increased 18 basis points from the prior year quarter primarily due to brand and generic manufacturer price increases and the incremental income from our participation in the WBA procurement joint venture.   Operating income in Other increased 25.6%, or $9.2 million, as an increase in gross profit in ABCS and World Courier was offset, in part, by an increase in ABCS operating expenses.   Total operating loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was primarily driven by the significant Warrant expense resulting from the increase in the market share price of our common stock.   Interest expense, interest income, and the respective weighted average interest rates in the quarters ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (in thousands):              2014       2013                 Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate       Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate         Interest expense       $   17,891       3.05%       $   19,043       4.71%         Interest income       (549   )   0.17%       (211   )   0.47%         Interest expense, net       $   17,342               $   18,832                  20      Table of Contents   Interest expense decreased 6.0%, or $1.2 million, from the prior year quarter due to the repayment of our $500 million, 5.875% senior notes in June 2014, offset, in part, by the May 2014 issuance of our $600 million, 1.15% senior notes and our $500 million, 3.40% senior notes.   Income tax expense was $92.9 million and $92.5 million in the quarters ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively and is determined based on our taxable income. A significant portion of Warrant expense is not tax deductible. As a result, our effective tax rate fluctuates significantly due to quarterly changes in the valuation of the Warrants for financial reporting purposes.   Loss from continuing operations of $199.9 million and diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.91 in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to the increase in Warrant expense and LIFO expense.   Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, includes the impact of a final purchase price adjustment related to the divestiture of AmerisourceBergen Canada Corporation in the three months ended December 31, 2013.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The following table illustrates our debt structure at December 31, 2014, including availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility, the receivables securitization facility and the revolving credit note (in thousands):              Outstanding Balance       Additional Availability         Fixed-Rate Debt:                         $600,000, 1.15% senior notes due 2017       $   599,496       $   —         $400,000, 4.875% senior notes due 2019       398,204       —         $500,000, 3.50% senior notes due 2021       499,515       —         $500,000, 3.40% senior notes due 2024       498,670       —                                   Total fixed-rate debt       1,995,885       —                                   Variable-Rate Debt:                         Multi-currency revolving credit facility due 2019       —       1,400,000         Receivables securitization facility due 2017       —       950,000         Revolving credit note       —       75,000                                   Total variable-rate debt       —       2,425,000         Total debt       $   1,995,885       $   2,425,000          Along with our cash balances, our aggregate availability under our multi-currency revolving credit facility, our receivables securitization facility and the revolving credit note provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements. We have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the December and March quarters that, depending on our cash balance, can require the use of our credit facilities to fund short-term capital needs. Our cash balances in the quarter ended December 31, 2013 needed to be supplemented by intra-period credit facility borrowings to cover short-term working capital needs, which were higher in the quarter ended December 31, 2013 due to the on-boarding of the WBA business.   We have a $1.4 billion multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in August 2019, (the “Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders. Interest on borrowings under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from 69 basis points to 110 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee, as applicable (90 basis points over LIBOR / EURIBOR / Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee at December 31, 2014). Additionally, interest on borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars may accrue at the greater   21      Table of Contents   of the Canadian prime rate or the CDOR rate. We pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on our debt rating, ranging from 6 basis points to 15 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (10 basis points at December 31, 2014). We may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales, which we are compliant with as of December 31, 2014.   We have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $1.4 billion at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at December 31, 2014.   We have a $950 million receivables securitization facility (“Receivables Securitization Facility”), which was scheduled to expire in June 2016. In December 2014, we entered into an amendment to the Receivables Securitization Facility to extend the maturity date to December 2017. We have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or LIBOR plus a program fee of 75 basis points. We pay an unused fee of 40 basis points, annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, which we are compliant with as of December 31, 2014.   We have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note (“Revolving Credit Note”). The Revolving Credit Note provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $75 million. The Revolving Credit Note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice.   We have $600 million of 1.15% senior notes due May 15, 2017 (the “2017 Notes”), $400 million of 4.875% senior notes due November 15, 2019 (the “2019 Notes”), $500 million of 3.50% senior notes due November 15, 2021 (the “2021 Notes”), and $500 million of 3.40% senior notes due May 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”). Interest on the 2017 Notes, the 2019 Notes, the 2021 Notes, and the 2024 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears.   Our operating results have generated cash flow, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, repurchases of shares of our common stock, and our hedging strategy (see below for further details).   Our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund repurchases of our common stock, fund the payment of dividends, finance acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. We intend to finance the acquisition of MWI using a combination of cash, a bank term loan, and the issuance of senior notes. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements.   In August 2013, our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we purchased $174.7 million of our common stock under this share repurchase program. During the quarter ended December 31, 2014, we purchased $132.0 million of our common stock under this share repurchase program, which excluded $18.0 million of fiscal 2014 purchases that cash settled in October 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we had $443.3 million of availability remaining on the $750 million repurchase program. Excluding purchases under the $650 million special share repurchase program, (see below for further details) we currently expect to purchase $200 million of our common stock in fiscal 2015, subject to market conditions.   22      Table of Contents   If WBA exercises its right to purchase our common stock pursuant to the Warrants that we issued to them, the future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the Warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have taken steps to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect that exercise of the Warrants could have by hedging a portion of our future obligation to deliver common stock with a financial institution and repurchasing additional shares of our common stock for our own account over time.   In June 2013, we commenced our hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which it has executed a series of issuer capped call transactions (“Capped Calls”). The Capped Calls give us the right to buy shares of our common stock subject to the Warrants at specified prices at maturity, should the Warrants be exercised in 2016 and 2017 and were initially intended to cover approximately 60% of the shares subject to the Warrants at the time we entered into the transactions. If the Warrants are exercised, we will use a majority of the proceeds to repurchase our shares under the Capped Calls. If our share price exceeds the “cap” price in the Capped Calls at the time the Warrants are exercised, the number of shares that will be delivered to us under the Capped Calls will be reduced, and accordingly, will cover less than 60% of the shares of common stock subject to the Warrants. In addition, if our future share price at the exercise dates is lower than our breakeven share price, then our purchase of the Capped Calls will have been an ineffective use of capital. We completed this hedge transaction in January 2014. In total, under the hedge transaction, we purchased Capped Calls on 27.2 million shares of our common stock for a total premium of $368.7 million.   Based upon our recent share price, the number of shares of common stock we expect to receive under the Capped Calls at maturity has been reduced. Therefore, we amended certain of the Capped Calls to increase their “cap” price to continue to address the potentially dilutive effect of the Warrants. We paid a premium of $100.0 million in January 2015 to increase the cap price on certain of the Capped Calls subject to the warrants that become exercisable in 2016. As of December 31, 2014, we had $78.0 million recorded as a liability related to the total premium. To the extent the Capped Calls and share repurchases do not fully mitigate the dilutive effect of the Warrants, we intend to consider repurchasing additional shares of our common stock and other measures, which may include additional amendments to the Capped Calls. The amount of dilution that we would be able to mitigate will depend on the relative costs and benefits of such a transaction, considering factors such as: our financial performance, the current and future share price of our common stock, our expected cash flows, competing priorities for capital, and overall market conditions.   In May 2014, our board of directors approved a special share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $650 million shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions, as an opportunity to further mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the Warrants and supplements our previously executed warrant hedging strategy. During the quarter ended December 31, 2014, we purchased $132.1 million under this program, which excluded $18.0 million of fiscal 2014 purchases that cash settled in October 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we had $265.9 million of availability remaining on the special $650 million repurchase program.   We have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt. We manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. At December 31, 2014, we had no variable-rate debt outstanding. The amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. We periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us. There were no such financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2014.   We also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents. We had $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014. The unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable-rate debt. For every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable-rate debt, a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million.   We are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-U.S. operations. Our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, the U.K. Pound Sterling, and the Brazilian Real. We may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates. We may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes. As of December 31, 2014, we had   23      Table of Contents   one foreign currency denominated contract outstanding that hedges the foreign currency exchange risk of the C$50.0 million note that we received in conjunction with the sale of ABCC in May 2013.   Changes in the price and volatility of our common stock may have a significant impact on the fair value of the Warrants issued to WBA (see Note 5). As of December 31, 2014, a one dollar change in our common stock, holding other assumptions constant, would increase or decrease the fair value of the Warrants by approximately $43 million and a one percent change in volatility, holding other assumptions constant, would increase or decrease the fair value of the Warrants by approximately $3 million.   Following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at December 31, 2014 (in thousands):              Payments Due by Period                 Total       Within 1 Year       1-3 Years       4-5 Years       After 5 Years         Debt, including interest payments       $   2,398,750       $   60,900       $   718,350       $   508,000       $   1,111,500         Operating leases       333,539       58,209       98,922       74,915       101,493         Other commitments       135,272       97,462       30,271       7,539       —         Total       $   2,867,561       $   216,571       $   847,543       $   590,454       $   1,212,993          We have commitments to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers through the 2015/2016 flu season. We are required to purchase doses at prices that we believe will represent market prices. We currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately $47.1 million as of December 31, 2014, all of which represents our commitment over the next twelve months, and are included in “Other commitments” in the above table.   We have outsourced to IBM Global Services (“IBM”) a significant portion of our corporate and ABDC information technology activities. The remaining commitment under our arrangement, as amended in May 2014, which expires in June 2018, is approximately $64.8 million as of December 31, 2014, of which $31.4 million represents our commitment over the next twelve months, and is included in “Other commitments” in the above table.   Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $53.0 million (including interest and penalties) as of December 31, 2014. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table.   During the quarter ended December 31, 2014, our operating activities provided $897.0 million of cash in comparison to cash used of $1.0 billion in the prior year quarter. Cash provided by operations during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was principally the result of an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and income taxes of $3.5 billion and non-cash items of $420.8 million, offset, in part, by loss from continuing operations of $199.9 million, an increase in merchandise inventories of $2.1 billion and an increase in accounts receivable of $766.7 million. Accounts receivable increased from September 30, 2014, reflecting our increased revenue volume, including additional sales to WBA. Our accounts receivable balance was also favorably impacted by the timing of cash receipts from our customers. We also increased our merchandise inventories at December 31, 2014 to support the increase in volume and, consistent with prior years, due to seasonal needs. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of payments to our suppliers.   We use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. The below financial metrics are calculated based upon a quarterly average and can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, which can vary significantly depending upon the day of the week in which the month ends.   24      Table of Contents              Quarter ended December 31,                 2014       2013         Days sales outstanding       18.8       20.1         Days inventory on hand       30.4       27.0         Days payable outstanding       48.4       42.4          The increase in days payable outstanding from the prior year quarter is the result of increased purchases of generic pharmaceuticals, which have longer payment terms than brand-name pharmaceuticals.   Our cash flow from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based on fluctuations in our period end working capital. Operating cash uses during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 included $31.2 million of interest payments and $3.2 million of income tax payments, net of refunds.   During the quarter ended December 31, 2013, our operating activities used $1.0 billion of cash. Cash used in operations during the quarter ended December 31, 2013 was principally the result of an increase in merchandise inventories of $1.6 billion and an increase in accounts receivable of $159.1 million, offset, in part, by income from continuing operations of $48.9 million, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes of $523.1 million, and non-cash items of $174.6 million. Accounts receivable increased from September 2013, reflecting the increased volume associated with our WBA business. We also increased our merchandise inventories at December 31, 2013 to support the increase in volume due to the WBA business and, consistent with prior years, due to seasonal needs. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of payments to our suppliers.   Capital expenditures for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $52.6 million and $59.2 million, respectively. Significant capital expenditures in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 included technology initiatives, including costs related to the further development of our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system, costs associated with building our new national distribution center, and expansion of support facilities. We currently expect to spend approximately $250 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2015. Significant capital expenditures in the quarter ended December 31, 2013 included infrastructure and technology-related costs to on-board the incremental WBA distribution volume and other technology initiatives, including costs related to the further development of our ERP system.   During the quarters ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we paid $300.2 million and $19.7 million, respectively, for purchases of our common stock. During the quarter ended December 31, 2013, we paid $193.0 million to purchase Capped Calls to hedge the potential dilution associated with the Warrants upon their exercise.   In November 2013, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 12% from $0.21 per share to $0.235 per share. In November 2014, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 23% from $0.235 per share to $0.29 per share. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remains within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors.

(the “Warrants”), an inability to realize anticipated benefits (including benefits resulting from participation in the Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH joint venture), AmerisourceBergen’s inability to implement its hedging strategy to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the issuance of its common stock under its new share repurchase program due to its financial performance, the current and future share price of its common stock, its expected cash flows, competing priorities for capital, and overall market conditions; increasing governmental regulations regarding the pharmaceutical supply channel; federal and state government enforcement initiatives to detect and prevent suspicious orders of controlled substances and the diversion of controlled substances, federal and state prosecution of alleged violations of related laws and regulations, and any related litigation, including shareholder derivative lawsuits or other disputes relation to our distribution of controlled substances; changes in federal and state legislation or regulatory action affecting pharmaceutical product pricing or reimbursement policies, including under Medicaid and Medicare, and the effect of such changes on AmerisourceBergen’s customers; frequent changes to laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse and the increased scrutiny of the federal government related thereto; qui tam legislation for alleged violations of fraud and abuse laws and regulations and/or any other laws and regulations governing the marketing, sale, purchase and/or dispensing of pharmaceutical products or services and any related litigation, including shareholder derivative lawsuits; the acquisition of businesses that do not perform as AmerisourceBergen expects or that are difficult for it to integrate or control or AmerisourceBergen’s inability to successfully complete any other transaction that it may wish to pursue from time to time; risks associated with AmerisourceBergen’s proposed acquisition of MWI, including uncertainties as to the timing of the tender offer and the subsequent merger, the possibility that various conditions to the consummation of the tender offer or the merger may not be satisfied or waived, the effects of disruption from the transactions on the respective businesses of AmerisourceBergen and MWI and the fact that the announcement or pendency of the transactions may make it more difficult to establish or maintain relationships with employees, suppliers and other business partners; risks associated with international business operations, including non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-bribery laws and economic sanctions and import laws and regulations; risks generally associated with the sophisticated information systems on which AmerisourceBergen relies, including significant breakdown or interruption of such systems; risks generally associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data; changes in tax laws or legislative initiatives that could adversely affect AmerisourceBergen’s tax positions and/or AmerisourceBergen’s tax liabilities or adverse resolution of challenges to AmerisourceBergen’s tax positions; natural disasters or other unexpected events that affect AmerisourceBergen’s operations; and other economic, business, competitive, legal, tax, regulatory and/or operational factors affecting AmerisourceBergen’s business generally.
