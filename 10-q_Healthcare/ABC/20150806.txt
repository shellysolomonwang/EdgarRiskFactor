Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for a more detailed description of this business risk.)   A number of our contracts with customers or group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) are typically subject to expiration each year. We may lose a significant customer or GPO relationship if any existing contract with such customer or GPO expires without being extended, renewed, or replaced. During the nine months ended June 30, 2015, no significant contracts expired. Over the next twelve months, the only significant contract scheduled to expire is our contract with Kaiser Permanente (“Kaiser”), which expires in June 2016. Our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows will be negatively impacted if the Kaiser contract is not renewed or the terms of the renewed contract are less favorable than the existing contract.   Other   Revenue in Other increased 147.1% and 78.9% from the prior year quarter and nine month period, respectively, primarily due to the $810.0 million and $1.1 billion revenue contribution from MWI for the quarter and nine month period, respectively, and increases in ABCS revenue.   Gross Profit              Three months ended               Nine months ended                         June 30,               June 30,                 (dollars in thousands)       2015       2014       Change       2015       2014       Change         Pharmaceutical Distribution       $   745,866       $   691,303       7.9%       $   2,347,070       $   1,980,711       18.5%         Other       260,741       131,414       98.4%       597,497       398,362       50.0%         Gains on antitrust litigation settlements       43,567       2,524               65,050       24,396                 LIFO expense       (158,710   )   (133,237   )           (453,878   )   (293,647   )             Gross profit       $   891,464       $   692,004       28.8%       $   2,555,739       $   2,109,822       21.1%          Gross profit increased 28.8%, or $199.5 million, and 21.1%, or $445.9 million, from the prior year quarter and nine month period, respectively. These increases were due to the increase in Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit, the increase in the gross profit of Other, and larger gains on antitrust litigation settlements and were offset in part by the $25.5 million and $160.2 million increase in LIFO expense from the prior year quarter and nine month period, respectively. The increase in LIFO expense was primarily due to higher brand inflation and lower generic drug deflation resulting from the generics pricing environment.   Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit increased 7.9%, or $54.6 million, and 18.5%, or $366.4 million, from the prior year quarter and nine month period, respectively. These increases were due to higher brand and generic sales volume largely attributable to WBA (as noted above). Gross profit also increased due to the growth of our specialty distribution businesses and an increase in income resulting from our participation in the WBA procurement joint venture. Gross profit growth in the current year quarter was adversely impacted by the renewal of our contract with the DOD at less favorable terms and lower generic price appreciation. As a percentage of revenue, Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit margin of 2.28% and 2.41% in the quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2015 decreased 4 basis points and increased 12 basis points from the prior year quarter and nine month period, respectively. The decrease in the quarter ended June 30, 2015 was primarily due to the DOD contract renewal and a decrease in generic price appreciation, and the increase in the nine month period ended June 30, 2015 was primarily due to the increase in ABDC and ABSG sales volume and incremental income from our participation in the WBA procurement joint venture.   20      Table of Contents   Gross profit in Other increased 98.4%, or $129.3 million, and 50.0%, or $199.1 million, from the prior year quarter and nine month period, respectively. These increases were primarily due to the contribution of our MWI acquisition, and, to a lesser extent, the increase in ABCS and World Courier’s revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in Other of 17.01% in the quarter ended June 30, 2015 decreased from 21.19% in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in Other of 18.58% in the nine months ended June 30, 2015 decreased from 22.17% in the prior year nine month period. These decreases were primarily due to the contribution from our MWI acquisition and the increase in ABCS distribution revenue, both of which have a lower gross profit margin in comparison to other businesses within Other.   We recognized gains of $43.6 million and $2.5 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers during the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recognized gains of $65.1 million and $24.4 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers during the nine months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold.   Our cost of goods sold for interim periods includes a last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) provision that is based on our estimated annual LIFO provision. The annual LIFO provision, which we estimate on a quarterly basis, is affected by expected changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, many of which are difficult to predict. Changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual LIFO provision.   Operating Expenses              Three months ended               Nine months ended                         June 30,               June 30,                 (dollars in thousands)       2015       2014       Change       2015       2014       Change         Distribution, selling and administrative       $   502,744       $   387,611       29.7%       $   1,361,678       $   1,128,012       20.7%         Depreciation and amortization       68,430       47,334       44.6%       173,932       135,778       28.1%         Warrants       (14,900   )   145,040               1,109,211       267,000                 Employee severance, litigation and other       2,625       1,142               30,999       7,411                 Total operating expenses       $   558,899       $   581,127               $   2,675,820       $   1,538,201                  Distribution, selling and administrative expenses increased 29.7%, or $115.1 million, from the prior year quarter, and increased 20.7%, or $233.7 million from the prior year nine month period, primarily due to the recent acquisition of MWI. In addition, operating expenses during the current year periods were higher to support the increase in our revenue, including the WBA volume, which was not fully phased in during the prior year periods. More specifically, expenses related to payroll (including incentive compensation), delivery and information technology were higher in the current year periods. As a percentage of revenue, distribution, selling and administrative expenses were 1.47% and 1.36% in the current year quarter and nine month period ended June 30, 2015, respectively, and represents an increase of 19 basis points and 8 basis points, respectively, in comparison to the prior year periods. These increases were primarily due to our acquisition of MWI, which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in comparison to Pharmaceutical Distribution.   Depreciation expense increased from the prior year periods due to an increase in the amount of capital projects being depreciated. Amortization expense increased from prior year periods primarily due to the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets resulting from the MWI acquisition.   Warrant expense decreased significantly from the prior year quarter primarily due to the decline in our stock price during the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Warrant expense increased significantly from the prior year nine month period primarily due to the increase in our stock price since June 30, 2014. The Warrants were issued in March 2013 in connection with the agreements and    21      Table of Contents   arrangements that define our strategic relationship with WBA. Warrant expense is largely dependent upon changes in our stock price, therefore, future Warrant expense could fluctuate significantly. (Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Warrants” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for a more detailed description of the accounting for the Warrants.)   Employee severance, litigation and other for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 included $2.3 million of deal-related transaction costs and $0.4 million of employee severance and other costs. Employee severance, litigation and other for the nine months ended June 30, 2015 included $29.6 million of deal-related transaction costs (primarily related to professional fees with respect to the MWI acquisition) and $1.4 million of employee severance and other costs. Employee severance, litigation and other for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 included $1.5 million of employee severance and other costs, offset in part by the net reversal of $0.4 million of other costs. Employee severance, litigation and other for the nine months ended June 30, 2014 included $5.3 million of deal-related transaction costs and $2.1 million of employee severance and other costs.   Operating Income              Three months ended               Nine months ended                         June 30,               June 30,                 (dollars in thousands)       2015       2014       Change       2015       2014       Change         Pharmaceutical Distribution       $   377,771       $   359,795       5.0%       $   1,256,747       $   1,019,506       23.3%         Other       77,372       33,678       129.7%       186,688       113,261       64.8%         Total segment operating income       455,143       393,473       15.7%       1,443,435       1,132,767       27.4%         Gains on antitrust litigation settlements       43,567       2,524               65,050       24,396                 LIFO expense       (158,710   )   (133,237   )           (453,878   )   (293,647   )             Acquisition related intangibles amortization       (19,710   )   (5,701   )           (34,478   )   (17,484   )             Warrant expense       14,900       (145,040   )           (1,109,211   )   (267,000   )             Employee severance, litigation and other       (2,625   )   (1,142   )           (30,999   )   (7,411   )             Operating income (loss)       $   332,565       $   110,877               $   (120,081   )   $   571,621                  Segment operating income is evaluated before gains on antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO expense; acquisition related intangibles amortization; Warrant expense; and employee severance, litigation and other.   Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income increased 5.0%, or $18.0 million, and 23.3%, or $237.2 million, from the prior year quarter and nine month period, respectively, due to the increase in gross profit, offset in part by the increase in operating expenses from the prior year quarter and nine month period. As a percentage of revenue, Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income margin decreased 6 basis points from the prior year quarter primarily due to the DOD contract renewal and a decrease in generic price appreciation and increased 11 basis points from the prior year nine month period primarily due to the increase in ABDC and ABSG sales volume and incremental income from our participation in the WBA procurement joint venture.   Operating income in Other increased 129.7%, or $43.7 million, and 64.8%, or $73.4 million, from the prior year quarter and nine month period, respectively, primarily as a result of the contribution of our recent MWI acquisition.   Total operating loss for the nine month period ended June 30, 2015 was primarily driven by the significant Warrant expense resulting from the increase in the market share price of our common stock and our LIFO expense.   Interest expense, interest income, and the respective weighted average interest rates in the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in thousands):              2015       2014                 Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate       Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate         Interest expense       $   30,654       2.78%       $   21,125       4.01%         Interest income       (861   )   0.16%       (222   )   0.28%         Interest expense, net       $   29,793               $   20,903                  Interest expense, net, increased 42.5%, or $8.9 million, from the prior year quarter due to an increase of $2.1 billion in average borrowings primarily due to the February 2015 issuance of our $500 million 3.25% senior notes, our $500 million 4.25%   22      Table of Contents   senior notes, and our variable-rate term loan borrowing to finance a portion of the MWI acquisition. Our average borrowing rate was lower during the current year quarter primarily as a result of the recent financings, which bear interest at lower rates.   Interest expense, interest income, and the respective weighted average interest rates in the nine months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in thousands):              2015       2014                 Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate       Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate         Interest expense       $   71,919       2.89%       $   59,746       4.19%         Interest income       (1,838   )   0.17%       (537   )   0.37%         Interest expense, net       $   70,081               $   59,209                  Interest expense, net, increased 18.4%, or $10.9 million, from the prior year nine month period due to an increase of $1.2 billion in average borrowings primarily due to the February 2015 issuance of our $500 million 3.25% senior notes, our $500 million 4.25% senior notes, and our variable-rate term loan borrowing to finance a portion of the MWI acquisition. Our average borrowing rate was lower during the current year nine month period primarily as a result of the recent financings, which bear interest at lower rates.   During the quarter and nine month period ended June 30, 2014, we recorded a $33.0 million loss resulting from the early retirement of our $500 million 5.875% senior notes due in September 2015.   Income tax expense was $90.1 million and $297.8 million in the quarter and nine month period ended June 30, 2015, compared to $71.1 million and $268.9 million in the prior year quarter and nine month period, respectively, and is determined based on our taxable income. A significant portion of Warrant expense is not tax deductible. As a result, our effective tax rate fluctuates significantly due to quarterly changes in the valuation of the Warrants for financial reporting purposes.   Income from continuing operations was $214.2 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Loss from continuing operations was $499.2 million in the nine month period ended June 30, 2015. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.89 in the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $2.27 in the nine month period ended June 30, 2015 was primarily due to Warrant expense and LIFO expense.   Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, includes the impact of a final purchase price adjustment related to the divestiture of AmerisourceBergen Canada Corporation in the nine months ended June 30, 2014.   23      Table of Contents   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The following table illustrates our debt structure at June 30, 2015, including availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility, the receivables securitization facility, the revolving credit note and the overdraft facility (in thousands):              Outstanding Balance       Additional Availability         Fixed-Rate Debt:                         $600,000, 1.15% senior notes due 2017       $   599,604        $   —         $400,000, 4.875% senior notes due 2019       398,371       —         $500,000, 3.50% senior notes due 2021       499,550       —         $500,000, 3.40% senior notes due 2024       498,741       —         $500,000, 3.25% senior notes due 2025       497,437       —         $500,000, 4.25% senior notes due 2045       499,078       —         Total fixed-rate debt       2,992,781       —                                   Variable-Rate Debt:                         Term loan       750,000       —         Multi-currency revolving credit facility due 2019       —       1,400,000         Receivables securitization facility due 2017       —       950,000         Revolving credit note       —       75,000         Overdraft facility (£20,000)       7,370       24,126         Total variable-rate debt       757,370       2,449,126         Total debt       $   3,750,151        $   2,449,126           Along with our cash balances, our aggregate availability under our multi-currency revolving credit facility, our receivables securitization facility, our revolving credit note, and our overdraft facility provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements. We have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the December and March quarters that, depending on our cash balance, can require the use of our credit facilities to fund short-term capital needs. Our cash balances in the nine months ended June, 2014 needed to be supplemented by intra-period credit facility borrowings to cover short-term working capital needs, which were higher in the nine months ended June 30, 2014 due to the on-boarding of the WBA business.   We have a $1.4 billion multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in August 2019, (the “Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders. Interest on borrowings under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from 69 basis points to 110 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee, as applicable (90 basis points over LIBOR / EURIBOR / Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee at June 30, 2015). Additionally, interest on borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the Canadian prime rate or the CDOR rate. We pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on our debt rating, ranging from 6 basis points to 15 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (10 basis points at June 30, 2015). We may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales, which we are compliant with as of June 30, 2015.   We have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $1.4 billion at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at June 30, 2015.   We have a $950 million receivables securitization facility (“Receivables Securitization Facility”), which was scheduled to expire in June 2016. In December 2014, we entered into an amendment to the Receivables Securitization Facility to extend the maturity date to December 2017. We have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December   24      Table of Contents   and March quarters. Interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or LIBOR plus a program fee of 75 basis points. We pay a customary unused fee at prevailing market rates, annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, which we are compliant with as of June 30, 2015.   We have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note (“Revolving Credit Note”). The Revolving Credit Note provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $75 million. The Revolving Credit Note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice. MWI also has an uncommitted U.K. overdraft facility (“Overdraft Facility”), which allows MWI to borrow up to £20 million to fund short term normal trading cycle fluctuations. The Overdraft Facility expires in November 2016.   In February 2015, we entered into a $1.0 billion term loan credit agreement (“Term Loan”), which matures in 2020. The Term Loan is subject to quarterly principal payments equal to (1) 1.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan beginning with the first quarterly principal payment in June 2015 to and including March 2018, and (2) thereafter, 2.50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan, with the remaining balance of the Term Loan due upon maturity. In June 2015, we elected to make an early principal payment of $250 million on the Term Loan, $12.5 million of which was scheduled to be paid in June 2015. The payment was applied in direct order to scheduled principal payments, and as a result, our next required quarterly principal payment is due in June 2019. The Term Loan will bear interest at a rate equal either to a base rate plus a margin or a LIBOR rate plus a margin. The margin will be based on our public debt ratings and ranges from 75 basis points to 125 basis points over a LIBOR rate (100 basis points at June 30, 2015) and 0 to 25 basis points over a base rate. The Term Loan contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, with which we are compliant with as of June 30, 2015.   We have $600 million of 1.15% senior notes due May 15, 2017 (the “2017 Notes”), $400 million of 4.875% senior notes due November 15, 2019 (the “2019 Notes”), $500 million of 3.50% senior notes due November 15, 2021 (the “2021 Notes”), and $500 million of 3.40% senior notes due May 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”). Interest on the 2017 Notes, the 2019 Notes, the 2021 Notes, and the 2024 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears.   In February 2015, we issued $500 million of 3.25% senior notes due March 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) and $500 million of 4.25% senior notes due March 1, 2045 (the “2045 Notes”). The 2025 Notes were sold at 99.47% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 3.31%. The 2045 Notes were sold at 99.81% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 4.26%. The interest on the 2025 and 2045 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears, commencing on September 1, 2015. The 2025 and 2045 Notes rank pari passu to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Note, the 2017 Notes, the 2019 Notes, the 2021 Notes, and the 2024 Notes.   Our operating results have generated cash flow, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, repurchases of shares of our common stock, and our hedging strategy (see below for further details).   Our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund repurchases of our common stock, fund the payment of dividends, finance acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements.   In August 2013, our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million in shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we purchased $174.7 million of our common stock under this share repurchase program. During the nine months ended June 30, 2015, we purchased $260.2 million of our common stock under this share repurchase program, which included $33.6 million of purchases that cash settled in July 2015 and excluded $18.0 million of fiscal 2014 purchases that cash settled in October 2014. As of June 30, 2015, we had $315.1 million of availability remaining on the $750 million repurchase program. Excluding purchases under our special share repurchase programs, (see below for further details) we currently expect to purchase $300 million of our common stock in fiscal 2015, subject to market conditions.   25      Table of Contents   If WBA exercises its right to purchase our common stock pursuant to the Warrants that we issued to them, the future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the Warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have taken steps to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect that exercise of the Warrants could have by hedging a portion of our future obligation to deliver common stock with a financial institution and repurchasing additional shares of our common stock for our own account over time.   In June 2013, we commenced our hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which it has executed a series of issuer capped call transactions (“Capped Calls”). The Capped Calls give us the right to buy shares of our common stock subject to the Warrants at specified prices at maturity, should the Warrants be exercised in 2016 and 2017 and were initially intended to cover approximately 60% of the shares subject to the Warrants at the time we entered into the transactions. If the Warrants are exercised, we will use a majority of the proceeds to repurchase our shares under the Capped Calls. If our share price exceeds the “cap” price in the Capped Calls at the time the Warrants are exercised, the number of shares that will be delivered to us under the Capped Calls will be reduced, and accordingly, will cover less than 60% of the shares of common stock subject to the Warrants. In addition, if our future share price at the exercise dates is lower than our breakeven share price, then our purchase of the Capped Calls will have been an ineffective use of capital. We completed this hedge transaction in January 2014. In total, under the hedge transaction, we purchased Capped Calls on 27.2 million shares of our common stock for a total premium of $368.7 million.   Based upon our recent share price, the number of shares of common stock we expect to receive under the Capped Calls at maturity has been reduced. Therefore, we amended certain of the Capped Calls to increase their “cap” price to continue to address the potentially dilutive effect of the Warrants. We paid a premium of $100.0 million in January 2015 to increase the cap price on certain of the Capped Calls subject to the warrants that become exercisable in 2016.   In May 2014, our board of directors approved a special share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $650 million in shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions, to further mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the Warrants and supplements our previously executed warrant hedging strategy. During the nine months ended June 30, 2015, we purchased $398.0 million under this program, which excluded $18.0 million of fiscal 2014 purchases that cash settled in October 2014, to complete our authorization under this program.   In March 2015, we supplemented our hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which it has executed a series of issuer call options (“Call Options”). The Call Options give us the right to buy shares of our common stock subject to the Warrants at specified prices between April 2015 and October 2015. In total, we purchased Call Options on six million shares of our common stock for a total premium of $80.0 million.   In April 2015, our board of directors approved a new special share repurchase program allowing us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion in shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions, to further mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the Warrants as part of our warrant hedging strategy. During the nine months ended June 30, 2015, we purchased $153.9 million of our common stock under this program, which included $14.3 million of purchases that cash settled in July 2015. As of June 30, 2015, we had $846.1 million of availability remaining on this program. Availability under our new special share repurchase program is reduced by share repurchases, if any, of our common stock on the open market under the special program as well as share repurchases due to the Company’s exercise of Call Options and/or Capped Calls.   Based on the closing price of our Common Stock on June 30, 2015, the Capped Calls associated with the warrants exercisable in 2016 would have covered approximately 49% of the shares subject to the warrants and the Capped Calls associated with the warrants exercisable in 2017 would have covered approximately 45% of the shares subject to the warrants. Adding the shares repurchased through June 30, 2015 under the special share repurchase programs, we would have covered approximately 90% of the warrants exercisable in 2016. Assuming we successfully exercise the remaining three million Call Options between July 2015 and October 2015, we will have covered 100% of the warrants exercisable in 2016 and 49% of the warrants exercisable in 2017. For every five dollar increase in the price of our Common Stock, our coverage on each warrant will decrease by approximately two percent, and for every five dollar decrease in the price of our Common Stock, our coverage on each warrant will increase by approximately two percent.   To the extent the Capped Calls, share repurchases and Call Options do not fully mitigate the dilutive effect of the Warrants, we intend to consider repurchasing additional shares of our common stock and other measures, which may include additional    26      Table of Contents   amendments to the Capped Calls or the purchase of additional Call Options. The amount of dilution that we would be able to mitigate will depend on the relative costs and benefits of such a transaction, considering factors such as: our financial performance, the current and future share price of our common stock, our expected cash flows, competing priorities for capital, and overall market conditions. However, we expect to deploy the capital necessary to cover 100% of the warrants exercisable in 2016.   We have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt. We manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. The amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. In the quarter ended March 31, 2015, we used a $1.0 billion variable rate term loan to finance a portion of the MWI acquisition price. In the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we elected to make an early principal payment of $250 million on the new term loan. We periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us. There were no such financial instruments in effect at June 30, 2015.   We also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents. We had $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2015. The unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable-rate debt. For every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable-rate debt, a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million.   We are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-U.S. operations. Our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, the U.K. Pound Sterling, and the Brazilian Real. We may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates. We may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes. As of June 30, 2015, we had one foreign currency denominated contract outstanding that hedges the foreign currency exchange risk of a C$50.0 million note that we received in conjunction with the sale of a Canadian business in May 2013.   Changes in the price and volatility of our common stock may have a significant impact on the fair value of the Warrants issued to WBA (see Note 6). As of June 30, 2015, a one dollar change in our common stock, holding other assumptions constant, would increase or decrease the fair value of the Warrants by approximately $45 million and a one percent change in volatility, holding other assumptions constant, would have no impact on the fair value of the Warrants.   Following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at June 30, 2015 (in thousands):              Payments Due by Period                 Total       Within 1 Year       1-3 Years       4-5 Years       After 5 Years         Debt, including interest payments       $   4,753,134       $   115,114       $   807,719       $   1,336,051       $   2,494,250         Operating leases       350,891       64,825       109,684       80,719       95,663         Other commitments       192,899       152,974       34,669       5,256       —         Total       $   5,296,924       $   332,913       $   952,072       $   1,422,026       $   2,589,913          We have commitments to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers through the 2015/2016 flu season. We are required to purchase doses at prices that we believe will represent market prices. We currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately $106.1 million as of June 30, 2015, all of which represents our commitment over the next twelve months, and are included in “Other commitments” in the above table.   27      Table of Contents   We have outsourced to IBM Global Services (“IBM”) a significant portion of our corporate and ABDC information technology activities. The remaining commitment under our arrangement, as amended in June 2015, which expires in June 2018, is approximately $65.2 million as of June 30, 2015, of which $39.0 million represents our commitment over the next twelve months, and is included in “Other commitments” in the above table.   Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $55.5 million (including interest and penalties) as of June 30, 2015. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table.   During the nine months ended June 30, 2015, our operating activities provided $2.8 billion of cash in comparison to cash provided of $632.5 million in the prior year period. Cash provided by operations during the nine months ended June 30, 2015 was principally the result of an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and income taxes of $3.5 billion and non-cash items of $1.3 billion, offset, in part, by the loss from continuing operations of $499.2 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $868.7 million, and an increase in merchandise inventories of $700.3 million. The non-cash items were comprised primarily of $1.1 billion of warrant expense. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of payments to our suppliers. Accounts receivable increased from September 30, 2014, reflecting our increased revenue volume, including additional sales to WBA. We also increased our merchandise inventories at June 30, 2015 to support the increase in business volume.   We use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. The below financial metrics are calculated based upon a quarterly average and can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, which can vary significantly depending upon the day of the week in which the month ends.              Quarter ended June 30,       Nine months ended June 30,                 2015       2014       2015       2014         Days sales outstanding       20.5       19.8       19.8       20.1         Days inventory on hand       29.6       28.0       30.0       28.1         Days payable outstanding       54.0       46.1       51.4       44.7          The increase in days payable outstanding from the prior year quarter and nine month period is the result of increased purchases of generic pharmaceuticals, which have longer payment terms than brand-name pharmaceuticals.   Our cash flow from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based on fluctuations in our period end working capital. Operating cash uses during the nine months ended June 30, 2015 included $67.5 million of interest payments and $199.2 million of income tax payments, net of refunds.   During the nine months ended June 30, 2014, our operating activities provided $632.5 million of cash. Cash provided by operations during the nine months ended June 30, 2014 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of $216.2 million, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and income taxes of $1.5 billion, and non-cash items of $456.4 million, offset, in part, by an increase in merchandise inventories of $1.0 billion and an increase in accounts receivable of $535.8 million. Accounts receivable increased from September 2013, reflecting the increased volume associated with our WBA business. We also increased our merchandise inventories at June 30, 2014 to support the increase in volume due to the WBA business. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of payments to our suppliers.   Capital expenditures for the nine months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $157.1 million and $198.7 million, respectively. Significant capital expenditures in the nine months ended June 30, 2015 included technology initiatives, including costs related to the further development of our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system, costs associated with building our new national distribution center, and expansion of support facilities. We currently expect to spend approximately $215 million for capital    28      Table of Contents   expenditures during fiscal 2015. Significant capital expenditures in the nine months ended June 30, 2014, included infrastructure and technology-related costs to on-board the incremental WBA distribution volume, costs associated with building our new national distribution center, and other technology initiatives, including costs related to the further development of our ERP system.   Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 included $1.0 billion of borrowing under our term loan and $996.4 million of proceeds received related to the February 2015 issuance of our 2025 Notes and 2045 Notes. We used the proceeds from these financing activities to fund a portion of our February 24, 2015 acquisition of MWI, a leading animal health distribution company in the United States and in the United Kingdom for a price of $190.00 per share, or $2.6 billion in total.   In June 2014, we invested $117.8 million to acquire a minority ownership interest in a pharmaceutical wholesaler in Brazil and to form a specialty joint venture with the same entity.   During the nine months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, we paid $800.3 million and $570.6 million, respectively, for purchases of our common stock. During the nine months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, we paid $180.0 million and $211.4 million, respectively, to purchase or amend Capped Calls and Call Options, to hedge the potential dilution associated with the Warrants upon their exercise.   In November 2013, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 12% from $0.21 per share to $0.235 per share. In November 2014, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 23% from $0.235 per share to $0.29 per share. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remains within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors.

(the “Warrants”); AmerisourceBergen’s inability to implement its hedging strategy to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the issuance of its common stock in accordance with the Warrants under its special share repurchase program due to its financial performance, the current and future share price of its common stock, its expected cash flows, competing priorities for capital, and overall market conditions; changes in the United States healthcare and regulatory environment; increasing governmental regulations   29      Table of Contents   regarding the pharmaceutical supply channel; federal and state government enforcement initiatives to detect and prevent suspicious orders of controlled substances and the diversion of controlled substances; federal and state prosecution of alleged violations of related laws and regulations, and any related litigation, including shareholder derivative lawsuits or other disputes relating to our distribution of controlled substances; increased federal scrutiny and qui tam litigation for alleged violations of fraud and abuse laws and regulations and/or any other laws and regulations governing the marketing, sale, purchase and/or dispensing of pharmaceutical products or services and any related litigation; material adverse resolution of pending legal proceedings; declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals; the acquisition of businesses that do not perform as expected, or that are difficult to integrate or control, including the integration of recently-acquired MWI or ability to capture all of the anticipated synergies related thereto; managing foreign expansion, including non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-bribery laws and economic sanctions and import laws and regulations; malfunction, failure or breach of the sophisticated information systems to operate as designed; risks generally associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data; changes in tax laws or legislative initiatives that could adversely affect AmerisourceBergen’s tax positions and/or AmerisourceBergen’s tax liabilities or adverse resolution of challenges to AmerisourceBergen’s tax positions; natural disasters or other unexpected events that affect AmerisourceBergen’s operations; and other economic, business, competitive, legal, tax, regulatory and/or operational factors affecting AmerisourceBergen’s business generally. Certain additional factors that management believes could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set forth (i) in Item 1A (Risk Factors) and Item 1 (Business) in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 and elsewhere in that report and (ii) in other reports.   30      Table of Contents   ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   The Company’s most significant market risks are the effects of changing interest rates, foreign currency risk, and changes in the price and volatility of the Company’s common stock. See the discussion under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 2 on page 28.   ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. These controls and procedures also are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.   The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of other members of the Company’s management, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a — 15(e) and 15d — 15(e) under the Exchange Act) and have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for their intended purposes as of the end of the period covered by this report.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, there was no change in AmerisourceBergen Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.   31      Table of Contents   PART II.
