Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for a more detailed description of this business risk.)   A number of our contracts with customers or group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) are typically subject to expiration each year. We may lose a significant customer or GPO relationship if any existing contract with such customer or GPO expires without being extended, renewed, or replaced. During the six months ended March 31, 2015, no significant contracts expired. Our contract with Express Scripts, Inc. (“Express Scripts”) was scheduled to expire in September 2015; however, the current contract was recently extended for one year at the election of Express Scripts. Over the next twelve months, there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire.   Other   Revenue in Other increased 72.2% and 43.0% from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively, primarily due to the $304.3 million revenue contribution from MWI.   Gross Profit              Three months ended               Six months ended                         March 31,               March 31,                 (dollars in thousands)       2015       2014       Change       2015       2014       Change         Pharmaceutical Distribution       $   849,148       $   695,202       22.1%       $   1,601,204       $   1,289,408       24.2%         Other       192,489       136,370       41.2%       336,756       266,948       26.2%         Gains on antitrust litigation settlements       21,483       849               21,483       21,872                 LIFO expense       (151,144   )   (102,828   )           (295,168   )   (160,410   )             Gross profit       $   911,976       $   729,593       25.0%       $   1,664,275       $   1,417,818       17.4%          Gross profit increased 25.0%, or $182.4 million, and 17.4%, or $246.5 million, from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively. These increases were due to the increase in Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit and the increase in the gross profit of Other (see further discussion below) and was offset in part by the $48.3 million and $134.8 million increase in LIFO expense from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively. The increase in LIFO expense was primarily due to lower generic drug deflation resulting from the generics pricing environment, a lower number of more significant generic drugs coming off their exclusivity period, and a slight increase in brand inflation.   Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit increased 22.1%, or $153.9 million, and 24.2%, or $311.8 million, from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively. These increases were due to higher brand and generic sales volume largely attributable to WBA (as noted above). Gross profit also increased due to the growth of our specialty distribution businesses, an increase in price appreciation, and an increase in income resulting from our participation in the WBA procurement joint venture. As a percentage of revenue, Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit margin of 2.67% and 2.47% in the quarter and six months ended March 31, 2015 increased 18 basis points and 19 basis points from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively. These increases were primarily due to brand and generic manufacturer price increases and incremental income from our participation in the WBA procurement joint venture.   20      Table of Contents   Gross profit in Other increased 41.2%, or $56.1 million, and 26.2%, or $69.8 million, from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively. These increases were primarily due to the contribution of our MWI acquisition, and, to a lesser extent, the increase in ABCS and World Courier’s revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in Other of 19.5% in the quarter ended March 31, 2015 decreased from 23.8% in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in Other of 20.0% in the six months ended March 31, 2015 decreased from 22.7% in the prior year six month period. These decreases were primarily due to the contribution from our MWI acquisition and the increase in ABCS distribution revenue, both of which have a lower gross profit margin in comparison to other businesses within Other.   We recognized gains of $21.5 million and $0.8 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers during the quarters ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recognized gains of $21.5 million and $21.9 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers during the six months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold.   Our cost of goods sold for interim periods includes a last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) provision that is based on our estimated annual LIFO provision. The annual LIFO provision, which we estimate on a quarterly basis, is affected by expected changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, many of which are difficult to predict. Changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual LIFO provision.   Operating Expenses              Three months ended               Six months ended                         March 31,               March 31,                 (dollars in thousands)       2015       2014       Change       2015       2014       Change         Distribution, selling and administrative       $   442,443       $   376,341       17.6%       $   858,934       $   740,401       16.0%         Depreciation and amortization       56,205       44,494       26.3%       105,502       88,444       19.3%         Warrants       752,706       5,663               1,124,111       121,960                 Employee severance, litigation and other       24,871       1,967               28,374       6,269                 Total operating expenses       $   1,276,225       $   428,465               $   2,116,921       $   957,074                  Distribution, selling and administrative expenses increased 17.6%, or $66.1 million, from the prior year quarter, and increased 16.0%, or $118.5 million from the prior year six month period, primarily to support the increase in our revenue, including the WBA volume, which was not fully phased in during the prior year periods. More specifically, expenses related to payroll and delivery were higher in the current year quarter and six month period. In addition, operating expenses in the current year quarter were higher due to our recent acquisition of MWI. As a percentage of revenue, distribution, selling and administrative expenses were 1.35% and 1.30% in the current year quarter and six month period ended March 31, 2015, respectively, and represents an increase of 3 basis points and 2 basis points, respectively, in comparison to the prior year periods.   Depreciation expense increased from the prior year periods due to an increase in the amount of capital projects being depreciated. Amortization expense increased from prior year periods primarily due to the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets resulting from the MWI acquisition.   Warrant expense increased significantly from the prior year periods primarily due to the increase in our stock price. The Warrants were issued in March 2013 in connection with the agreements and arrangements that define our strategic relationship with WBA. Warrant expense is largely dependent upon changes in our stock price, therefore, future Warrant expense could fluctuate   21      Table of Contents   significantly. (Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Warrants” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for a more detailed description of the accounting for the Warrants.)   Employee severance, litigation and other for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 included $24.3 million of deal-related transaction costs (primarily related to professional fees with respect to the MWI acquisition) and $0.5 million of employee severance and other costs. Employee severance, litigation and other for the six months ended March 31, 2015 included $27.3 million of deal-related transaction costs and $1.1 million of employee severance and other costs. Employee severance, litigation and other for the quarter ended March 31, 2014 included $3.5 million of deal-related transaction costs offset in part by the net reversal of $1.5 million of employee severance and other costs. Employee severance, litigation and other for the six months ended March 31, 2014 included $5.7 million of deal-related transaction costs and $0.6 million of employee severance and other costs.   Operating Income              Three months ended               Six months ended                         March 31,               March 31,                 (dollars in thousands)       2015       2014       Change       2015       2014       Change         Pharmaceutical Distribution       $   488,574       $   372,929       31.0%       $   878,976       $   659,711       33.2%         Other       64,150       43,633       47.0%       109,316       79,583       37.4%         Total segment operating income       552,724       416,562       32.7%       988,292       739,294       33.7%         Gains on antitrust litigation settlements       21,483       849               21,483       21,872                 LIFO expense       (151,144   )   (102,828   )           (295,168   )   (160,410   )             Acquisition related intangibles amortization       (9,735   )   (5,825   )           (14,768   )   (11,783   )             Warrant expense       (752,706   )   (5,663   )           (1,124,111   )   (121,960   )             Employee severance, litigation and other       (24,871   )   (1,967   )           (28,374   )   (6,269   )             Operating (loss) income       $   (364,249   )   $   301,128       -221.0%       $   (452,646   )   $   460,744       -198.2%          Segment operating income is evaluated before gains on antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO expense; acquisition related intangibles amortization; Warrant expense; and employee severance, litigation and other.   Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income increased 31.0%, or $115.6 million, and 33.2%, or $219.3 million, from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively, due to the increase in gross profit, offset in part by the increase in operating expenses. As a percentage of revenue, Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income margin increased 20 basis points from the prior year quarter and increased 19 basis points from the prior year six month period primarily due to manufacturer price increases and the incremental income from our participation in the WBA procurement joint venture.   Operating income in Other increased 47.0%, or $20.5 million, and 37.4%, or $29.7 million, from the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively, primarily as a result of the contribution of our recent MWI acquisition.   Total operating loss for the quarter and six month period ended March 31, 2015 was primarily driven by the significant Warrant expense resulting from the increase in the market share price of our common stock and our LIFO expense.   22      Table of Contents   Interest expense, interest income, and the respective weighted average interest rates in the quarters ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in thousands):              2015       2014                 Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate       Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate         Interest expense       $   23,374       2.94%       $   19,577       3.85%         Interest income       (428   )   0.18%       (103   )   0.50%         Interest expense, net       $   22,946               $   19,474                  Interest expense, interest income, and the respective weighted average interest rates in the six months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in thousands):              2015       2014                 Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate       Amount       Weighted Average Interest Rate         Interest expense       $   41,265       2.98%       $   38,621       4.23%         Interest income       (977   )   0.18%       (315   )   0.48%         Interest expense, net       $   40,288               $   38,306                  Interest expense, net, increased 17.8%, or $3.5 million, from the prior year quarter and 5.2%, or $2.0 million, from the prior year six month period due to the February 2015 issuance of our $500 million 3.25% senior notes, our $500 million 4.25% senior notes, and our $1.0 billion variable-rate term loan borrowing to finance a portion of the MWI acquisition.   Income tax expense was $114.8 million and $207.7 million in the quarter and six month period ended March 31, 2015, compared to $105.4 million and $197.8 million in the prior year quarter and six month period, respectively and is determined based on our taxable income. A significant portion of Warrant expense is not tax deductible. As a result, our effective tax rate fluctuates significantly due to quarterly changes in the valuation of the Warrants for financial reporting purposes.   Loss from continuing operations was $513.4 million and $713.3 million in the quarter and six month period ended March 31, 2015. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $2.33 and $3.24 in the quarter and six month period ended March 31, 2015 was primarily due to the increase in Warrant expense and LIFO expense.   Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, includes the impact of a final purchase price adjustment related to the divestiture of AmerisourceBergen Canada Corporation in the six months ended March 31, 2014.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The following table illustrates our debt structure at March 31, 2015, including availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility, the receivables securitization facility, the revolving credit note and the overdraft facility (in thousands):   23      Table of Contents              Outstanding Balance       Additional Availability         Fixed-Rate Debt:                         $600,000, 1.15% senior notes due 2017       $   599,550       $   —         $400,000, 4.875% senior notes due 2019       398,287       —         $500,000, 3.50% senior notes due 2021       499,532       —         $500,000, 3.40% senior notes due 2024       498,706       —         $500,000, 3.25% senior notes due 2025       497,369       —         $500,000, 4.25% senior notes due 2045       499,073       —                                   Total fixed-rate debt       2,992,517       —                                   Variable-Rate Debt:                         Term loan        1,000,000       —         Multi-currency revolving credit facility due 2019       —       1,400,000         Receivables securitization facility due 2017       —       950,000         Revolving credit note       —       75,000         Overdraft facility (£20,000)       14,205       15,387                                   Total variable-rate debt       1,014,205       2,440,387         Total debt       $   4,006,722       $   2,440,387          Along with our cash balances, our aggregate availability under our multi-currency revolving credit facility, our receivables securitization facility, our revolving credit note, and our overdraft facility provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements. We have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the December and March quarters that, depending on our cash balance, can require the use of our credit facilities to fund short-term capital needs. Our cash balances in the six months ended March 31, 2014 needed to be supplemented by intra-period credit facility borrowings to cover short-term working capital needs, which were higher in the six months ended March 31, 2014 due to the on-boarding of the WBA business.   We have a $1.4 billion multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in August 2019, (the “Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders. Interest on borrowings under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from 69 basis points to 110 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee, as applicable (90 basis points over LIBOR / EURIBOR / Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee at March 31, 2015). Additionally, interest on borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the Canadian prime rate or the CDOR rate. We pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on our debt rating, ranging from 6 basis points to 15 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (10 basis points at March 31, 2015). We may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales, which we are compliant with as of March 31, 2015.   We have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $1.4 billion at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at March 31, 2015.   We have a $950 million receivables securitization facility (“Receivables Securitization Facility”), which was scheduled to expire in June 2016. In December 2014, we entered into an amendment to the Receivables Securitization Facility to extend the maturity date to December 2017. We have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables    24      Table of Contents   Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or LIBOR plus a program fee of 75 basis points. We pay an unused fee of 40 basis points, annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, which we are compliant with as of March 31, 2015.   We have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note (“Revolving Credit Note”). The Revolving Credit Note provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $75 million. The Revolving Credit Note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice. MWI also has an uncommitted U.K. overdraft facility (“Overdraft Facility”), which allows MWI to borrow up to £20 million to fund short term normal trading cycle fluctuations. The Overdraft Facility expires in November 2016.   In February 2015, we entered into a $1.0 billion term loan credit agreement (“Term Loan”), which matures in 2020. The Term Loan is subject to quarterly principal payments equal to (1) 1.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan beginning with the first quarterly principal payment to and including the third anniversary of the first quarterly principal payment, and (2) thereafter, 2.50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan, with the remaining balance of the Term Loan due upon maturity. The Term Loan will bear interest at a rate equal either to a base rate plus a margin or a LIBOR rate plus a margin. The margin will be based on our public debt ratings and ranges from 75 basis points to 125 basis points over a LIBOR rate (100 basis points at March 31, 2015) and 0 to 25 basis points over a base rate. The Term Loan contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, with which we are compliant with as of March 31, 2015.   We have $600 million of 1.15% senior notes due May 15, 2017 (the “2017 Notes”), $400 million of 4.875% senior notes due November 15, 2019 (the “2019 Notes”), $500 million of 3.50% senior notes due November 15, 2021 (the “2021 Notes”), and $500 million of 3.40% senior notes due May 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”). Interest on the 2017 Notes, the 2019 Notes, the 2021 Notes, and the 2024 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears.   In February 2015, we issued $500 million of 3.25% senior notes due March 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) and $500 million of 4.25% senior notes due March 1, 2045 (the “2045 Notes”). The 2025 Notes were sold at 99.47% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 3.31%. The 2045 Notes were sold at 99.81% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 4.26%. The interest on the 2025 and 2045 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears, commencing on September 1, 2015. The 2025 and 2045 Notes rank pari passu to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Note, the 2017 Notes, the 2019 Notes, the 2021 Notes, and the 2024 Notes.   Our operating results have generated cash flow, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, repurchases of shares of our common stock, and our hedging strategy (see below for further details).   Our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund repurchases of our common stock, fund the payment of dividends, finance acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements.   In August 2013, our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million in shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we purchased $174.7 million of our common stock under this share repurchase program. During the six months ended March 31, 2015, we purchased $148.3 million of our common stock under this share repurchase program, which excluded $18.0 million of fiscal 2014 purchases that cash settled in October 2014. As of March 31, 2015, we had $427.0 million of availability remaining on the $750 million repurchase program. Excluding purchases under the $650 million special share repurchase program, (see below for further details) we currently expect to purchase $200 million of our common stock in fiscal 2015, subject to market conditions.   25      Table of Contents   If WBA exercises its right to purchase our common stock pursuant to the Warrants that we issued to them, the future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the Warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have taken steps to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect that exercise of the Warrants could have by hedging a portion of our future obligation to deliver common stock with a financial institution and repurchasing additional shares of our common stock for our own account over time.   In June 2013, we commenced our hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which it has executed a series of issuer capped call transactions (“Capped Calls”). The Capped Calls give us the right to buy shares of our common stock subject to the Warrants at specified prices at maturity, should the Warrants be exercised in 2016 and 2017 and were initially intended to cover approximately 60% of the shares subject to the Warrants at the time we entered into the transactions. If the Warrants are exercised, we will use a majority of the proceeds to repurchase our shares under the Capped Calls. If our share price exceeds the “cap” price in the Capped Calls at the time the Warrants are exercised, the number of shares that will be delivered to us under the Capped Calls will be reduced, and accordingly, will cover less than 60% of the shares of common stock subject to the Warrants. In addition, if our future share price at the exercise dates is lower than our breakeven share price, then our purchase of the Capped Calls will have been an ineffective use of capital. We completed this hedge transaction in January 2014. In total, under the hedge transaction, we purchased Capped Calls on 27.2 million shares of our common stock for a total premium of $368.7 million.   Based upon our recent share price, the number of shares of common stock we expect to receive under the Capped Calls at maturity has been reduced. Therefore, we amended certain of the Capped Calls to increase their “cap” price to continue to address the potentially dilutive effect of the Warrants. We paid a premium of $100.0 million in January 2015 to increase the cap price on certain of the Capped Calls subject to the warrants that become exercisable in 2016.   In May 2014, our board of directors approved a special share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $650 million in shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions, to further mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the Warrants and supplements our previously executed warrant hedging strategy. During the six months ended March 31, 2015, we purchased $132.1 million under this program, which excluded $18.0 million of fiscal 2014 purchases that cash settled in October 2014. As of March 31, 2015, we had $265.9 million of availability remaining on the special $650 million repurchase program.   In March 2015, we supplemented our hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which it has executed a series of issuer call options (“Call Options”). The Call Options give us the right to buy shares of our common stock subject to the Warrants at specified prices between April and October 2015. In total, we purchased Call Options on six million shares of our common stock for a total premium of $80.0 million, which was accrued as of March 31, 2015.   In April 2015, our board of directors approved a new special share repurchase program allowing us to repurchase up to $1 billion in shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions, to further mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the Warrants as part of our warrant hedging strategy. Availability under our special share repurchase programs (including the remaining availability under our $650 million special share repurchase program) will be reduced by future share repurchases, if any, of our common stock on the open market under the special programs as well as share repurchases due to the Company’s exercise of Call Options and/or Capped Calls.   Based on the closing price of our Common Stock on March 31, 2015, the Capped Calls associated with the warrants exercisable in 2016 would have covered approximately 46% of the shares subject to the warrants and the Capped Calls associated with the warrants exercisable in 2017 would have covered approximately 42% of the shares subject to the warrants. Adding the shares repurchased through March 31, 2015 under the special share repurchase program, we would have covered approximately 70% of the warrants exercisable in 2016. Assuming we successfully exercise the six million Call Options between April and October 2015, we will have covered approximately 95% of the warrants exercisable in 2016. For every five dollar increase in the price of our Common Stock, our coverage on each warrant will decrease by approximately two percent, and for every five dollar decrease in the price of our Common Stock, our coverage on each warrant will increase by approximately two percent.   To the extent the Capped Calls, share repurchases and Call Options do not fully mitigate the dilutive effect of the Warrants, we intend to consider repurchasing additional shares of our common stock and other measures, which may include additional amendments to the Capped Calls or the purchase of additional Call Options. The amount of dilution that we would be able to mitigate    26      Table of Contents   will depend on the relative costs and benefits of such a transaction, considering factors such as: our financial performance, the current and future share price of our common stock, our expected cash flows, competing priorities for capital, and overall market conditions.   We have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt. We manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. The amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. In the quarter ended March 31, 2015, we used a $1.0 billion variable rate term loan to finance a portion of the MWI acquisition price. We periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us. There were no such financial instruments in effect at March 31, 2015.   We also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents. We had $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2015. The unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable-rate debt. For every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable-rate debt, a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million.   We are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-U.S. operations. Our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, the U.K. Pound Sterling, and the Brazilian Real. We may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates. We may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes. As of March 31, 2015, we had one foreign currency denominated contract outstanding that hedges the foreign currency exchange risk of a C$50.0 million note that we received in conjunction with the sale of a Canadian business in May 2013.   Changes in the price and volatility of our common stock may have a significant impact on the fair value of the Warrants issued to WBA (see Note 6). As of March 31, 2015, a one dollar change in our common stock, holding other assumptions constant, would increase or decrease the fair value of the Warrants by approximately $45 million and a one percent change in volatility, holding other assumptions constant, would have no impact on the fair value of the Warrants.   Following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at March 31, 2015 (in thousands):              Payments Due by Period                 Total       Within 1 Year       1-3 Years       4-5 Years       After 5 Years         Debt, including interest payments       $   5,059,878       $   178,902       $   916,788       $   1,452,688       $   2,511,500         Operating leases       356,575       63,743       108,747       81,357       102,728         Other commitments       113,846       77,716       31,451       4,679       —         Total       $   5,530,299       $   320,361       $   1,056,986       $   1,538,724       $   2,614,228          We have commitments to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers through the 2015/2016 flu season. We are required to purchase doses at prices that we believe will represent market prices. We currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately $47.1 million as of March 31, 2015, all of which represents our commitment over the next twelve months, and are included in “Other commitments” in the above table.   We have outsourced to IBM Global Services (“IBM”) a significant portion of our corporate and ABDC information technology activities. The remaining commitment under our arrangement, as amended in May 2014, which expires in June 2018, is    27      Table of Contents   approximately $55.6 million as of March 31, 2015, of which $25.8 million represents our commitment over the next twelve months, and is included in “Other commitments” in the above table.   Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $54.7 million (including interest and penalties) as of March 31, 2015. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table.   During the six months ended March 31, 2015, our operating activities provided $1.6 billion of cash in comparison to cash provided of $112.7 million in the prior year period. Cash provided by operations during the six months ended March 31, 2015 was principally the result of an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and income taxes of $2.6 billion and non-cash items of $1.3 billion, offset, in part, by the loss from continuing operations of $713.3 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $810.9 million, and an increase in merchandise inventories of $611.2 million. The non-cash items were comprised primarily of $1.1 billion of warrant expense. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of payments to our suppliers. Accounts receivable increased from September 30, 2014, reflecting our increased revenue volume, including additional sales to WBA. We also increased our merchandise inventories at March 31, 2015 to support the increase in business volume.   We use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. The below financial metrics are calculated based upon a quarterly average and can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, which can vary significantly depending upon the day of the week in which the month ends.              Quarter ended March 31,       Six months ended March 31,                 2015       2014       2015       2014         Days sales outstanding       20.2       20.5       19.5       20.3         Days inventory on hand       30.1       29.3       30.2       28.1         Days payable outstanding       51.9       45.5       50.1       43.9          The increase in days payable outstanding from the prior year quarter and six month period is the result of increased purchases of generic pharmaceuticals, which have longer payment terms than brand-name pharmaceuticals.   Our cash flow from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based on fluctuations in our period end working capital. Operating cash uses during the six months ended March 31, 2015 included $32.7 million of interest payments and $124.9 million of income tax payments, net of refunds.   During the six months ended March 31, 2014, our operating activities provided $112.7 million of cash. Cash provided by operations during the six months ended March 31, 2014 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of $229.0 million, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and income taxes of $1.6 billion, and non-cash items of $231.6 million, offset, in part, by an increase in merchandise inventories of $1.5 billion and an increase in accounts receivable of $495.5 million. Accounts receivable increased from September 2013, reflecting the increased volume associated with our WBA business. We also increased our merchandise inventories at March 31, 2014 to support the increase in volume due to the WBA business and, consistent with prior years, due to seasonal needs. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of payments to our suppliers.   Capital expenditures for the six months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 were $105.2 million and $125.4 million, respectively. Significant capital expenditures in the six months ended March 31, 2015 included technology initiatives, including costs related to the further development of our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system, costs associated with building our new national distribution center, and expansion of support facilities. We currently expect to spend approximately $250 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2015. Significant capital expenditures in the six months ended March 31, 2014, included infrastructure and    28      Table of Contents   technology-related costs to on-board the incremental WBA distribution volume, costs associated with building our new national distribution center, and other technology initiatives, including costs related to the further development of our ERP system.   Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 included $1.0 billion of borrowing under our term loan and $996.4 million of proceeds received related to the February 2015 issuance of our 2025 Notes and 2045 Notes. We used the proceeds from these financing activities to fund a portion of the MWI purchase price.   During the six months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, we paid $316.5 million and $252.0 million, respectively, for purchases of our common stock. During the six months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, we paid $100.0 million and $211.4 million, respectively, to purchase or amend Capped Calls to hedge the potential dilution associated with the Warrants upon their exercise.   In November 2013, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 12% from $0.21 per share to $0.235 per share. In November 2014, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 23% from $0.235 per share to $0.29 per share. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remains within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors.

(the “Warrants”); AmerisourceBergen’s inability to implement its hedging strategy to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the issuance of its common stock in accordance with the Warrants under its special share repurchase program due to its financial performance, the current and future share price of its common stock, its expected cash flows, competing priorities for capital, and overall market conditions; changes in the United States healthcare and regulatory environment; increasing governmental regulations regarding the pharmaceutical supply channel; federal and state government enforcement initiatives to detect and prevent suspicious orders of controlled substances and the diversion of controlled substances; federal and state prosecution of alleged violations of related laws and regulations, and any related litigation, including shareholder derivative lawsuits or other disputes relating to our distribution of controlled substances; increased federal scrutiny and qui tam litigation for alleged violations of fraud and abuse laws and regulations and/or any other laws and regulations governing the marketing, sale, purchase and/or dispensing of pharmaceutical products or services and any related litigation; material adverse resolution of pending legal proceedings; declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals; the acquisition of businesses that do not perform as expected, or that are difficult to integrate or control, including the integration of recently-acquired MWI or ability to capture all of the anticipated synergies related thereto; managing foreign expansion, including non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-bribery laws and economic sanctions   29      Table of Contents   and import laws and regulations; malfunction, failure or breach of the sophisticated information systems to operate as designed; risks generally associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data; changes in tax laws or legislative initiatives that could adversely affect AmerisourceBergen’s tax positions and/or AmerisourceBergen’s tax liabilities or adverse resolution of challenges to AmerisourceBergen’s tax positions; natural disasters or other unexpected events that affect AmerisourceBergen’s operations; and other economic, business, competitive, legal, tax, regulatory and/or operational factors affecting AmerisourceBergen’s business generally. Certain additional factors that management believes could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set forth (i) in Item 1A (Risk Factors) and Item 1 (Business) in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 and elsewhere in that report and (ii) in other reports.   30      Table of Contents   ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   The Company’s most significant market risks are the effects of changing interest rates, foreign currency risk, and changes in the price and volatility of the Company’s common stock. See the discussion under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 2 on page 27.   ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. These controls and procedures also are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.   The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of other members of the Company’s management, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a — 15(e) and 15d — 15(e) under the Exchange Act) and have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for their intended purposes as of the end of the period covered by this report.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, excluding MWI, there was no change in AmerisourceBergen Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. Management is currently evaluating the impact of MWI on AmerisourceBergen’s internal control over financial reporting.   31      Table of Contents   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1.
