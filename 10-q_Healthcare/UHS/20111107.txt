Item 1A Risk Factors and in Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors and in our Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2011 in Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors. Those factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any of our forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following:        •    our ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations, and/or changes in laws and government regulations;        •    an increasing number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level. No assurances can be given that the implementation of these new laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations;        •    possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government programs, including Medicare or Medicaid;        •    an increase in the number of uninsured and self-pay patients treated at our acute care facilities that unfavorably impacts our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our self-pay patient accounts;        •    our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same, including contracts with United/Sierra Healthcare in Las Vegas, Nevada;        •    the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us, including matters as disclosed in Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings;        •    the potential unfavorable impact on our business of deterioration in national, regional and local economic and business conditions, including a continuation or worsening of unfavorable credit market conditions;        •    competition from other healthcare providers (including physician owned facilities) in certain markets, including McAllen/Edinburg, Texas, the site of one of our largest acute care facilities and Riverside County, California;        •    technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;    28    Table of Contents     •    our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals;        •    demographic changes;        •    our acquisition of PSI: (i) has substantially increased our level of indebtedness which could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could potentially prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements related to our indebtedness, and; (ii) will require us to successfully integrate the operations of PSI with our operations and, even if such integration is accomplished, we may never realize the potential benefits of the acquisition;        •    our ability to successfully integrate and improve our recent acquisitions and the availability of suitable acquisitions and divestiture opportunities;        •    a significant portion of our revenues are produced by facilities located in Texas, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Washington, D.C., Nevada, Virginia, Massachusetts, Mississippi, California and Florida making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs (which have been proposed for the 2012 state fiscal years) as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. Although the fiscal year 2012 state budgets for certain of the states in which we operate have not yet been finalized, we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid reimbursements are likely to be reduced by 3% to 4% (or approximately $45 million to $55 million annually) from the rates in effect during the first half of 2011;        •    our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund the future growth of our business;        •    some of our acute care facilities continue to experience decreasing inpatient admission trends;        •    our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;        •    the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations in July, 2010 implementing the health information technology (“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments starts in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful use criteria”. Our acute care facilities are scheduled to implement an EHR application, on a facility-by-facility basis, beginning in 2011 and ending in 2014, however, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for these incentive payments and, should we qualify, we are unable to quantify the amount of incentive payments we may receive since the amounts is dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each facility. Should we qualify for incentive payments, there may be timing differences in the recognition of the revenues and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the EHR application which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of operations. Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. Although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the HITECH Act;        •    in August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) was enacted into law. Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law would establish a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which would be responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. If the Joint Committee is unable to reach an agreement, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending could be automatically implemented which could result in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2%. We cannot predict if reductions to future Medicare or other government payments to providers will be implemented as a result of the 2011 Act or what impact, if any, the 2011 Act may have on our future results of operations;        •    the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance on current terms;        •    changes in our business strategies or development plans;        •    fluctuations in the value of our common stock, and;        •    other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    29    Table of Contents Given these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. We assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  Revenue recognition: We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided. Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 37% and 38% of our net patient revenues during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 37% and 38% of our net patient revenues during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs, accounted for 42% and 45% of our net patient revenues during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 42% and 46% of our net patient revenues during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Provision for Doubtful Accounts: On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience. Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $262 million at September 30, 2011 and $249 million at December 31, 2010.  Patients who express an inability to pay are reviewed for write-off as potential charity care. Our accounts receivable are recorded net of established charity care reserves of $151 million at September 30, 2011 and $99 million as of December 31, 2010.  Recent Accounting Standards: For a summary of accounting standards, please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as included herein.    30    Table of Contents Results of Operations  Three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010:  The following table summarizes our results of operations and is used in the discussion below for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):                            Three months endedSeptember 30, 2011     Three months endedSeptember 30, 2010        Amount     % ofRevenues     Amount     % ofRevenues     Net revenues   $ 1,848,662       100.0 %    $ 1,323,264       100.0 %    Operating charges:                       Salaries, wages and benefits     845,818       45.8 %      572,742       43.3 %    Other operating expenses     350,358       19.0 %      258,388       19.5 %    Supplies expense     202,817       11.0 %      180,024       13.6 %    Provision for doubtful accounts     155,899       8.4 %      133,467       10.1 %    Depreciation and amortization     75,166       4.1 %      55,530       4.2 %    Lease and rental expense     23,076       1.2 %      18,429       1.4 %                                              Subtotal operating expenses     1,653,134       89.4 %      1,218,580       92.1 %                                              Income from operations     195,528       10.6 %      104,684       7.9 %    Interest expense, net     48,452       2.6 %      11,478       0.9 %                                              Income before income taxes     147,076       8.0 %      93,206       7.0 %    Provision for income taxes     52,234       2.9 %      27,404       2.0 %                                              Net income     94,842       5.1 %      65,802       5.0 %    Less: Income attributable to noncontrolling interests     9,788       0.5 %      10,192       0.8 %                                              Net income attributable to UHS   $ 85,054       4.6 %    $ 55,610       4.2 %                                             Net revenues increased 40% or $525 million to $1.85 billion during the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 as compared to $1.32 billion during the comparable quarter of the prior year. The increase was attributable to:        •    a $54 million or 4% increase in net revenues generated at our acute care hospitals and behavioral health care facilities owned during both periods (which we refer to as “same facility”);        •    $475 million of revenues generated at the facilities acquired by us from Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”) in November, 2010, and;        •    $4 million of other combined net decreases in revenues.  Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $54 million to $147 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 as compared to $93 million during the comparable quarter of the prior year. Included in our income before income taxes during the third quarter of 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, was the following:        •    a decrease of $9 million at our acute care facilities as discussed below in Acute Care Hospital Services;        •    an increase of $106 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in Behavioral Health Services;        •    a decrease of $37 million due to an increase in interest expense resulting primarily from the cost of borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition of PSI in November, 2010;        •    an increase of $4 million resulting from the transaction fees incurred during the third quarter of 2010 in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, and;        •    $10 million of other combined net decreases including the corporate overhead expenses incurred in connection with the behavioral health care facilities acquired from PSI.  Net income attributable to UHS increased $29 million to $85 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 as compared to $56 million during the comparable prior year quarter. The increase during the third quarter of 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, consisted of:        •    an increase of $54 million in income from operations before income taxes, as discussed above, and;    31    Table of Contents     •    a decrease of $25 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting from: (i) the income tax provision recorded on the $54 million increase in pre-tax income, and; (ii) a $4 million favorable discrete tax item recorded during the third quarter of 2010.  Nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010:  The following table summarizes our results of operations and is used in the discussion below for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):                            Nine months endedSeptember 30, 2011     Nine months endedSeptember 30, 2010        Amount     % ofRevenues     Amount     % ofRevenues     Net revenues   $ 5,661,424       100.0 %    $ 4,008,732       100.0 %    Operating charges:                       Salaries, wages and benefits     2,543,760       44.9 %      1,715,220       42.8 %    Other operating expenses     1,054,639       18.6 %      754,530       18.8 %    Supplies expense     615,581       10.9 %      543,766       13.6 %    Provision for doubtful accounts     469,932       8.3 %      402,621       10.0 %    Depreciation and amortization     219,751       3.9 %      163,066       4.1 %    Lease and rental expense     69,583       1.2 %      54,548       1.4 %                                              Subtotal operating expenses     4,973,246       87.8 %      3,633,751       90.6 %                                              Income from operations     688,178       12.2 %      374,981       9.4 %    Interest expense, net     154,677       2.8 %      36,132       0.9 %                                              Income before income taxes     533,501       9.4 %      338,849       8.5 %    Provision for income taxes     192,638       3.4 %      113,870       2.9 %                                              Net income     340,863       6.0 %      224,979       5.6 %    Less: Income attributable to noncontrolling interests     37,967       0.6 %      31,978       0.8 %                                              Net income attributable to UHS   $ 302,896       5.4 %    $ 193,001       4.8 %                                             Net revenues increased 41% or $1.65 billion to $5.66 billion during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 as compared to $4.01 billion during the comparable period of the prior year. The increase was attributable to:        •    a $223 million or 6% increase in net revenues generated at our acute care hospitals and behavioral health care facilities owned during both periods (which we refer to as “same facility”), and;        •    $1.44 billion of revenues generated at the facilities acquired by us from PSI.  Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $195 million to $534 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 as compared to $339 million during the comparable period of the prior year. Included in our income before income taxes during the first nine months of 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year period, was the following:        •    an increase of $27 million at our acute care facilities as discussed below in Acute Care Hospital Services (excluding the favorable impact during the first nine months of 2010 from the reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves, as discussed below);        •    an increase of $316 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in Behavioral Health Services (excluding the favorable impact during the first nine months of 2010 from the reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves, as discussed below);        •    a decrease of $119 million due to an increase in interest expense resulting primarily from the cost of borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition of PSI in November, 2010;        •    a decrease of $16 million resulting from the favorable adjustment recorded during the second quarter of 2010 to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves relating to prior years (please see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as included herein);        •    an increase of $22 million resulting from the transaction fees incurred during the second quarter of 2010 in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, and;        •    $35 million of other combined net decreases including the corporate overhead expenses incurred in connection with the behavioral health care facilities acquired from PSI.    32    Table of Contents Net income attributable to UHS increased $110 million to $303 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 as compared to $193 million during the comparable prior year period. The increase during the first nine months of 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year period, consisted of:        •    an increase of $195 million in income from operations before income taxes, as discussed above;        •    a decrease of $6 million resulting from an increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and;        •    a decrease of $79 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from: (i) a net increase in pre-tax income of $189 million ($195 million increase in income before income taxes net of the $6 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests), and; (ii) a $4 million favorable discrete tax item recorded during the third quarter of 2010.  Acute Care Hospital Services   Same Facility and All Acute Care Basis  We believe that providing our results on a “Same Facility” basis, which includes the operating results for facilities owned in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance. Our “Same Facility” results also neutralize the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods.  As mentioned above, our results for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 were favorably impacted by a $16 million reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves relating to prior years (recorded during the second quarter of 2010). Although approximately $15 million of the favorable impact recorded during the second quarter of 2010 applies to our acute care facilities, the favorable impact is not reflected in the acute care results for the 2010 periods presented as shown on the table below. There were no such adjustments applicable to the 2011 periods presented. After adjusting the below-reflected acute care results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to minority interests) amounted to $262.4 million. There were no other differences between “Same Facility” and “All Acute Care Basis” during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 as there were no acute care hospitals acquired during the period of January 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011.  The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities, on a same facility and all acute care basis, and is used in the discussion below for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):                                            Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2011     %     2010     %     2011     %     2010     %     Net revenues   $ 996,213       100.0     $ 965,807       100.0     $ 3,083,530       100.0     $ 2,929,128       100.0     Salaries, wages and benefits     394,774       39.6       374,799       38.8       1,176,652       38.2       1,116,456       38.1     Other operating expenses     184,935       18.6       178,129       18.4       551,323       17.9       524,689       17.9     Supplies expense     155,881       15.6       159,659       16.5       476,436       15.5       483,821       16.5     Provision for doubtful accounts     138,199       13.9       127,263       13.2       412,213       13.4       379,900       13.0     Depreciation and amortization     50,993       5.1       45,627       4.7       148,257       4.8       133,190       4.5     Lease and rental     13,447       1.3       13,676       1.4       40,547       1.3       40,794       1.4                                                                                       Subtotal operating expenses     938,229       94.2       899,153       93.1       2,805,428       91.0       2,678,850       91.5                                                                                       Income from operations     57,984       5.8       66,654       6.9       278,102       9.0       250,278       8.5     Interest expense, net     957       0.1       908       0.1       2,946       0.1       2,486       0.1                                                                                       Income before income taxes   $ 57,027       5.7     $ 65,746       6.8     $ 275,156       8.9     $ 247,792       8.5                                                                                      Three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010:   During the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $30 million or 3%. Income before income taxes (and before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) decreased $9 million or 13% to $57 million or 5.7% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2011 as compared to $66 million or 6.8% of net revenues during the comparable prior year quarter. The decrease in income from operations at our acute care hospitals during the three month period ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year, was due in part to a moderation of the net revenue increases experienced earlier in the year resulting from improvements in the payor mix.    33    Table of Contents During the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, inpatient admissions to our acute care facilities decreased 2.6% and adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) decreased 0.3%. Patient days at these facilities remained relatively unchanged and adjusted patient days increased 2.2% during the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.4 days and 4.3 days during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 56% during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, net revenue per adjusted admission increased 3.5% and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 0.9%, as compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year.  Nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010:   During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year period, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $154 million or 5%. Income before income taxes (and before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $27 million or 11% to $275 million or 8.9% of net revenues during the first nine months of 2011 as compared to $248 million or 8.5% of net revenues during the comparable prior year period. The increase in income from operations at our acute care hospitals during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the comparable period of the prior year, was due primarily to favorable operating trends experienced primarily during the first six months of 2011 (a favorable change in payor mix and acuity of patients treated at our hospitals, a stabilization of our uninsured patient volumes and a reduction in our supplies expense). As noted above, these favorable operating trends moderated during the third quarter of 2011.  During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year period, inpatient admissions to our acute care facilities decreased 2.0% and adjusted admissions decreased 0.3%. Patient days at these facilities increased 0.2% and adjusted patient days increased 2.0% during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.5 days and 4.4 days during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 59% during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, net revenue per adjusted admission increased 5.5% and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 3.3%, as compared to the comparable period of the prior year.  Charity care and uninsured discounts:   A significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles. We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net. Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, amounting to $246 million and $233 million during three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $708 million and $599 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The estimated costs of providing the charity services was $44 million and $46 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $127 million and $118 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The estimated costs were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned gross charity care and uninsured discount amounts. The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities (excluding provision for doubtful accounts) divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities. An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.

The increase was attributable to the $475 million of net revenues generated at the facilities acquired from PSI in November, 2010 and a $24 million increase in net revenues on a same facility basis, as discussed above. Income before income taxes increased $106 million or 136% to $184 million or 21.7% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2011, as compared to $78 million or 22.2% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2010. The increase was attributable to the income before income taxes generated at the facilities acquired from PSI and an increase in the income before income taxes generated at our behavioral health facilities, on a same facility basis as discussed above.  During the first nine months of 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year period, net revenues at our behavioral health care facilities (including the PSI facilities) increased 142% or $1.50 billion. The increase was attributable to the $1.44 billion of net revenues generated at the facilities acquired from PSI in November, 2010 and a $68 million increase in net revenues on a same facility basis, as discussed above. Income before income taxes increased $318 million or 131% to $560 million or 21.9% of net revenues during the first nine months of 2011, as compared to $242 million or 22.9% of net revenues during the comparable 2010 period. The increase was attributable to the income before income taxes generated at the facilities acquired from PSI and an increase in the income before income taxes generated at our behavioral health facilities, on a same facility basis as discussed above.  Sources of Revenue   Overview: We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.  The following table shows the approximate percentages of net patient revenue for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 presented: (i) on a combined basis for both our acute care and behavioral health facilities; (ii) for our acute care facilities only, and; (iii) for our behavioral health facilities only:                        Acute Care and Behavioral Health Facilities Combined   Percentage of Net PatientRevenues     Percentage of Net PatientRevenues        Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2011     2010     2011     2010     Third Party Payors:                       Medicare     22 %      25 %      22 %      25 %    Medicaid     15 %      13 %      15 %      13 %    Managed Care (HMO and PPOs)     42 %      45 %      42 %      46 %    Other Sources     21 %      17 %      21 %      16 %                                              Total     100 %      100 %      100 %      100 %                                                 Acute Care Facilities   Percentage of Net Patient Revenues     Percentage of Net Patient Revenues        Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2011     2010     2011     2010     Third Party Payors:                       Medicare     24 %      26 %      25 %      27 %    Medicaid     8 %      9 %      8 %      9 %    Managed Care (HMO and PPOs)     45 %      46 %      45 %      46 %    Other Sources     23 %      19 %      22 %      18 %                                              Total     100 %      100 %      100 %      100 %                                               36    Table of Contents                     Behavioral Health Facilities   Percentage of Net PatientRevenues     Percentage of Net PatientRevenues        Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2011     2010     2011     2010     Third Party Payors:                       Medicare     19 %      20 %      17 %      18 %    Medicaid     24 %      25 %      24 %      24 %    Managed Care (HMO and PPOs)     39 %      43 %      38 %      45 %    Other Sources     18 %      12 %      21 %      13 %                                              Total     100 %      100 %      100 %      100 %                                             Medicare: Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities. Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.  Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge. The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient’s Medicare severity diagnosis related group (“MS-DRG”). Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care. This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity. While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an “outlier” payment if a particular patient’s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold.  MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the “hospital market basket index,” gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.  In July, 2009, CMS published the final IPPS 2010 payment rule which provided for a 2.1% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments were considered, our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2010 rule was approximately 1.1%.  In July, 2010, CMS published its final IPPS 2011 payment rule which provided for a 2.6% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall decrease from the proposed federal fiscal year 2011 rule will approximate 1.1%. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.25% in federal fiscal year 2011.  In August, 2011, CMS published its final IPPS 2012 payment rule which provided for a 3.0% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform productivity adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2012 rule will approximate 0.6%. CMS also includes a 2.0% market basket reduction related to prior year documentation and coding adjustments as well as a 1.1% increase related to the correction of a prior year wage index budget neutrality adjustment. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS was also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.10% in federal fiscal year 2012. The projected impact from this IPPS rule noted above reflects all of the adjustments described in this paragraph.    37    Table of Contents In September, 2007, the “TMA, Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of 2007” legislation took effect and scaled back cuts in hospital reimbursement that CMS was set to impose. In federal fiscal years 2010 to 2012, the new law requires CMS to make adjustments to the Medicare standardized amounts in these years to reflect the removal of actual aggregate payment increases or decreases for documentation and coding adjustments that occurred during federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 as compared to the initial CMS estimates. In federal fiscal year 2010, CMS made its initial statutory mandated adjustment under this legislation and will continue to do so in subsequent fiscal years to ensure the implementation of MS-DRGs was budget neutral among all affected hospitals. In July, 2010, the IPPS 2011 final payment rule applied a 2.9% reduction to the 2011 market basket update and indicated another 2.9% reduction would also be applied in 2012 for documenting and coding. In this same rule, CMS indicated a remaining documenting and coding adjustment of 3.9% reduction is still required to be made to future IPPS updates. In the 2012 IPPS final rule, CMS offset 2.0% of this remaining reduction and indicated that the remaining 1.9% may be offset in the IPPS 2013 payment rule.  On January 1, 2005, CMS implemented a new Psychiatric Prospective Payment System (“Psych PPS”) for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program. This system replaced the cost-based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem Psych PPS with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics. The Psych PPS also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. According to the May, 2009 CMS notice, the market basket increase was 2.1% for the period of July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010. According to the April, 2010 CMS notice, the market basket increase was 2.4% for the period of July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011. In January, 2011 CMS published its proposed Psych PPS rule for the fifteen month period July 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012. The market basket increase for this time period is scheduled to be 2.75%, which includes a 0.25% reduction required by the federal Health Care Reform legislation enacted in 2010.  In October 2009, CMS published its annual final Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”) rule for 2010. The final market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.1%. When other statutorily required adjustments are considered the overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2010 is estimated to be 1.9%.  In November 2010, CMS published its annual final Medicare OPPS rule for 2011. The final market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.46%. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.25% in federal fiscal year 2011. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, the overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2011 is estimated to be 3.2%.  In November, 2011, CMS published its annual final Medicare OPPS rule for 2012. The market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 3.0%. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.1% in federal fiscal year 2012 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity adjustment which is 1.1%. In the final rule, CMS is also implementing a significant decrease in the 2012 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center (CMHC) partial hospitalization programs. When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS payment decrease for 2012 is estimated to be 0.7%. Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2012 is estimated to be 2.1%.  In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations implementing the health information technology (“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria.  The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments starts in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary and we are unable to predict which states will ultimately choose to participate. Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful use criteria”. These Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments are intended to offset a portion of the cost incurred to qualify as a meaningful user of EHR. Our acute care facilities have begun implementing an EHR application, on a facility-by-facility basis, beginning in 2011. The implementation is scheduled to be completed in 2013. However, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for these incentive payments and, should we qualify, the amount of incentive payments received is dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each facility. Should we qualify for incentive payments, there may be timing differences in the recognition of the revenues and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the EHR application which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of operations. Approximately $15 million of these incentive payments, which relate to state Medicaid programs, could be received during the fourth quarter of 2011. Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. Although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the HITECH Act.  In August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) was enacted into law. Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law would establish a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which would be responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. If the Joint Committee is unable to reach an agreement, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending could be automatically implemented which could result in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2%. We cannot predict if reductions to future Medicare or other government payments to providers will be implemented as a result of the 2011 Act or what impact, if any, the 2011 Act may have on our future results of operations.  Medicaid: Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.    38    Table of Contents We receive a large concentration of our Medicaid revenues from Texas and significant amounts from Pennsylvania, Illinois, Washington, D.C., Nevada, Virginia, Massachusetts, Mississippi, California and Florida. The majority of these states, as well as most other states in which we operate, have reported significant budget deficits that have resulted in the reduction of Medicaid funding for 2010 and 2011. Furthermore, many states are currently working to effectuate further significant reductions in the level of Medicaid funding due to significant state budget deficits projected for 2012, which could adversely affect future levels of Medicaid reimbursement received by our hospitals. Although the fiscal year 2012 state budgets for certain of the states in which we operate have not yet been finalized, we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid reimbursements are likely to be reduced by 3% to 4% (or approximately $45 million to $55 million annually) from the rates in effect during the first half of 2011.  Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hildalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in CMS-approved private Medicaid supplemental payment (“UPL”) programs. These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties. Our hospitals receive both UPL payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals. The UPL payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer (“IGT”) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals. We received $8 million during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, and $26 million and $28 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of net aggregate UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care payments. If during the fourth quarter of 2011 the hospital district makes IGTs consistent with 2010, we believe we would be entitled to aggregate net UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care payment revenues of approximately $8 million during the quarter.  We incur health-care related taxes (“Provider Taxes”) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items of services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services. Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching dollars as part of their respective state Medicaid programs. We derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments. At current rates of reimbursement, on an annualized basis, we earn an aggregate net benefit of approximately $20 million from Medicaid supplemental payments, after assessed Provider Taxes are considered. This aggregate net benefit is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state’s portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements. However, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated future results of operations.  In July, 2011 in accordance with the state 2012-2013 General Appropriations Act (the “Act”), the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (“THHSC”) published a proposed rule that changes the reimbursement methodology for inpatient services by establishing a statewide base standard dollar amount (“SDA”) rate along with certain hospital specific SDA rate adjustments for geographic location, trauma level designation and teaching hospital status. The new SDA payment methodology became effective September 1, 2011. Similarly, THHSC also incorporated changes in conformance with the Act which results in reductions to various categories of Medicaid hospital outpatient services. The expected reduction to our annual Medicaid inpatient reimbursement resulting from the proposed inpatient SDA payment methodology has been factored into the fiscal year 2012 Medicaid reductions (3% to 4%), as mentioned above.  The THHSC has indicated an intention to expand state Medicaid managed care programs in future state fiscal years starting in the state’s 2012 fiscal year. Although we are unable to determine the impact of the managed care expansion on future Medicaid reimbursement or its impact on Medicaid UPL payments, depending on the actual structure of the actual managed care expansion, this change could have a material adverse impact on our Medicaid UPL payments.  Managed Care: A significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs. In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow. The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate. Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.  Commercial Insurance: Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance. Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital’s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy. Private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.    39    Table of Contents Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or MS-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services. To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers’ reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.  Other Sources: Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage. Such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals’ indigent and charity care policy. Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.  State Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: Hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) adjustment. Congress established a national limit on DSH adjustments.  Upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas and South Carolina’s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received additional reimbursement from each state’s DSH fund. The Texas and South Carolina programs have been renewed for each state’s 2012 fiscal years (covering the period of October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012 for each state). In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of $12 million and $14 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $35 million and $40 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We estimate that our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs will be approximately $12 million during the fourth quarter of 2011. Failure to renew these DSH programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of our hospitals that currently receive DSH payments to qualify for future DSH funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.  Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform: Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, the War on Terrorism, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, the expansion of a Medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.  In March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872, P.L. 111-152) (the “Reconciliation Act”), and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), (the “Affordable Care Act”), were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below.  Immediate Medicare Reductions:  The Reconciliation Act reduced the market basket update for inpatient and outpatient hospitals and inpatient behavioral health facilities by 0.25% in each of 2010 and 2011 and by 0.10% in 2012. Further, the Affordable Care Act implements certain reforms to Medicare Advantage payments, effective in 2011.  Future Medicare Reductions:  Future changes to the Medicare program include:        •    A Medicare shared savings program (effective 2012)        •    A hospital readmissions reduction program (effective 2012)        •    A national pilot program on payment bundling (effective 2013)        •    A value-based purchasing program for hospitals (effective 2012)        •    Reduction to Medicare disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) payments (effective 2014)  Medicaid Revisions:        •    Expanded Medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments (effective 2014)        •    Reduction to Medicaid DSH (effective 2014)  Health Insurance Revisions:        •    Large employer insurance reforms (effective 2014)    40    Table of Contents     •    Individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies (effective 2014)        •    Federally mandated insurance coverage reforms (2010 and forward)  Although we do not believe the above-mentioned Medicare market basket reductions implemented in 2010 will have a material impact on our results of operations, we are unable to estimate the future impact of the other legislative changes as outlined above.  In addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities. The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers’ rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments. Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.  Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.  Other Operating Results  The combined net revenues and income before income taxes generated at our surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers was not material to our results of operations during each of the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.  Interest Expense:  Pursuant to the table below, interest expense was $48 million and $11 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $155 million and $36 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively (amounts in thousands):                            Three MonthsEndedSeptember 30,2011     Three MonthsEndedSeptember 30,2010     Nine MonthsEndedSeptember 30,2011     Nine MonthsEndedSeptember 30,2010     Revolving credit & demand notes   $ 1,214     $ 697     $ 5,251     $ 2,061     $200 million, 6.75% Senior Notes due 2011     3,378       3,377       10,133       10,133     $400 million, 7.125% Senior Notes due 2016     7,124       7,124       21,372       21,372     $250 million, 7.00% Senior Notes due 2018     4,375       97       13,125       97     Term loan facility A     6,041       —        21,521       —      Term loan facility B     14,997       —        50,241       —      Accounts receivable securitization program     674       122       2,015       465                                               Subtotal-revolving credit, demand notes, Senior Notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program     37,803       11,417       123,658       34,128     Interest rate swap expense, net     2,248       1,502       5,851       4,621     Other combined interest expense, including amortization of financing fees     8,623       1,122       25,527       3,589     Capitalized interest on major construction projects     (178 )      (2,516 )      (229 )      (5,889 )    Interest income     (44 )      (47 )      (130 )      (317 )                                              Interest expense, net   $ 48,452     $ 11,478     $ 154,677     $ 36,132                                              Interest expense increased $37 million and $119 million during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods of 2010. The increased interest expense was due primarily to: (i) the increased borrowings used to finance our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010; (ii) an increase in the average effective interest rate, as discussed below, and; (iii) the interest expense incurred during the three and nine month periods of 2011 on the $250 million, 7.00% senior notes issued in September, 2010. The average outstanding borrowings under our $3.30 billion credit agreement (consisting of an $800 million revolving credit facility, a $1.05 billion Term Loan A and a $1.6 billion Term Loan B), accounts receivable securitization program and previously outstanding credit agreement was $2.82 billion and $2.92 billion during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, respectively, as compared to $199 million and $258 million during the three and nine-month periods of 2010, respectively. The effective interest rate on these facilities, including the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense, was 4.5% and 4.8% during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, respectively, and 5.0% and 4.0% during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010, respectively.    41    Table of Contents Discontinued Operations  In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI facilities, one of which is located in Delaware (MeadowWood Behavioral Health System) and two of which are located in Nevada (Montevista Hospital and Red Rock Hospital) as well as one of our legacy facilities in Puerto Rico (Hospital San Juan Capestrano). We completed the divestiture of MeadowWood Behavioral Health System in July, 2011 and the gain/loss on the divestiture did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the FTC, we are required to divest the facility in Puerto Rico within approximately nine months from the date the agreement was finalized, which occurred on April 19, 2011. We have requested that the FTC provide us with approximately eleven months from the date the agreement was finalized to divest the facilities in Nevada. The operating results for the three former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada are discontinued operations during the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2011. Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our consolidated financial statements during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses. The assets and liabilities for Montevista Hospital, Red Rock Hospital and Hospital San Juan Capestrano are reflected as “held for sale” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2011. The assets and liabilities for MeadowWood Behavioral Health System, Montevista Hospital, Red Rock Hospital and Hospital San Juan Capestrano are reflected as “held for sale” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010.  The following table shows the results of operations, on a combined basis, for MeadowWood Behavioral Health System, Montevista Hospital and Red Rock Hospital which are reflected as discontinued operations (amounts in thousands):                    Three Months EndedSeptember 30, 2011     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2011     Net revenues   $ 6,841     $ 27,651     Income from discontinued operations, before income tax expense     1,790       6,340     Income tax expense     (686 )      (2,429 )                          Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense   $ 1,104     $ 3,911                          Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates:  The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):                            Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2011     2010     2011     2010     Provision for income taxes   $ 52,234     $ 27,404     $ 192,638     $ 113,870     Income before income taxes     147,076       93,206       533,501       338,849                                               Effective tax rate     35.5 %      29.4 %      36.1 %      33.6 %                                             The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income before income taxes, minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for each of the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):                            Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2011     2010     2011     2010     Provision for income taxes   $ 52,234     $ 27,404     $ 192,638     $ 113,870     Income before income taxes     147,076       93,206       533,501       338,849     Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests     (9,788 )      (10,192 )      (37,967 )      (31,978 )                                              Income before income taxes, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests     137,288       83,014       495,534       306,871                                               Effective tax rate     38.0 %      33.0 %      38.9 %      37.1 %                                               42    Table of Contents The increase in the effective tax rates during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year periods, was primarily attributable to a $4 million favorable discrete tax item recorded during the third quarter of 2010 and an increase in our blended effective state income tax rate during the 2011 periods due to a greater portion of our earnings being generated in several higher tax rate states.  Outside owners hold various noncontrolling, minority ownership interests in seven of our acute care facilities and one behavioral health care facility. Each of these facilities is owned and operated by a limited liability company (“LLC”) or limited partnership (“LP”). As a result, since there is no income tax liability incurred at the LLC/LP level (since it passes through to the members/partners), the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests does not include any income tax provision/benefit. When computing the provision for income taxes, as reflected on our consolidated statements of income, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from income from continuing operations before income taxes since it represents the third-party members’/partners’ share of the income generated by the joint-venture entities. In addition to providing the effective tax rate, as indicated above (as calculated from dividing the provision for income taxes by the income from continuing operations before income taxes as reflected on the consolidated statements of income), we believe it is helpful to our investors that we also provide our effective tax rate as calculated after giving effect to the portion of our income from continuing operations that is attributable to the third party members/partners.  Liquidity  Net cash provided by operating activities  Net cash provided by operating activities was $563 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 and $413 million during the comparable period of the prior year. The net increase of $150 million was primarily attributable to the following:        •    a favorable change of $176 million due to an increase in net income plus depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation plus/less loss/gain on sale of assets;        •    a $97 million unfavorable change in accounts receivable, as discussed below;        •    a $106 million favorable change in accrued and deferred income taxes, due primarily to an income tax overpayment relating to 2010 and a postponement of third quarter federal estimated income tax payments granted by the Internal Revenue Service to certain taxpayers located in areas that were impacted by flooding during the third quarter of 2011 (the postponement deferred an estimated federal income tax payment of approximately $30 million to $35 million from September, 2011 to October, 2011);        •    a $101 million unfavorable change in other working capital accounts due primarily to timing of accounts payable and accrued compensation payments;        •    a $30 million favorable change in accrued insurance expense, net of commercial premiums paid, partially due to the above-mentioned $16 million reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves recorded during the second quarter of 2010;        •    a $23 million favorable change in other assets and deferred charges, and;        •    $13 million of other combined net favorable changes.  Our days sales outstanding (“DSO”) are calculated by dividing our net revenue by the number of days in the nine-month periods. The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance at September 30th of each year to obtain the DSO. Our DSO were 46 days at September 30, 2011 and 41 days at September 30, 2010. During the first nine months of 2011, our net accounts receivable (net of effects from acquisitions and dispositions) increased approximately $104 million over the balance as of December 31, 2010. The increase was due primarily to: (i) increased revenues experienced by both our acute care and behavioral health care facilities during the nine months of 2011 as a result of increases in adjusted patient days (adjusted for outpatient activity) and revenue per adjusted day; (ii) an increase in Medicaid receivables due from certain states including Illinois and California due to state budgetary pressures; (iii) an increase in receivables due from the Veterans Administration in Texas, and; (iv) an increase in receivables due from a managed care payor in Las Vegas, Nevada which have since been substantially collected subsequent to September 30, 2011. Although a portion of the past due receivables from the states of Illinois and California and Veterans Administration may remain outstanding into 2012, we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us.  Net cash used in investing activities  During the first nine months of 2011, we used $208 million of net cash in investing activities as follows:        •    spent $195 million to finance capital expenditures including capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities;        •    spent $9 million to acquire administrative office buildings located in Pennsylvania and Tennesse;        •    spent $28 million in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application, and;    43    Table of Contents     •    received $24 million of proceeds for the sale of the real property of a closed acute care facility, sale of our ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center and sale of MeadowWood Behavioral Health System located in Delaware.  During the first nine months of 2010, we used $426 million of net cash in investing activities as follows:        •    spent $178 million to finance capital expenditures related to the following: (i) construction costs related to the newly constructed Palmdale Regional Medical Center; (ii) construction costs related to multiple projects in process to add capacity to our busiest behavioral health facilities, and; (iii) capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities;        •    deposited $257 million into a restricted cash account (related to our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010) consisting of the proceeds generated from the issuance during 2010 (together with certain other related amounts) of $250 million of 7% senior notes that mature in October, 2018;        •    spent $13 million in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application, and;        •    received $22 million of combined proceeds in connection with: (i) the divestiture of our minority ownership interest in a healthcare technology company and sale of a portion of our ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center, and; (ii) the sale of the real property of Methodist Hospital located in Louisiana that was severely damaged and closed in 2005 as a result of Hurricane Katrina.  Net cash provided by/used in financing activities  During the first nine months of 2011, we used $345 million of net cash in financing activities as follows:        •    spent $267 million on net repayments of debt due primarily to repayments pursuant to our Term Loan A ($20 million), Term Loan B ($137 million) and revolving credit ($95 million) facilities;        •    generated $36 million of cash from additional borrowings pursuant to our accounts receivable securitization program;        •    spent $24 million on financing costs in connection with an amendment to our credit agreement (which includes our revolving credit agreement, Term Loan A and Term Loan B facilities) which was completed in March, 2011;        •    spent $34 million to pay profit distributions related to noncontrolling interests in majority owned businesses;        •    spent $45 million to repurchase 1.14 million shares of our Class B Common Stock;        •    spent $15 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $.05 per share, and;        •    generated $4 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans.  During the first nine months of 2010, we generated $14 million of net cash provided by financing activities as follows:        •    spent $195 million on net repayments of debt due primarily to repayments pursuant to our $800 million revolving credit facility ($179 million) and accounts receivable securitization program ($10 million);        •    generated $245 million of net proceeds (net of $5 million of financing costs) from the issuance of $250 million of 7% senior notes that mature on October 1, 2018 (these funds were held in escrow until the completion of our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010);        •    spent $24 million to pay profit distributions related to noncontrolling interests in majority owned businesses;        •    spent $4 million to repurchase 110,000 shares of our Class B Common Stock;        •    spent $14 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $.05 per share;        •    generated $5 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans, and;        •    generated $1 million from the sale of noncontrolling ownership interests in majority owned businesses;  2011 Expected Capital Expenditures:  During the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect to spend approximately $80 million to $105 million on capital expenditures. We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and/or additional funds, as discussed below.  Capital Resources  Credit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities  On November 15, 2010, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with various financial institutions. The Credit Agreement is a senior secured facility which provided an initial aggregate commitment amount of $3.45 billion, comprised of a new $800 million revolving credit facility, a $1.05 billion Term Loan A facility and a $1.6 billion Term Loan B facility. Prior to the effectiveness of the Credit Amendment in March, 2011 (as discussed below), we prepaid $125 million of the principal amount of the    44    Table of Contents  Term Loan B and, during the first nine months of 2011, we made scheduled principal payments of $12 million on the Term Loan B and $20 million on the Term Loan A. The revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A mature on November 15, 2015 and the Term Loan B matures on November 16, 2016. The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.  On March 15, 2011, we entered into a first amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”) which provides, among other things, for a reduction in the interest rates payable in connection with borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Upon the effectiveness of the Amendment on March 15, 2011, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election (1) the greatest of (a) the lender’s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month LIBOR plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin of initially 1.25%, 1.25% and 2.00% for the revolving credit facility, the Term Loan A facility and the Term Loan B facility, respectively or (2) one, two, three or six month LIBOR (at our election), plus an applicable margin of initially 2.25%, 2.25% and 3.00% for the revolving credit facility, the Term Loan A facility and the Term Loan B facility, respectively. Effective in August, 2011, the applicable margins for the Term Loan A facility and the revolving credit facility became subject to adjustment based upon our consolidated leverage ratio or corporate credit rating at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for alternate base rate (“ABR”)-based loans and 1.50% to 2.25% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility. The minimum Eurodollar rate for the Term Loan B facility was reduced from 1.50% to 1.00%. The current applicable margins are 0.75% for ABR-based loans and 1.75% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility. Effective in November, 2011, the applicable margin for the Term Loan B facility is subject to adjustment based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.75% to 2.00% for ABR-based loans and 2.75% to 3.00% for LIBOR-based loans. In connection with the Amendment, we paid a fee of 1.00% of the amounts outstanding under the Term Loan B in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.  In October, 2010, we amended our accounts receivable securitization program (“Securitization”) with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks. We increased the size of the Securitization to $240 million (the “Commitments”), from $200 million, and extended the maturity date to October 25, 2013. Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals (“Receivables”) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings. The interest rate on the borrowings is based on the commercial paper rate plus a spread of 0.475% and there is a facility fee of 0.375% required on 102% on the Commitments. We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings. We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us. The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities. The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks. The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans. We had $240 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program at September 30, 2011.  As of September 30, 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under a short-term, on-demand credit facility. Outstanding borrowings, if any, pursuant to this facility are classified as long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet since they can be refinanced through available borrowings under the terms of our Credit Agreement.  As of September 30, 2011, we had an aggregate of $646 million of available borrowing capacity pursuant to the terms of our Credit Agreement and Securitization, net of $64 million of outstanding letters of credit.  On September 29, 2010, we issued $250 million of 7.00% senior unsecured notes (the “Unsecured Notes”) which are scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018. Interest on the Unsecured Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on April 1st and October 1st of each year. The Unsecured Notes can be redeemed in whole at anytime subject to a make-whole call at treasury rate plus 50 basis points prior to October 1, 2014. They are also redeemable in whole or in part at a price of: (i) 103.5% on or after October 1, 2014; (ii) 101.75% on or after October 1, 2015, and; (iii) 100% on or after October 1, 2016. On April 14, 2011, we announced the commencement of an exchange offer for the Unsecured Notes that were originally issued in a private offering. In connection with the original sale of the Unsecured Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement in which we undertook to offer to exchange the outstanding notes for new notes (the “exchange notes”) to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2011, holders of the outstanding notes were able to exchange the outstanding notes for exchange notes in an equal principal amount. The exchange notes were substantially identical to the outstanding notes, except that the exchange notes were registered under the Securities Act and are freely tradable. The exchange offer expired on May 12, 2011.  On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior notes which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016 (the “7.125% Notes”). Interest on the 7.125% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 30th and December 30th of each year. In June, 2008, we issued an additional $150 million of 7.125% Notes which formed a single series with the original 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2006. Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to, and trade interchangeably with, the 7.125% Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006.    45    Table of Contents During 2001, we issued $200 million of senior notes which have a 6.75% coupon rate and which mature on November 15, 2011 (the “6.75% Notes”). The interest on the 6.75% Notes is paid semiannually in arrears on May 15th and November 15th of each year. The 6.75% Notes can be redeemed in whole at any time and in part from time to time. Since we expect to have the borrowing capacity, and intend to refinance the 6.75% Notes upon their maturity in November, 2011 utilizing borrowings under our Credit Agreement, they are classified as long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2011.  In connection with the entering into of the Credit Agreement on November 15, 2010, and in accordance with the Indenture dated January 20, 2000 governing the rights of our existing notes, we entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which our 7.125% Notes (due in 2015) and our 6.75% Notes (due in 2011) will be equally and ratably secured with the lenders under the Credit Agreement with respect to the collateral for so long as the lenders under the Credit Agreement are so secured.  Our Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates and dividends; and requires compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as of September 30, 2011.  The carrying amount and fair value of our debt was $3.69 billion and $3.70 billion at September 30, 2011, respectively. The fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions.  Our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 62% at September 30, 2011 and 66% at December 31, 2010.  We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay dividends and potentially repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) the issuance of equity; (ii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility or through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement, and/or; (iii) the issuance of other long-term debt. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  During the three months ended September 30, 2011, there have been no material changes in the off-balance sheet arrangements consisting of operating leases and standby letters of credit and surety bonds. Reference is made to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  We have various obligations under operating leases or master leases for real property and under operating leases for equipment. The real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income. We sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received from these subleases are offset against the expense. In addition, we lease four hospital facilities from Universal Health Realty Income Trust with terms scheduled to expire in 2014 and 2016. These leases contain up to four, 5-year renewal options. In connection with the leases on three of these hospital facilities, in May, 2011, certain of our subsidiaries provided the required notice to Universal Health Realty Income Trust exercising the 5-year renewal options on McAllen Medical Center, Wellington Regional Medical Center and Southwest Healthcare System, Inland Valley Campus. The lease terms on these facilities were extended to December, 2016.  As of September 30, 2011 we were party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds. Our outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of September 30, 2011 totaled $86 million consisting of: (i) $62 million related to our self-insurance programs; (ii) $7 million related primarily to pending appeals of legal judgments (including judgments related to professional and general liability claims), and; (iii) $17 million of other debt guarantees related to public utilities and entities in which we own a minority interest.      Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  There have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures during the nine months ended September 30, 2011. Reference is made to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.      Item 4. Controls and Procedures  As of September 30, 2011, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure obligations under the 1934 Act and the SEC rules thereunder.    46    Table of Contents Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the third quarter of 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1. Legal Proceedings  We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to litigation, as outlined below.  U.S. v. Marion and UHS:  In November, 2009, the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Virginia Attorney General intervened in a qui tam case that had been filed by former employees of Marion Youth Center under seal in 2007 against Universal Health Services, Inc. (“UHS”), and Keystone Marion, LLC (“Marion”) and Keystone Education and Youth Services, LLC (“Keystone”). The intervention by the DOJ followed the issuance of a series of subpoenas from the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services seeking documents related to the treatment of Medicaid beneficiaries at Marion. The amended complaint filed by the DOJ and Virginia Attorney General alleged causes of action pursuant to the federal and state false claims acts and the Virginia fraud statute. The former employees filed a separate amended complaint alleging employment and retaliation claims as well as false claim act violations. During the third quarter of 2011, we reached a tentative financial settlement of the case subject to a definitive settlement agreement with all parties. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our results of operations for any of the periods presented herein. Should we be unable to finalize a definitive settlement agreement in this matter, we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously against the government’s and the former employees’ allegations. There can be no assurance that we will prevail should this matter be litigated.  Martin v. UHS of Delaware:  UHS of Delaware, Inc., a subsidiary, and one of our non-public schools in California operated by one of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a state False Claim Act case in Sacramento County Superior Court. Plaintiffs are a former student and employees of the Elmira School who claim that the UHS schools in California unlawfully retained public education funding from the state of California for the operation of these schools but failed to meet state requirements pertaining to the operation of non-public schools. We deny liability and intend to defend this case vigorously. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Department of Justice ICD Investigation:  In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (“ICDs”) from 2003 to the present at several of our acute care facilities. The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Claims Determination regarding these devices. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Southwest Healthcare System:  In April, 2010, Southwest Healthcare System (“SWHCS”), which operates Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center in Riverside County, California, received notifications from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and the California Department of Public Health (“CDPH”) that they intended to effectuate the termination of SWHCS’s Medicare provider agreement and hospital license. In May and September of 2010, SWHCS entered into agreements with CMS and CDPH which abated the termination actions. The agreements required SWHCS to engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for SWHCS to meet the Medicare conditions of participation. Pursuant to the agreements, CMS/CDPH would conduct a full certification survey, following the implementation of corrective measures, to determine if SWHCS had achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation.  The certification survey occurred during the last week of July, 2011 and as a result of that survey, CMS requested that an additional, follow-up survey be conducted to address specific items identified in the survey. The follow-up survey was conducted in early November, 2011. On November 4, 2011, SWHCS received notification from CMS that, based upon the results of the November 2, 2011 survey, it has been determined that SWHCS is in compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation for a provider of hospital services and SWHCS has been restored to the deemed status pursuant to its continued accreditation by The Joint Commission.     47    Table of Contents Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital:  On April 11, 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued notice of its decision terminating Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital (“Two Rivers”) in Kansas City, Missouri from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid program. The termination notice was issued as a result of surveys conducted which allegedly found Two Rivers to be out of compliance with the conditions of participation required for participation in the Medicare program and for Two Rivers’ alleged failure to alleviate an “immediate jeopardy” situation. Two Rivers filed an administrative appeal with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Departmental Appeal Board, Civil Remedies Division, seeking review and reversal of that decision. In addition, Two Rivers filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against CMS rescinding the termination action. On April 22, 2011, the District Court issued a temporary restraining order abating the termination action pending a preliminary injunction hearing or an agreement with CMS. On May 17, 2011, Two Rivers and CMS entered into a settlement agreement which resulted in the rescission of the termination notice and actions by CMS. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Two Rivers was required to submit an acceptable plan of correction relative to the immediate jeopardy citation and engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for Two Rivers to meet the applicable Medicare conditions of participation. Both of these actions have occurred. CMS will conduct an initial survey of Two Rivers, expected to occur in early 2012, to determine if the Medicare conditions of participation have been met. During the term of this agreement, Two Rivers remains eligible to receive reimbursements for services rendered to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Two Rivers remains fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their patients and the community it serves. We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with CMS in an effort to resolve these matters. We can provide no assurance that Two Rivers will not ultimately lose its Medicare certification. The operating results of Two Rivers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 or the year ended December 31, 2010.  Matters Relating to PSI:  The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.) for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition of PSI which was completed in November, 2010:  Garden City Employees’ Retirement System v. PSI:  This is a purported shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against PSI and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws. We are uncertain at this time as to potential liability and damages but intend to defend the case vigorously. Should we been deemed liable in this matter, we believe we would be entitled to commercial insurance recoveries for amounts paid by us, subject to certain limitations and deductibles.  Department of Justice Investigation of Sierra Vista:  In 2009, Sierra Vista Hospital in Sacramento, California learned of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) relating to Medicare services provided by the facility. The DOJ ultimately notified the facility that with respect to partial hospitalization and outpatient services, the DOJ believed that the medical record documentation did not adequately support the claims submitted for reimbursement by Medicare. We recently reached a tentative financial settlement with the DOJ. The reserve established in connection with this matter did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. As part of that agreement, the facility will be subject to a corporate integrity agreement, the terms of which have not yet been finalized.  Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:  In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility. The requested documents have been collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination. Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July 2011 requesting additional documents. Those documents are being collected and will be provided to the DOJ. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.  Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital:  In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility. Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010. The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ and we continue to cooperate with the DOJ with respect to this investigation. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.    48    Table of Contents Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services Recoupment Claims:  The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (“DMAS”) has conducted audits at seven former PSI Residential Treatment Centers operated in the Commonwealth of Virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the state’s Medicaid Provider Services Manual (“Manual”). As a result of those audits, DMAS claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities. PSI had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending. The aggregate refund of Medicaid payments made to those facilities, as requested by DMAS, and the corresponding reserve established on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  General:  Currently, and from time to time, some of our other facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies. If one of our facilities is found to have violated these laws and regulations, the facility may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. We do not believe that, other than as described above, any such existing action would materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  Other Matters  The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.  In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.      Item 1A. Risk Factors   Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 includes a listing of risk factors to be considered by investors in our securities. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.      Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
