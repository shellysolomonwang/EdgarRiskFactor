Item 1A Risk Factors and in Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors. Those factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any of our forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following:        • our ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations, and/or changes in laws and government regulations;        • an increasing number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level. No assurances can be given that the implementation of these new laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations;        • possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government programs, including Medicare or Medicaid;        • an increase in the number of uninsured and self-pay patients treated at our acute care facilities that unfavorably impacts our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our self-pay patient accounts;        • our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same, including contracts with United/Sierra Healthcare in Las Vegas, Nevada;    28    Table of Contents     • the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us, including matters as disclosed in Part II Item 1. Legal Proceedings;        • the potential unfavorable impact on our business of deterioration in national, regional and local economic and business conditions, including a continuation or worsening of unfavorable credit market conditions;        • competition from other healthcare providers (including physician owned facilities) in certain markets, including McAllen/Edinburg, Texas, the site of one of our largest acute care facilities and Riverside County, California;        • technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;        • our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals;        • demographic changes;        • our level of indebtedness has increased substantially as a result of our 2010 acquisition of PSI, and will increase more as a result of our planned acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation later in 2012 (as discussed herein), which could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could potentially prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements related to our indebtedness;        • our ability to successfully integrate and improve our recent acquisitions and the availability of suitable acquisitions and divestiture opportunities;        • we receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Illinois, Massachusetts and Virginia, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs (which have been implemented in various forms with respect to our areas of operation in the respective 2013 state fiscal years) as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. In the states in which we operate, based upon the state budgets for the 2012 fiscal year (which generally began at various times during the second half of 2011), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates have been reduced by approximately 3% to 4% (or approximately $45 million to $55 million annually) from the average rates in effect during the states’ 2011 fiscal years (which generally ended during the third quarter of 2011). Our consolidated results of operations for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 include the pro rata portion of these Medicaid rate reductions. Based upon the state budgets for the 2013 fiscal year (which generally begin at various times during the second half of 2012), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates will be reduced by approximately .5% to 1% (or approximately $8 million to $15 million annually) from the average rates in effect during the states’ 2012 fiscal years (which generally end during the third quarter of 2012). We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;        • our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund the future growth of our business;        • some of our acute care facilities continue to experience decreasing inpatient admission trends;        • our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;        • the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations in July, 2010 implementing the health information technology (“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful use criteria”. Certain of our acute care hospitals implemented an EHR application in 2011 and we plan to continue the implementation at each of our acute care hospitals, on a facility-by-facility basis, during 2012 and the first six months of 2013. However, there can be no assurance that we (our acute care hospitals) will ultimately qualify for these incentive payments and, should we qualify, we are unable to quantify the amount of incentive payments we may receive since the amounts are dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each hospital. Should we qualify for incentive payments, there may be timing differences in the recognition of the revenues and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the EHR application which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of operations. Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. Although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the HITECH Act;        • in August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) was enacted into law. The 2011 Act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the “Joint Committee”), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented which, if triggered, would result in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs starting in 2013. We cannot predict whether Congress will attempt to suspend or restructure the automatic budget cuts or what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress;    29    Table of Contents     • as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, our accounts receivable includes approximately $72 million and $54 million, respectively, due from Illinois. Collection of these receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures. Approximately $52 million as of June 30, 2012, and $41 million as of December 31, 2011, of the receivables due from Illinois have been outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date, and a large portion will likely remain outstanding for the foreseeable future. Since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements. However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois. Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from Illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows;        • the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance on current terms;        • changes in our business strategies or development plans;        • fluctuations in the value of our common stock, and;        • other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Given these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. We assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.  Revenue recognition: We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided. Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 39% of our net patient revenues during each of the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 41% of net patient revenues during each of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011. Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs, accounted for 50% and 46% of our net patient revenues during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 49% and 46% of our net patient revenues during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Provision for Doubtful Accounts: On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience. Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $318 million at June 30, 2012 and $253 million at December 31, 2011.  Our accounts receivable includes $72 million as of June 30, 2012 and $54 million as of December 31, 2011 due from Illinois, the collection of which continues to be delayed due to budgetary and funding pressures experienced by the state. Although approximately $52 million of the receivables due from Illinois as of June 30, 2012 have been outstanding in excess of 60 days, and a large portion will likely remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us and therefore no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements. However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois. Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from Illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

The increase was attributable to a $15 million or 1% increase in net revenues generated at our acute care hospitals and behavioral health care facilities owned during both periods (which we refer to as “same facility”);  Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $2 million to $184 million during the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 as compared to $182 million during the comparable quarter of the prior year. Included in our income before income taxes during the second quarter of 2012, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, was the following:        a. a decrease of $18 million at our acute care facilities as discussed below in Acute Care Hospital Services, excluding impact of the implementation of electronic health records (“EHR”) applications at our acute care hospitals, as mentioned in e. below;        b. an increase of $28 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in Behavioral Health Services, excluding the impact of the item mentioned in c. below;        c. an increase of $6 million consisting primarily of the 2011 portion of net Medicaid supplemental revenues recorded during the second quarter of 2012 related to new programs initiated in certain states in which we operate behavioral health care facilities;        d. an increase of $4 million due to a decrease in interest expense resulting primarily from a decrease in our average borrowings outstanding;        e. a decrease of $10 million related to the revenues and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals, and;        f. $8 million of other combined net decreases including increased corporate overhead expenses.  Net income attributable to UHS increased $4 million to $108 million during the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 as compared to $104 million during the comparable prior year quarter. The increase during the second quarter of 2012, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, consisted of:        • an increase of $2 million in income before income taxes, as discussed above;        • an increase of $3 million resulting from a decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and;        • a decrease of $1 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from the income tax provision recorded on the $5 million increase in pre-tax income ($2 million increase in income before income taxes and the $3 million increase in income due to a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests).    31    Table of Contents Six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011:   The following table summarizes our results of operations and is used in the discussion below for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands):                            Six months endedJune 30, 2012     Six months endedJune 30, 2011        Amount     % of NetRevenues     Amount     % of NetRevenues     Net revenues before provision for doubtful accounts   $ 3,860,675          $ 3,744,842          Less: Provision for doubtful accounts     333,283            304,120                                          Net revenues     3,527,392       100.0 %      3,440,722       100.0 %          Operating charges:                       Salaries, wages and benefits     1,730,872       49.1 %      1,667,317       48.5 %    Other operating expenses     700,985       19.9 %      688,811       20.0 %    Supplies expense     403,740       11.4 %      405,282       11.8 %    Depreciation and amortization     144,970       4.1 %      140,809       4.1 %    Lease and rental expense     47,465       1.3 %      45,853       1.3 %                                              Subtotal-operating expenses     3,028,032       85.8 %      2,948,072       85.7 %                                              Income from operations     499,360       14.2 %      492,650       14.3 %    Interest expense, net     92,598       2.6 %      106,225       3.1 %                                              Income before income taxes     406,762       11.5 %      386,425       11.2 %    Provision for income taxes     146,748       4.2 %      140,404       4.1 %                                              Net income     260,014       7.4 %      246,021       7.2 %    Less: Income attributable to noncontrolling interests     23,846       0.7 %      28,179       0.8 %                                              Net income attributable to UHS   $ 236,168       6.7 %    $ 217,842       6.3 %                                             Net revenues increased 3% or $87 million to $3.53 billion during the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 as compared to $3.44 billion during the comparable period of the prior year. The increase was attributable to:        • a $68 million or 2% increase in net revenues generated at our acute care hospitals and behavioral health care facilities, on a same facility basis;        • $36 million of revenues resulting from an agreement, which was part of an industry-wide settlement related to underpayments of Medicare inpatient prospective payments during a number of prior years, entered into during the first quarter of 2012 with the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and;        • $17 million of other combined net decreases in revenues resulting primarily from the divestiture of a behavioral health care facility in January, 2012 (San Juan Capestrano) and temporary closure of a behavioral health care facility that was closed during the third quarter of 2011 from flood damage (the facility re-opened in March, 2012), partially offset by the 2011 portion of Medicaid revenues recorded during the first six months of 2012 related to new supplemental revenue programs initiated in Oklahoma, Ohio and Indiana.  Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $20 million to $407 million during the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 as compared to $386 million during the comparable period of the prior year. Included in our income before income taxes during the first six months of 2012, as compared to the comparable prior year period, was the following:        a. a decrease of $39 million at our acute care facilities as discussed below in Acute Care Hospital Services, excluding the impact of the items mentioned in c., e. and h. below;    32    Table of Contents     b. an increase of $39 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in Behavioral Health Services, excluding the impact of the items mentioned in d. and f. below;        c. an increase of $33 million (net of related expenses) resulting from an agreement, which was part of an industry-wide settlement related to underpayments of Medicare inpatient prospective payments during a number of prior years, entered into with the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;        d. an increase of $7 million representing the 2011 portion of the net Medicaid supplemental reimbursements earned pursuant to the Oklahoma Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program (“SHOPP”) which is expected to provide annual aggregate net reimbursements of $14 million to our facilities located in the state during the state’s fiscal years of 2012 and 2013, retroactive to July 1, 2011;        e. an aggregate decrease of $11 million resulting from: (i) the revised Supplemental Security Income ratios utilized for calculating Medicare disproportionate share hospital reimbursements for federal fiscal years 2006 through 2009 ($7 million unfavorable impact), and; (ii) the write-off of receivables related to revenues recorded during 2011 at two of our acute care hospitals located in Florida resulting from reductions in certain county reimbursements due to reductions in federal matching Inter-Governmental Transfer funds ($4 million unfavorable impact);        f. an increase of $6 million consisting primarily of the 2011 portion of net Medicaid supplemental revenues recorded during the second quarter of 2012 related to new programs initiated in certain states in which we operate behavioral health care facilities;        g. an increase of $14 million due to a decrease in interest expense resulting primarily from a decrease in our average outstanding borrowings and a decrease in our average effective interest rate (due primarily to an amendment to our credit agreement in March of 2011 which, among other things, provided for reductions in the rates payable for borrowings outstanding under our Term Loan A, Term Loan B and revolving credit facility);        h. a decrease of $10 million related to the revenues and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals, and;        i. $19 million of other combined net decreases including increased corporate overhead expenses.  Net income attributable to UHS increased $18 million to $236 million during the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 as compared to $218 million during the comparable prior year period. The increase during the first six months of 2012, as compared to the comparable prior year period, consisted of:        •    an increase of $20 million in income before income taxes, as discussed above;        •    an increase of $4 million resulting from a decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and;        •    a decrease of $6 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from the income tax provision recorded on the $24 million increase in pre-tax income ($20 million increase in income before income taxes and the $4 million increase in income due to a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests).  Acute Care Hospital Services   Same Facility Basis Acute Care Hospitals  We believe that providing our results on a “Same Facility” basis, which includes the operating results for facilities owned in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance. Our “Same Facility” results also neutralize the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods.    33    Table of Contents The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities, on a same facility and all acute care basis, and is used in the discussion below for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands):                                            Three months endedJune 30, 2012     Three months endedJune 30, 2011     Six months endedJune 30, 2012     Six months endedJune 30, 2011        Amount     % of NetRevenues     Amount     % of NetRevenues     Amount     % of NetRevenues     Amount     % of NetRevenues     Net revenues before provision for doubtful accounts   $ 1,008,742          $ 1,000,203          $ 2,036,084          $ 2,019,396          Less: Provision for doubtful accounts     164,144            136,296            289,508            264,101                                                                                            Net revenues     844,598       100.0 %      863,907       100.0 %      1,746,576       100.0 %      1,755,295       100.0 %    Operating charges:                                           Salaries, wages and benefits     383,335       45.4 %      374,400       43.3 %      775,648       44.4 %      751,254       42.8 %    Other operating expenses     170,000       20.1 %      180,145       20.9 %      349,216       20.0 %      353,330       20.1 %    Supplies expense     155,147       18.4 %      155,262       18.0 %      314,455       18.0 %      313,073       17.8 %    Depreciation and amortization     45,325       5.4 %      47,461       5.5 %      92,581       5.3 %      93,488       5.3 %    Lease and rental expense     14,858       1.8 %      13,222       1.5 %      29,210       1.7 %      26,446       1.5 %                                                                                      Subtotal-operating expenses     768,665       91.0 %      770,490       89.2 %      1,561,110       89.4 %      1,537,591       87.6 %                                                                                      Income from operations     75,933       9.0 %      93,417       10.8 %      185,466       10.6 %      217,704       12.4 %    Interest expense, net     1,204       0.1 %      983       0.1 %      2,382       0.1 %      1,989       0.1 %                                                                                      Income before income taxes     74,729       8.8 %      92,434       10.7 %      183,084       10.5 %      215,715       12.3 %                                                                                     Three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011:  During the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, net revenues at our acute care hospitals, on a same facility basis, decreased $19 million or 2%. Income before income taxes (and before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) decreased $18 million or 19% to $75 million or 8.8% of net revenues during the second quarter of 2012 as compared to $92 million or 10.7% of net revenues during the comparable prior year quarter.  During the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, inpatient admissions to our acute care facilities decreased 4.3% and adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) decreased 1.3%. Patient days at these facilities decreased 2.4% during the second quarter of 2012 and adjusted patient days increased 0.7% during the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.5 days and 4.4 days during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 53% and 55% during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, net revenue per adjusted admission decreased 0.9% and net revenue per adjusted patient day decreased 2.9%, as compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year.  Six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011:  During the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, as compared to the comparable prior year period, net revenues at our acute care hospitals, on a same facility basis, decreased $9 million or 1%. Income before income taxes (and before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) decreased $33 million or 15% to $183 million or 10.5% of net revenues during the first six months of 2012 as compared to $216 million or 12.3% of net revenues during the comparable prior year period.  During the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, as compared to the comparable prior year period, inpatient admissions to our acute care facilities decreased 3.0% and adjusted admissions increased 0.4%. Patient days at these facilities decreased 2.5% during the first six months of 2012 and adjusted patient days increased 0.9% during the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.5 days during each of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 55% and 57% during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, net revenue per adjusted admission decreased 0.9% and net revenue per adjusted patient day decreased 1.4%, as compared to the comparable period of the prior year.  The decreases in income from operations, net revenues and net revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day experienced at our acute care hospitals during the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, as compared to the comparable periods of the prior year, were largely due to difficult comparisons to the prior year periods when our acute care net revenues were favorably impacted by positive changes in payor mix of patients treated at our hospitals and a stabilization of uninsured patient volumes.  Charity care and uninsured discounts:   A significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles. We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net    34    Table of Contents  revenues or in accounts receivable, net. Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, amounting to $266 million and $239 million during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $581 million and $462 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The estimated costs of providing the charity services was $44 million and $43 million during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $97 million and $82 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The estimated costs were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned gross charity care and uninsured discount amounts. The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities. An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.  All Acute Care Hospitals  The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care hospitals for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011.  Three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011:  Included in the financial results below for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, in addition to our acute care hospitals’ same facility basis financial results as discussed above, were certain other items consisting primarily of a net charge of $10 million recorded during the second quarter of 2012 related to the revenues ($2 million) and expenses ($12 million) recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health records (“EHR”) applications at our acute care hospitals (see HITECH Act in Sources of Revenue below for additional disclosure).  Six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011:  Included in the financial results below for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, in addition to our acute care hospitals’ same facility basis financial results as discussed above, were the following items:      •    a net favorable impact of $33 million ($36 million of net revenues and $3 million of related operating expenses) resulting from an agreement, which was part of an industry-wide settlement related to underpayments of Medicare inpatient prospective payments during a number of prior years, entered into with the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;      •    an aggregate unfavorable impact of $11 million resulting from a $7 million reduction to net revenues from the revised Supplemental Security Income ratios utilized for calculating Medicare disproportionate share hospital reimbursements for federal fiscal years 2006 through 2009 and a $4 million reduction to net revenues resulting from the write-off of receivables related to revenues recorded during 2011 at two of our acute care hospitals located in Florida resulting from reductions in certain county reimbursements due to reductions in federal matching Inter-Governmental Transfer funds;      •    the above-mentioned net charge of $10 million recorded during the second quarter of 2012 related to the revenues and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals, and;      •    other combined amounts aggregating to a net charge $4 million during the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 and income of $2 million recorded during the six-month period ended June 30, 2011.

Patient days and adjusted patient days increased 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively, during the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 14.2 days and 14.7 days during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 75% during each of the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, net revenue per adjusted admission increased 0.4% and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 3.5%, as compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year.    36    Table of Contents Six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011:  On a same facility basis, during the first six months of 2012, as compared to the comparable period of 2011, net revenues at our behavioral health care facilities increased 5% or $77 million to $1.72 billion from $1.64 billion. Income before income taxes increased $35 million or 9% to $413 million or 24.1% of net revenues during the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, as compared to $378 million or 23.0% of net revenues during the comparable period of 2011.  On a same facility basis, inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities increased 5.9% and 6.2%, respectively, during the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the comparable period of 2011. Patient days and adjusted patient days increased 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively, during the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the comparable period of 2011. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 14.0 days and 14.6 days during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities. Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.  Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge. The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient’s Medicare severity diagnosis related group (“MS-DRG”). Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care. This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity. While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an “outlier” payment if a particular patient’s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold.  MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the “hospital market basket index,” gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.  In July, 2010, CMS published its final IPPS 2011 payment rule which provided for a 2.6% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments were considered, our overall decrease from the federal fiscal year 2011 rule was 1.1%. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS was also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.25% in federal fiscal year 2011.  In August, 2011, CMS published its final IPPS 2012 payment rule which provided for a 3.0% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform productivity adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2012 rule will approximate 0.6%. CMS also includes a 2.0% market basket reduction related to prior year documentation and coding adjustments as well as a 1.1% increase related to the correction of a prior year wage index budget neutrality adjustment. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS was also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.10% in federal fiscal year 2012. The projected impact from this IPPS rule noted above reflects all of the adjustments described in this paragraph.  In August, 2012, CMS published its final IPPS 2013 payment rule which provided for a 2.6% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2013 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013) will approximate 1.8%. This projected impact from the IPPS 2013 final rule reflects all of the adjustments described in this paragraph, however, it excludes the impact of potential reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below.  In September, 2007, the “TMA, Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of 2007” legislation took effect and scaled back cuts in hospital reimbursement that CMS was set to impose. In federal fiscal years 2010 to 2012, the new law requires CMS to make adjustments to the Medicare standardized amounts in these years to reflect the removal of actual aggregate payment increases or decreases for documentation and coding adjustments that occurred during federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 as compared to the initial CMS estimates. In federal fiscal year 2010,    39    Table of Contents  CMS made its initial statutory mandated adjustment under this legislation and will continue to do so in subsequent fiscal years to ensure the implementation of MS-DRGs was budget neutral among all affected hospitals. In July, 2010, the IPPS 2011 proposed payment rule applied a 2.9% reduction to the 2011 market basket update and indicated another 2.9% reduction would also be applied in 2012 for documenting and coding. In this same rule, CMS indicated a remaining documenting and coding adjustment of 3.9% reduction is still required to be made to future IPPS updates. In the 2012 IPPS final rule, CMS offset 2.0% of this remaining reduction and has proposed to offset the remaining 1.9% in the IPPS 2013 payment rule described above.  On January 1, 2005, CMS implemented a new Psychiatric Prospective Payment System (“Psych PPS”) for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program. This system replaced the cost-based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem Psych PPS with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics. The Psych PPS also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. According to the April, 2010 CMS notice, the market basket increase was 2.4% for the period of July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011. In April, 2011 CMS published its final Psych PPS rule for the fifteen month period July 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012. The market basket increase for this time period is 2.95%, which includes a 0.25% reduction required by the federal Health Care Reform legislation enacted in 2010. In August, 2012 CMS published the federal year 2013 Psych PPS rate notice. The market basket increase for this period is 2.7% less required Health Care Reform legislation reductions totaling 0.8% for a net market basket increase of 1.9%.  In November 2010, CMS published its annual final Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”) rule for 2011. The final market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.46%. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.25% in federal fiscal year 2011. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, the overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2011 is estimated to be 3.2%.  In November, 2011, CMS published its annual final Medicare OPPS rule for 2012. The market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 3.0%. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.1% in federal fiscal year 2012 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity adjustment which is 1.1%. In the final rule, CMS is also implementing a significant decrease in the 2012 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center (CMHC) partial hospitalization programs. When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS payment decrease for 2012 is estimated to be 0.7%. Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2012 is estimated to be 2.1%.  In July, 2012, CMS published its annual proposed Medicare OPPS rule for 2013. The market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 3.0%. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.1% in federal fiscal year 2013 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity adjustment which is 0.8%. In the proposed rule, CMS is also implementing a significant increase in the 2013 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs. When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2013 is estimated to be 4.0%. Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2013 is estimated to be 2.2%.  In August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) was enacted into law. Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented which, if triggered, would result in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs starting in 2013. We cannot predict whether Congress will attempt to suspend or restructure the automatic budget cuts or what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress.  We entered into an agreement in April, 2012 with the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (referred to collectively as “HHS”) that resulted in an aggregate cash payment to us of approximately $36 million, the majority of which was received by June 30, 2012. After reductions for estimated related expenses and the portion attributable to third-party non-controlling ownership interests, this settlement favorably impacted our pre-tax consolidated financial results during the three-month period ended March 31, 2012 by approximately $30 million. This agreement was part of an industry-wide settlement with HHS related to litigation that was pending for several years contending that acute care hospitals in the U.S. were underpaid from the Medicare inpatient prospective payment system during a number of prior years. The underpayments resulted from calculations related to rural floor budget neutrality adjustments that were implemented in connection with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.  During March, 2012, CMS issued new Supplemental Security Income (“SSI”) ratios utilized for calculating Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital reimbursements (“Medicare DSH”) for federal fiscal years 2006 through 2009. As a result of these new SSI ratios, acute care hospitals are required to recalculate their Medicare DSH for the affected years and record adjustments for differences in estimated reimbursements. In addition, two of our acute care hospitals located in Florida were notified that the respective counties in which they operate were no longer funding the hospitals with certain reimbursements resulting from reductions in federal matching Inter-Governmental Transfer funds. As a result of the unfavorable adjustments required from the revised SSI ratios, and the write-off of receivables from certain counties located in Florida, our pre-tax consolidated financial results during the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 were unfavorably impacted by an aggregate of approximately $8 million (net of the portion attributable to third-party non-controlling ownership interests).    40    Table of Contents HITECH Act: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations implementing the health information technology (“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria. The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but we expect that all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate will ultimately choose to participate. Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful use” criteria. The government’s ultimate goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all Americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system.  During 2011, we began implementing EHR applications at certain of our acute care hospitals and will continue to do so, on a hospital-by-hospital basis, until completion which is scheduled to occur by the end of June, 2013. As of June 30, 2012, EHR applications have been implemented at nine of our acute care hospitals, the majority of which occurred during the second quarter of 2012. Our acute care hospitals will be eligible for Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application, assuming they meet the "meaningful use" criteria. One hospital met the "meaningful use" criteria during the first half of 2012 (occurred during the second quarter) and we anticipate that eight additional hospitals will qualify by the end of 2012.  Our consolidated results of operations for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 include a pre-tax charge (after portion attributable to third-party, noncontrolling interests) of approximately $8 million recorded in connection with the implementation of EHR applications. This charge, which is net of approximately $2 million attributable to third-party, noncontrolling ownership interests, consisted of $2 million of revenue offset by $8 million of salaries, wages, benefits and other operating expenses and $4 million of depreciation and amortization expense. The EHR-related revenue recorded during the second quarter of 2012 consists of state Medicaid EHR incentive payments attributable to an acute care hospital that met the "meaningful use" criteria during the quarter.  We have received an aggregate of approximately $15 million of state Medicaid, EHR incentive payments as of June 30, 2012. These payments, which are/were reflected as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet (included in other current liabilities), will be/were recorded as revenue in our consolidated statements of income in the periods in which the applicable hospitals are deemed to have met the “meaningful use” criteria. Upon meeting the “meaningful use” criteria, our hospitals we may become entitled to additional Medicaid incentive payments in future periods.  Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. Although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the HITECH Act.  Medicaid: Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.  We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Illinois, Massachusetts and Virginia, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs (which have been implemented in various forms with respect to our areas of operation in the respective 2013 state fiscal years) as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. In the states in which we operate, based upon the state budgets for the 2012 fiscal year (which generally began at various times during the second half of 2011), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates have been reduced by approximately 3% to 4% (or approximately $45 million to $55 million annually) from the average rates in effect during the states’ 2011 fiscal years (which generally ended during the third quarter of 2011). Our consolidated results of operations for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 include the pro rata portion of these Medicaid rate reductions. Based upon the state budgets for the 2013 fiscal year (which generally begin at various times during the second half of 2012), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates will be reduced by approximately .5% to 1% (or approximately $8 million to $15 million annually) from the average rates in effect during the states’ 2012 fiscal years (which generally end during the third quarter of 2012). We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.  Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hildalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in CMS-approved private Medicaid supplemental payment (“UPL”) programs. These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties. Our hospitals receive both UPL payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals. The UPL payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer (“IGT”) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals. We recorded net UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care revenues of $7million and $8 million during the three-month    41    Table of Contents  periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, $12 million and $18 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For state fiscal year 2012, Texas Medicaid will operate under a CMS-approved Section 1115 five-year Medicaid waiver demonstration program. During the first five years of this program, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (“THHSC”) will transition away from UPL payments to new waiver incentive payment programs. During the first year of transition, which commenced on October 1, 2011, THHSC will make payments to Medicaid UPL recipient providers that received payments during the state’s prior fiscal year. During transition years two through five, THHSC will make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria are met by hospitals. If the applicable hospital district or county makes IGTs consistent with 2011 levels, we believe we would be entitled to aggregate net revenues earned pursuant to these programs of approximately $12 million during the period of July 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012.  We incur health-care related taxes (“Provider Taxes”) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items of services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services. Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching dollars as part of their respective state Medicaid programs. We derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments. We earned an aggregate net benefit of approximately $5 million and $4 million during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $10 million and $9 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, from Medicaid supplemental payments, after assessed Provider Taxes were considered (exclusive of our hospitals located in Oklahoma, Indiana and Ohio, as discussed below). Excluding Oklahoma, Indiana and Ohio, we estimate that our aggregate net benefit from these Provider Tax programs will approximate $13 million during the remaining six months of 2012. The aggregate net benefit is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state’s portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements. However, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated future results of operations.  In January, 2012, the state of Oklahoma was granted federal approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) for the Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program (“SHOPP”) which grants the Oklahoma Health Care Authority the authority to assess a 2.5% fee on certain Oklahoma hospitals and to make Medicaid supplemental payments to hospitals through December 31, 2014, retroactive to July 1, 2011. The state finalized the initial supplemental payment program amounts in March, 2012. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the SHOPP program during the state’s fiscal years of 2012 and 2013, we estimate that we are entitled to annual net reimbursements of approximately $14 million, retroactive to July 1, 2011. Our pre-tax consolidated financial results for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 were favorably impacted by approximately $3 million and $14 million, respectively, consisting of revenues related to the SHOPP program covering the period of July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012.  In addition, during the second quarter of 2012, new supplemental Medicaid programs were initiated in Indiana and Ohio in which we operate behavioral health care facilities. Our pre-tax consolidated financial results for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 were each favorably impacted by approximately $9 million recorded in connection with these programs which were retroactive to July, 2011.  In California, a Medicaid state plan amendment (“SPA”) was submitted to CMS by the state requesting and extension of a prior provider tax and related Medicaid supplemental payment program retroactive to July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013. In June, 2012, CMS approved a portion of the SPA which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012. Approval of the additional SPA component related to Medicaid managed care supplemental payments would have a favorable impact on our future results of operations.  Managed Care: A significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs. In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow. The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate. Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.  Commercial Insurance: Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance. Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital’s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy. Private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.  Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services. To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers’ reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.  Other Sources: Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage. Such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals’ indigent and charity care policy. Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.    42    Table of Contents State Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: Hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) adjustment. Congress established a national limit on DSH adjustments. Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the Medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse.  Upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas’ and South Carolina’s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received additional reimbursement from each state’s DSH fund. The Texas and South Carolina programs have been renewed for each state’s 2012 fiscal years (covering the period of October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012 for each state). In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of $12 million and $11 million during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $23 million during each of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011.  In April, 2012, the THHSC published a proposed rule that would change the Texas Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (“Texas Medicaid DSH”) methodology, which, if implemented, would have reduced reimbursements to us effective July 1, 2012. However, the THHSC has not yet implemented the final rule. Although we can provide no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of this rule, or its ultimate impact on our consolidated financial results, if this proposed rule is implemented as currently drafted, our future Texas Medicaid DSH reimbursements could be reduced by approximately $16 million annually in the period following its implementation. As of June 30, 2012, we have approximately $7 million of receivables recorded in connection with Texas Medicaid DSH reimbursements covering the period of October, 2011 through June, 2012 ($1 million of which was paid to us in July, 2012). Although at this time we expect to fully collect the remainder of the Texas Medicaid DSH receivables, as previously disclosed, since receipt of the Texas Medicaid DSH reimbursements is contingent on certain public hospitals in Texas making Inter-Governmental Transfers to the state, we can provide no assurance that we will ultimately collect all of the estimated amounts due to us.  Assuming that the South Carolina DSH program is renewed for the state’s 2013 fiscal year at amounts similar to the 2012 fiscal year program, and assuming the Texas DSH program is renewed for the state’s 2013 fiscal year at an reduced annual rate as contemplated in the above-mentioned proposed rule (assuming a $16 million annual reduction effective October 1, 2012), we estimate our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs to be approximately $16 million during the remaining six months of 2012. Failure to renew these DSH programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary IGTs for the states’ share of the DSH programs, failure of our hospitals that currently receive DSH payments to qualify for future DSH funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.  Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform: Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, the War on Terrorism, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, the expansion of a Medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.  In March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872, P.L. 111-152) (the “Reconciliation Act”), and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), (the “Affordable Care Act”), were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below.  Immediate Medicare Reductions:  The Reconciliation Act reduced the market basket update for inpatient and outpatient hospitals and inpatient behavioral health facilities by 0.25% in each of 2010 and 2011 and by 0.10% in 2012 and 2013. Further, the Affordable Care Act implemented certain reforms to Medicare Advantage payments, effective in 2011.  Future Medicare Reductions:  Future changes to the Medicare program include:        •    A Medicare shared savings program (effective 2012)        •    A hospital readmissions reduction program (effective 2012)        •    A national pilot program on payment bundling (effective 2013)        •    A value-based purchasing program for hospitals (effective 2012)        •    Reduction to Medicare disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) payments (effective 2014)    43    Table of Contents Medicaid Revisions:        •    Expanded Medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments (effective 2014)        •    Reduction to Medicaid DSH (effective 2014)  Health Insurance Revisions:        •    Large employer insurance reforms (effective 2014)        •    Individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies (effective 2014)        •    Federally mandated insurance coverage reforms (2010 and forward)  Although the above-mentioned Medicare market basket reductions implemented in 2010 did not have a material impact on our results of operations to date, we are unable to estimate the future impact of the other legislative changes as outlined above.  In addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities. The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers’ rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments. Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.  Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.  Other Operating Results   The combined net revenues and income before income taxes generated at our surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers was not material to our results of operations during each of the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011.  Interest Expense:  Interest expense was $46 million and $50 million during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $93 million and $106 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Below is a schedule of our interest expense for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 (amounts in thousands):                            Three MonthsEndedJune 30,2012     Three MonthsEndedJune 30,2011     Six MonthsEndedJune 30,2012     Six MonthsEndedJune 30,2011     Revolving credit & demand notes   $ 1,540     $ 1,868     $ 3,180     $ 4,037     $200 million, 6.75% Senior Notes due 2011 (a.)     —        3,377       —        6,755     $400 million, 7.125% Senior Notes due 2016 (b.)     7,124       7,124       14,248       14,248     $250 million, 7.00% Senior Notes due 2018     4,375       4,375       8,750       8,750     Term loan facility A     5,576       6,724       11,370       15,480     Term loan facility B     13,712       14,873       27,825       35,244     Accounts receivable securitization program     707       676       1,394       1,341                                               Subtotal-revolving credit, demand notes, Senior Notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program     33,034       39,017       66,767       85,855     Interest rate swap expense, net     5,285       2,198       10,443       3,603     Amortization of financing fees     7,289       7,236       14,566       13,781     Other combined interest expense     1,610       1,450       3,186       3,123     Capitalized interest on major construction and other projects     (1,310 )      (51 )      (2,315 )      (51 )    Interest income     (20 )      (42 )      (49 )      (86 )                                              Interest expense, net   $ 45,888     $ 49,808     $ 92,598     $ 106,225                                                  (a.) The $200 million, 6.75% Senior Notes matured and were paid in full on November 15, 2011 utilizing borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit agreement.    44    Table of Contents   (b.) In June, 2008, we issued an additional $150 million of senior notes (the “Notes”) which formed a single series with the original $250 million of Notes issued in June, 2006 (see Note 4—Long-term debt and cash flow hedges). Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to, and trade interchangeably with, the Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006. The proceeds from this issuance were used to repay outstanding borrowings.  Interest expense decreased $4 million and $14 million during the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, as compared to the comparable periods of 2011. The decreased interest expense during the second quarter of 2012, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2011, was due primarily to a decrease in our average outstanding borrowings and a decrease in our average effective borrowing rate (due primarily to the repayment of the $200 million, 6.75% Senior Notes in November, 2011 utilizing borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit agreement which are borrowed at a lower interest rate), partially offset by an increase in our net interest rate swap expense. The decreased interest during the first six months of 2012, as compared to the comparable period of 2011, was due primarily to a decrease in our average outstanding borrowings and a decrease in our average effective interest rate (due primarily to the above-mentioned repayment of the $200 million, 6.75% Senior Notes in November, 2011 and an amendment to our credit agreement in March of 2011 which, among other things, provided for reductions in the rates payable for borrowings outstanding under our Term Loan A, Term Loan B and revolving credit facility), partially offset by an increase in our net interest rate swap expense.  Discontinued Operations  We executed a definitive agreement to sell Auburn Regional Medical Center (“Auburn”), a 213-bed acute care hospital located in Auburn, Washington, for total cash proceeds of approximately $98 million including estimated working capital. The transaction, which is subject to customary regulatory approvals, is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect to realize a substantial gain on the divestiture of this hospital which will be recorded in our consolidated financial statements upon closing of the transaction.  In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI facilities (Meadowood Behavioral Health System, Montevista Hospital and Red Rock Hospital) as well as one of our legacy behavioral health facilities in Puerto Rico (San Juan Capestrano). Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the FTC, we divested:        •    in July, 2011, the Meadowood Behavioral Health System, a 58-bed facility located in New Castle, Delaware;        •    in December, 2011, the Montevista Hospital (101-bed) and Red Rock Hospital (21-bed), both of which are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, and;        •    in January, 2012, the Hospital San Juan Capestrano, a 108-bed facility located in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.  The operating results for Auburn and the three former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada are reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership for each of the periods presented herein. Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses. The aggregate pre-tax net gain on the divestiture of San Juan Capestrano in January, 2012 did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during the first quarter of 2012. Assets and liabilities for Auburn are reflected as “held for sale” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2012, and the assets and liabilities for the Hospital San Juan Capestrano were reflected as “held for sale” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011.  The following table shows the results of operations for Auburn and the former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada, on a combined basis, which were reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership for each of the periods presented herein (amounts in thousands):                            Three months ended     Six months ended        June 30,     June 30,     June 30,     June 30,        2012     2011     2012     2011     Net revenues   $ 26,318     $ 36,996     $ 54,017     $ 78,155     (Loss) income from discontinued operations, before income taxes     (2,211 )      930       (2,676 )      6,964     Income tax benefit (expense)     847       (352 )      1,025       (2,637 )                                              (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes     ($1,364 )    $ 578       ($1,651 )    $ 4,327                                                45    Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates:  The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands):                            Three months ended     Six months ended        June 30,     June 30,     June 30,     June 30,        2012     2011     2012     2011     Provision for income taxes   $ 67,000     $ 66,395     $ 146,748     $ 140,404     Income before income taxes     184,444       182,429       406,762       386,425                                               Effective tax rate     36.3 %      36.4 %      36.1 %      36.3 %                                             Outside owners hold various noncontrolling, minority ownership interests in seven of our acute care facilities and one behavioral health care facility. Each of these facilities are owned and operated by limited liability companies (“LLC”) or limited partnerships (“LP”). As a result, since there is no income tax liability incurred at the LLC/LP level (since it passes through to the members/partners), the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests does not include any income tax provision/benefit. When computing the provision for income taxes, as reflected on our consolidated statements of income, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from income before income taxes since it represents the third-party members’/partners’ share of the income generated by the joint-venture entities. In addition to providing the effective tax rates, as indicated above (as calculated from dividing the provision for income taxes by the income before income taxes as reflected on the consolidated statements of income), we believe it is helpful to our investors that we also provide our effective tax rate as calculated after giving effect to the portion of our pre-tax income that is attributable to the third-party members/partners.  The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income before income taxes, minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for each of the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands):                            Three months ended     Six months ended        June 30,     June 30,     June 30,     June 30,        2012     2011     2012     2011     Provision for income taxes   $ 67,000     $ 66,395     $ 146,748     $ 140,404     Income before income taxes     184,444       182,429       406,762       386,425     Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests     (9,883 )      (12,385 )      (23,846 )      (28,179 )                                              Income before income taxes and after net income attributable to noncontrolling interests     174,561       170,044       382,916       358,246                                               Effective tax rate     38.4 %      39.0 %      38.3 %      39.2 %                                             The decreases in the effective tax rates during the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, as compared to the comparable periods of 2011, were primarily attributable to a decrease in our blended effective state income tax rate.  Liquidity   Net cash provided by operating activities  Net cash provided by operating activities was $373 million during the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 and $356 million during the comparable period of 2011. The net increase of $17 million was primarily attributable to the following:        •    a favorable change of $20 million due to an increase in net income plus depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation;        •    a $51 million unfavorable change in accrued and deferred income taxes due primarily to the income tax payments during the first six months of 2011 being favorably impacted/reduced by an overpayment relating to 2010;        •    a $35 million favorable change in other working capital accounts due primarily to the timing of accounts payable and accrued compensation payments, and;        •    $13 million of other combined net favorable changes.    46    Table of Contents Days sales outstanding (“DSO”): Our DSO are calculated by dividing our net revenue by the number of days in the six-month periods. The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance at June 30th of each year to obtain the DSO. Our DSO were 53 days at June 30, 2012 and 47 days at June 30, 2011.  Contributing to the increase in our DSO as of June 30, 2012, as compared to June 30, 2011, was an increase in receivables from the state of Illinois. As of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, our accounts receivable includes approximately $72 million and $54 million, respectively, due from Illinois. Collection of these receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures. Approximately $52 million as of June 30, 2012, and $41 million as of December 31, 2011, of the receivables due from Illinois have been outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date, and a large portion will likely remain outstanding for the foreseeable future. Since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements. However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois. Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from Illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.  Net cash used in investing activities  During the first six months of 2012, we used $162 million of net cash in investing activities as follows:        •    spent $182 million to finance capital expenditures including capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities, including the construction costs related to the newly constructed Temecula Valley Hospital, a 140-bed acute care facility located in Temecula, California which is scheduled to be completed and opened in mid-2013 and additional capacity at certain of our behavioral health facilities;        •    spent $28 million in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application;        •    received $53 million in connection with the divestiture of the Hospital San Juan Capestrano and the divestiture of the real property of a previously closed behavioral health care facility;        •    spent $11 million in connection with the acquisition of a physician practice and various real property, and;        •    received $7 million from a deposit returned to us in connection with the termination of an agreement to purchase an acute care hospital located in Texas (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  During the first six months of 2011, we used $126 million of net cash in investing activities as follows:        •    spent $116 million to finance capital expenditures including capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities;        •    spent $11 million in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application, and;        •    received $2 million of proceeds for the sale of the real property of a closed acute care facility and for sale of our ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center.  Net cash provided by/used in financing activities  During the first six months of 2012, we used $219 million of net cash in financing activities as follows:        •    spent $196 million on net repayments of debt due primarily to repayments pursuant to our Term Loan A ($36 million), Term Loan B ($13 million), revolving credit ($126 million), accounts receivable securitization ($10 million) and short-term, on demand ($9 million) facilities;        •    spent $14 million to pay profit distributions related to noncontrolling interests in majority owned businesses;        •    spent $3 million to repurchase shares of our Class B Common Stock;        •    spent $10 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $.05 per share, and;        •    generated $3 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans.  During the first six months of 2011, we used $225 million of net cash in financing activities as follows:        •    spent $201 million on net repayments of debt due primarily to repayments pursuant to our Term Loan A, Term Loan B and revolving credit facilities;        •    generated $36 million of cash from additional borrowings pursuant to our accounts receivable securitization program;        •    spent $24 million on financing costs in connection with an amendment to our credit agreement (which includes our revolving credit agreement, Term Loan A and Term Loan B facilities) which was completed in March, 2011;        •    spent $23 million to pay profit distributions related to noncontrolling interests in majority owned businesses;        •    spent $6 million to repurchase shares of our Class B Common Stock;        •    spent $10 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $.05 per share, and;        •    generated $2 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans.    47    Table of Contents Agreement to Acquire Ascend Health Corporation:  In June, 2012, we executed a definitive agreement to acquire Ascend Health Corporation (“Ascend”) for $500 million in cash. Including the assumption of $17 million in Ascend net debt, the total transaction consideration is approximately $517 million. Ascend is the largest private psychiatric hospital provider with 9 owned or leased freestanding psychiatric inpatient facilities located in 5 states including Texas, Arizona, Utah, Oregon and Washington. We expect to complete the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2012, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.  Expected Capital Expenditures During the Remainder of 2012:  During the remaining six months of 2012, we expect to spend approximately $175 million to $190 million on capital expenditures. We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and/or additional funds, as discussed below.  Capital Resources   Credit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities  On November 15, 2010, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with various financial institutions. The Credit Agreement is a senior secured facility which provided an initial aggregate commitment amount of $3.45 billion, comprised of a new $800 million revolving credit facility, a $1.05 billion Term Loan A facility and a $1.6 billion Term Loan B facility. Prior to the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement Amendment in March, 2011 (as discussed below), we prepaid the principal amount and permanently reduced the Term Loan B commitment by $125 million. During the first six months of 2012, we made scheduled principal payments of $36 million on the Term Loan A and $13 million on the Term Loan B. The revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A mature on November 15, 2015 and the Term Loan B matures on November 15, 2016. The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.  On March 15, 2011, we entered into a first amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”) which became effective immediately and provides, among other things, for a reduction in the interest rates payable in connection with borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Upon the effectiveness of the Amendment, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to, at our election (1) the greatest of (a) the lender’s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month Eurodollar rate plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit and Term Loan A borrowings and 1.75% to 2.00% for Term Loan B borrowings or (2) the one, two, three or six month Eurodollar rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit and Term Loan A borrowings and ranging from 2.75% to 3.00% for Term Loan B borrowings. The current applicable margins are 0.75% for ABR-based loans, 1.75% for Eurodollar-based loans under the revolving credit and Term Loan A facilities and 2.75% under the Term Loan B facility. Upon the effectiveness of the Amendment, the minimum Eurodollar rate for the Term Loan B facility was reduced from 1.50% to 1.00%. In connection with the Amendment, we paid a fee of 1.00% of the amounts outstanding under the Term Loan B in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.  As of June 30, 2012, we had $623 million of available borrowing capacity pursuant to the terms of our Credit Agreement, net of $115 million of outstanding borrowings and $62 million of outstanding letters of credit.  In October, 2010, we amended our accounts receivable securitization program (“Securitization”) with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks. We increased the size of the Securitization to $240 million (the “Commitments”), from $200 million, and extended the maturity date to October 25, 2013. In May, 2012, we further increased the size of the securitization by $35 million to $275 million. Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals (“Receivables”) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings. The interest rate on the borrowings is based on the commercial paper rate plus a spread of 0.475% and there is a facility fee of 0.375% required on 102% on the Commitments. We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings. We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us. The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities. The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks. The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans. At June 30, 2012, we had $230 million of outstanding borrowings and $45 million of additional capacity pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program.  As of June 30, 2012, we had no outstanding borrowings under a short-term, on-demand credit facility. When applicable, outstanding borrowings pursuant to this facility are classified as long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet since we have the intent and ability to refinance through available borrowings under the terms of our Credit Agreement.      48    Table of Contents On September 29, 2010, we issued $250 million of 7.00% senior unsecured notes (the “Unsecured Notes”) which are scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018. The Unsecured Notes were registered in April, 2011. Interest on the Unsecured Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on April 1st and October 1st of each year. The Unsecured Notes can be redeemed in whole at anytime subject to a make-whole call at treasury rate plus 50 basis points prior to October 1, 2014. They are also redeemable in whole or in part at a price of: (i) 103.5% on or after October 1, 2014; (ii) 101.75% on or after October 1, 2015, and; (iii) 100% on or after October 1, 2016. These Unsecured Notes are guaranteed by a group of subsidiaries (each of which is a 100% directly owned subsidiary of Universal Health Services, Inc.) which fully and unconditionally guarantee the Unsecured Notes on a joint and several basis, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions.  On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior notes which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016 (the “7.125% Notes”). Interest on the 7.125% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 30th and December 30th of each year. In June, 2008, we issued an additional $150 million of 7.125% Notes which formed a single series with the original 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2006. Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to and trade interchangeably with, the 7.125% Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006.  In connection with the entering into of the Credit Agreement on November 15, 2010, and in accordance with the Indenture dated January 20, 2000 governing the rights of our existing notes, we entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which our 7.125% Notes (due in 2016) were equally and ratably secured with the lenders under the Credit Agreement with respect to the collateral for so long as the lenders under the Credit Agreement are so secured.  Our Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates and dividends; and requires compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as of June 30, 2012.  The carrying amount and fair value of our debt was $3.46 billion and $3.53 billion at June 30, 2012, respectively. The fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions and we consider these to be “level 2” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with debt instruments.  Our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 58% at June 30, 2012 and 61% at December 31, 2011.  We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay dividends and potentially repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) the issuance of equity; (ii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility or through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement, and/or; (iii) the issuance of other long-term debt. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   During the three months ended June 30, 2012, there have been no material changes in the off-balance sheet arrangements consisting of operating leases and standby letters of credit and surety bonds. Reference is made to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.  We have various obligations under operating leases or master leases for real property and under operating leases for equipment. The real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income. We sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received from these subleases are offset against the expense. In addition, we lease four hospital facilities from Universal Health Realty Income Trust with terms scheduled to expire in 2014 and 2016. These leases contain up to four, 5-year renewal options.  As of June 30, 2012, we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled $81 million consisting of: (i) $65 million related to our self-insurance programs, and; (ii) $16 million of other debt and public utility guarantees.      Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   There have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures during the three months ended June 30, 2012. Reference is made to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.      Item 4. Controls and Procedures   As of June 30, 2012, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in    49    Table of Contents  Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure obligations under the 1934 Act and the SEC rules thereunder.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the second quarter of 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION       Item 1. Legal Proceedings   We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to litigation, as outlined below.  Martin v. UHS of Delaware:  UHS of Delaware, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, has been named as defendants in a state False Claim Act case in Sacramento County Superior Court. Plaintiffs are a former student and employees of the Elmira School who claim that the UHS schools in California unlawfully retained public education funding from the state of California for the operation of these schools but failed to meet state requirements pertaining to the operation of non-public schools. During the second quarter of 2012, we reached a settlement in connection with this matter which requires finalization of a definitive agreement which is subject to approval of the California Attorney General’s Office and Superior Court presiding over the case. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Department of Justice ICD Investigation:  In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (“ICDs”) from 2003 to the present at several of our acute care facilities. The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Claims Determination regarding these devices. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital:  In April, 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued notice of its decision terminating Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital (“Two Rivers”) in Kansas City, Missouri from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid program. The termination notice was issued as a result of surveys conducted which allegedly found Two Rivers to be out of compliance with the conditions of participation required for participation in the Medicare program and for Two Rivers’ alleged failure to alleviate an “immediate jeopardy” situation. Two Rivers filed an administrative appeal with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Departmental Appeal Board, Civil Remedies Division, seeking review and reversal of that decision. In addition, Two Rivers filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against CMS rescinding the termination action. Later in April, 2011, the District Court issued a temporary restraining order abating the termination action pending a preliminary injunction hearing or an agreement with CMS. In May, 2011, Two Rivers and CMS entered into a settlement agreement which resulted in the rescission of the termination notice and actions by CMS. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Two Rivers was required to submit an acceptable plan of correction relative to the immediate jeopardy citation and engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for Two Rivers to meet the applicable Medicare conditions of participation. Both of these actions have occurred. Pursuant to the agreement, CMS conducted an initial survey of Two Rivers in April 2012 to determine if the Medicare conditions of participation, which formed the basis of the termination action in April 2011, have been met. In late April, 2012, CMS advised Two Rivers that it has successfully passed this initial survey. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, a second survey will be conducted either late 2012 or early 2013 to further confirm that Two Rivers is in compliance with all Medicare/Medicaid Conditions of Participation. During the term of this agreement, Two Rivers remains eligible to receive reimbursements for services rendered to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Two Rivers remains fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their patients and the community it serves. We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with CMS in an effort to resolve these matters. We can provide no assurance that Two Rivers will not ultimately lose its Medicare certification. The operating results of Two Rivers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 or the year ended December 31, 2011.  Office of Inspector General Investigation of Peachford Hospital:  In July, 2012, one of our subsidiaries, Peachford Behavioral Health System of Atlanta located in Atlanta, Georgia, received a subpoena from the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services requesting various documents from 2004 to the present. We are in the process of securing and collecting the requested documents for production. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.    50    Table of Contents Matters Relating to PSI:  The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.) for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition of PSI which was completed in November, 2010:  Garden City Employees’ Retirement System v. PSI:  This is a purported shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against PSI and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws. We intend to defend the case vigorously. Should we be deemed liable in this matter, we believe we would be entitled to commercial insurance recoveries for amounts paid by us, subject to certain limitations and deductibles. Included in our consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, is an estimated reserve (current liability) and corresponding commercial insurance recovery (current asset) which did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Although we believe the commercial insurance recoveries are adequate to satisfy potential liability and related legal fees in connection with this matter, we can provide no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed the commercial insurance recoveries which would make us liable for the excess.  Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:  In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility. The requested documents have been collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination. Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July 2011 requesting additional documents, a portion of which have been collected and delivered to the DOJ, pursuant to their request. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.  Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital:  In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility. Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010. The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ and we continue to cooperate with the DOJ with respect to this investigation. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.  Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services Recoupment Claims:  The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (“DMAS”) has conducted audits at seven former PSI Residential Treatment Centers operated in the Commonwealth of Virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the state’s Medicaid Provider Services Manual (“Manual”). As a result of those audits, DMAS claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities. PSI had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending. The aggregate refund of Medicaid payments made to those facilities, as requested by DMAS, and the corresponding reserve established on our consolidated balance sheet, was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  General:  The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers. Currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.  The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes. It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.    51    Table of Contents In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.      Item 1A. Risk Factors   Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 includes a listing of risk factors to be considered by investors in our securities. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.      Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
