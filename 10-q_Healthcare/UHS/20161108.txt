Item 1A Risk Factors and in Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors. Those factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any of our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following:        •  our ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations, and/or changes in laws and government regulations;        •  an increasing number of legislative initiatives have been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level. No assurances can be given that the implementation of these laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations;        •  possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government based payors, including Medicare or Medicaid in the United States, and government based payors in the United Kingdom;        •  our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same, including contracts with United/Sierra Healthcare in Las Vegas, Nevada; 21         •  the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us and other matters as disclosed in Item 1. Legal Proceedings;        •  the potential unfavorable impact on our business of deterioration in national, regional and local economic and business conditions, including a worsening of unfavorable credit market conditions;        •  competition from other healthcare providers (including physician owned facilities) in certain markets;        •  technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;        •  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals;        •  demographic changes;        •  our ability to successfully integrate and improve our recent acquisitions and the availability of suitable acquisitions and divestiture opportunities;        •  as discussed below in Sources of Revenue, we receive revenues from various state and county based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate, (we receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $100 million annually from each of Texas, California, Washington, D.C., Nevada, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Massachusetts and Virginia); CMS-approved Medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including Texas, Illinois, Oklahoma, Mississippi, California, Ohio and Arkansas, and; state Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including Texas and South Carolina. We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. We can provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;        •  our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund the future growth of our business;        •  some of our acute care facilities experience decreasing inpatient admission trends;        •  our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;        •  in March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. The two combined primary goals of these acts are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses. Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade. We cannot predict the effect, if any, these enactments will have on our future results of operations;        •  the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations in July, 2010 implementing the health information technology (“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore were not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015. However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year. Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations. There will likely be timing differences in the recognition of the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the EHR applications which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of operations; 22         •  in August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) was enacted into law. The 2011 Act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the “Joint Committee”), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (annual reduction of approximately $36 million to our Medicare net revenues) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, continued the 2% reductions to Medicare reimbursement imposed under the 2011 Act. We cannot predict whether Congress will restructure the implemented Medicare payment reductions or what other federal budget deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress going forward;        •  there have been several attempts in Congress to repeal or modify various provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”). We cannot predict whether or not any of these proposed changes to the PPACA will become law and therefore can provide no assurance that changes to the PPACA, as currently implemented, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;        •  uninsured and self-pay patients treated at our acute care facilities unfavorably impact our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our self-pay patient accounts;        •  the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance on current terms;        •  changes in our business strategies or development plans;        •  fluctuations in the value of our common stock, and;        •  other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Given these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. We assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenue recognition: We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided. Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 32% and 34% of our net patient revenues during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 32% and 34% of our net patient revenues for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs, accounted for 56% and 55% of our net patient revenues during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 56% and 54% of our net patient revenues during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts: See disclosure below in Results of Operations, Acute Care Hospital Services- Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts. Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks: We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers’ compensation claims. Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for  23  professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense. In addition, we also: (i) own commercial health insurers headquartered in Reno, Nevada, and Puerto Rico, and; (ii) maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims. The ultimate costs related to these programs/operations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported. Given our significant insurance-related exposure, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. The total accrual for our professional and general liability claims and workers’ compensation claims was $278 million as of September 30, 2016, of which $82 million is included in current liabilities. The total accrual for our professional and general liability claims and workers’ compensation claims was $271 million as of December 31, 2015, of which $82 million is included in current liabilities. Recent Accounting Standards: For a summary of accounting standards, please see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as included herein.

The net increase was primarily attributable to: (i) a $131 million or 6% increase in net revenues generated from our acute care hospital services and behavioral health services operated during both periods (which we refer to as “same facility”), and; (ii) $51 million of other combined revenue increases consisting primarily of the revenues generated at 4 inpatient facilities and 8 outpatient centers acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of our acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network, LLC (“Foundations”). Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) decreased $3 million to $245 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $248 million during the comparable quarter of the prior year. The net decrease in our income before income taxes during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2015, was due to:        •  an increase of $6 million at our acute care facilities as discussed below in Acute Care Hospital Services; 24         •  a decrease of $4 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in Behavioral Health Services, and;        •  $5 million of other combined net decreases including a $5 million increase in interest expense due primarily to increased aggregate average outstanding borrowings. Net income attributable to UHS increased $2 million to $152 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $150 million during the comparable prior year quarter. The increase during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, consisted of:        •  a decrease of $3 million in income before income taxes, as discussed above;        •  an increase of $8 million resulting from a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests due primarily to the May, 2016 purchase of the minority ownership interests held by a third-party in six acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada, as discussed herein, and;         •  a decrease of $3 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded on the $5 million increase in pre-tax income ($3 million decrease in income before income taxes plus the $8 million decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interests).   Nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: The following table summarizes our results of operations and is used in the discussion below for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands):           Nine months ended September 30, 2016        Nine months ended September 30, 2015             Amount        % of Net Revenues        Amount        % of Net Revenues       Net revenues before provision for doubtful accounts     $  7,869,352                    $  7,271,852                   Less: Provision for doubtful accounts        578,827                       543,640                   Net revenues        7,290,525           100.0  %        6,728,212           100.0  %    Operating charges:                                                    Salaries, wages and benefits        3,428,801           47.0  %        3,132,993           46.6  %    Other operating expenses        1,744,849           23.9  %        1,571,060           23.4  %    Supplies expense        767,465           10.5  %        721,979           10.7  %    Depreciation and amortization        309,172           4.2  %        295,697           4.4  %    Lease and rental expense        73,057           1.0  %        70,631           1.0  %    EHR incentive income        0           —           (1,751  )        (0.0  )%    Subtotal-operating expenses        6,323,344           86.7  %        5,790,609           86.1  %    Income from operations        967,181           13.3  %        937,603           13.9  %    Interest expense, net        92,171           1.3  %        84,851           1.3  %    Income before income taxes        875,010           12.0  %        852,752           12.7  %    Provision for income taxes        306,577           4.2  %        293,371           4.4  %    Net income        568,433           7.8  %        559,381           8.3  %    Less: Income attributable to noncontrolling interests        40,232           0.6  %        52,602           0.8  %    Net income attributable to UHS     $  528,201           7.2  %     $  506,779           7.5  %     Net revenues increased 8%, or $562 million, to $7.29 billion during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $6.73 billion during the first nine months of 2015. The net increase was primarily attributable to: (i) a $410 million or 6% increase in net revenues generated from our acute care hospital services and behavioral health services operated during both periods, and; (ii) $152 million of other combined revenue increases consisting primarily of the revenues generated at 4 behavioral health care hospitals acquired in the U.K. in connection with our acquisition of Alpha Hospitals Holdings Limited (“Alpha”) during the third quarter of 2015 and 4 inpatient facilities and 8 outpatient centers acquired during the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of our acquisition of Foundations. Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $22 million to $875 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $853 million during the comparable period of the prior year. The net increase in our income before income taxes during the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the comparable period of 2015, was due to:        •  an increase of $33 million at our acute care facilities as discussed below in Acute Care Hospital Services; 25         •  an increase of $12 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in Behavioral Health Services, and;        •  $23 million of other combined net decreases including an $8 million increase in interest expense due primarily to increased aggregate average outstanding borrowings.  Net income attributable to UHS increased $21 million to $528 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $507 million during the comparable prior year period. The increase during the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the comparable prior year period, consisted of:        •  an increase of $22 million in income before income taxes, as discussed above;        •  an increase of $12 million resulting from a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests due primarily to the above-mentioned purchase of the minority ownership interests held by a third-party in six acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada, and;         •  a decrease of $13 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded on the $34 million increase in pre-tax income ($22 million increase in income before income taxes plus the $12 million decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interests). Acute Care Hospital Services Same Facility Basis Acute Care Hospital Services We believe that providing our results on a “Same Facility” basis (which is a non-GAAP measure), which includes the operating results for facilities and businesses operated in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance. Our Same Facility results also neutralize the impact of the EHR applications, the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods. Our Same Facility basis results reflected on the tables below also exclude from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below Sources of Revenue-Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs. However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under All Acute Care Hospitals. The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses. To obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance, the Same Facility results should be examined in connection with our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis and is used in the discussion below for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands):             Three months ended        Three months ended        Nine months ended        Nine months ended             September 30, 2016        September 30, 2015        September 30, 2016        September 30, 2015             Amount        % of Net Revenues        Amount        % of Net Revenues        Amount        % of Net Revenues        Amount        % of Net Revenues       Net revenues before provision for doubtful accounts     $  1,394,161                    $  1,305,789                    $  4,209,864                    $  3,855,250                   Less: Provision for doubtful accounts        172,292                       185,232                       491,033                       458,879                   Net revenues        1,221,869           100.0  %        1,120,557           100.0  %        3,718,831           100.0  %        3,396,371           100.0  %    Operating charges:                                                                                                    Salaries, wages and benefits        524,814           43.0  %        482,670           43.1  %        1,540,309           41.4  %        1,403,659           41.3  %    Other operating expenses        307,714           25.2  %        271,745           24.3  %        893,530           24.0  %        792,745           23.3  %    Supplies expense        210,036           17.2  %        194,385           17.3  %        620,067           16.7  %        576,910           17.0  %    Depreciation and amortization        58,323           4.8  %        57,102           5.1  %        172,899           4.6  %        170,645           5.0  %    Lease and rental expense        12,095           1.0  %        12,612           1.1  %        38,766           1.0  %        37,532           1.1  %    Subtotal-operating expenses        1,112,982           91.1  %        1,018,514           90.9  %        3,265,571           87.8  %        2,981,491           87.8  %    Income from operations        108,887           8.9  %        102,043           9.1  %        453,260           12.2  %        414,880           12.2  %    Interest expense, net        817           0.1  %        1,099           0.1  %        2,460           0.1  %        3,290           0.1  %    Income before income taxes     $  108,070           8.8  %     $  100,944           9.0  %     $  450,800           12.1  %     $  411,590           12.1  %     26  Three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: During the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, net revenues from our acute care hospital services, on a same facility basis, increased $101 million or 9.0%. Income before income taxes (and before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $7 million or 7% to $108 million or 8.8% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $101 million or 9.0% of net revenues during the comparable prior year quarter.

Income before income taxes increased $6 million or 6% to $98 million during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $92 million during the third quarter of 2015. The increase in income before income taxes at our acute care facilities resulted from:        •  a $7 million increase at our acute care facilities on a same facility basis, as discussed above, and;        •  a decrease of $1 million from other combined net changes. Nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the comparable prior year period, net revenues from our acute care hospital services increased $348 million or 10.1% due primarily to the above-mentioned $322 million or 9.5% increase in net revenues on a same facility basis. Income before income taxes increased $33 million or 9% to $421 million during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to $388 million during the first nine months of 2015. The increase in income before income taxes at our acute care facilities resulted from:        •  a $39 million increase at our acute care facilities on a same facility basis, as discussed above, and;        •  a decrease of $6 million from other combined net changes. Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient’s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles. We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account. For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters. Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old. All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge. Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge. Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy. If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort. Historically, a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high  28  deductibles. Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care. The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net. A portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states. Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient’s responsible party at the time of registration. At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned. There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered. Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible. When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending, our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates, subject to the ultimate disposition of the patient’s Medicaid eligibility. When the patient’s ultimate eligibility is determined, reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending. Although the patient’s ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period, these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible. We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in “uninsured discounts” amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable. In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied. Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $428 million and $399 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The following tables show the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: Uncompensated care:       Amounts in millions     Three Months Ended        Nine Months Ended             September 30,                    September 30,                    September 30,                    September 30,                            2016        %           2015        %           2016        %           2015        %       Charity care     $  175           47  %     $  132           41  %     $  508           48  %     $  381           44  %    Uninsured discounts     195           53  %     190           59  %     547           52  %     491           56  %    Total uncompensated care     $  370           100  %     $  322           100  %     $  1,055           100  %     $  872           100  %     As reflected on the tables above in All Acute Care Hospitals, the provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals amounted to approximately $173 million and $185 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately $492 million and $459 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Estimated cost of providing uncompensated care: The estimated costs of providing uncompensated care as reflected below were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts. Amounts included in the provision for doubtful accounts, as mentioned above, are not included in the calculation of estimated costs of providing uncompensated care. The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities. 29  Estimated cost of providing uncompensated care             Three Months Ended        Nine Months Ended             September 30,        September 30,        September 30,        September 30,       Amounts in millions        2016           2015           2016           2015       Estimated cost of providing charity care     $  27        $  21        $  76        $  59       Estimated cost of providing uninsured discounts related care     30        30        81        76       Estimated cost of providing uncompensated care     $  57        $  51        $  157        $  135      Behavioral Health Services Our Same Facility basis results (which is a non-GAAP measure), which include the operating results for facilities and businesses operated in both the current year and prior year period, neutralize the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods. Our Same Facility basis results reflected on the tables below also exclude from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below Sources of Revenue-Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs. However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under All Behavioral Health Care Facilities. The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses. To obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance, the Same Facility results should be examined in connection with our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  The following table summarizes the results of operations for our behavioral health care facilities, on a same facility basis, and is used in the discussions below for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands): Same Facility—Behavioral Health             Three months ended September 30, 2016        Three months ended September 30, 2015        Nine months ended September 30, 2016        Nine months ended September 30, 2015             Amount        % of Net Revenues        Amount        % of Net Revenues        Amount        % of Net Revenues        Amount        % of Net Revenues       Net revenues before provision for doubtful accounts     $  1,126,438                    $  1,095,407                    $  3,377,412                    $  3,288,111                   Less: Provision for doubtful accounts        27,933                       26,227                       85,688                       84,371                   Net revenues        1,098,505           100.0  %        1,069,180           100.0  %        3,291,724           100.0  %        3,203,740           100.0  %    Operating charges:                                                                                                    Salaries, wages and benefits        550,675           50.1  %        518,862           48.5  %        1,622,515           49.3  %        1,542,166           48.1  %    Other operating expenses        214,542           19.5  %        209,578           19.6  %        628,943           19.1  %        617,354           19.3  %    Supplies expense        47,611           4.3  %        48,317           4.5  %        140,843           4.3  %        142,378           4.4  %    Depreciation and amortization        31,720           2.9  %        30,403           2.8  %        94,671           2.9  %        89,463           2.8  %    Lease and rental expense        10,091           0.9  %        11,445           1.1  %        29,686           0.9  %        31,058           1.0  %    Subtotal-operating expenses        854,639           77.8  %        818,605           76.6  %        2,516,658           76.5  %        2,422,419           75.6  %    Income from operations        243,866           22.2  %        250,575           23.4  %        775,066           23.5  %        781,321           24.4  %    Interest expense, net        429           0.0  %        478           0.0  %        1,327           0.0  %        1,418           0.0  %    Income before income taxes     $  243,437           22.2  %     $  250,097           23.4  %     $  773,739           23.5  %     $  779,903           24.3  %   Three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: On a same facility basis during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to the third quarter of 2015, net revenues generated from our behavioral health services increased 2.7% or $29 million to $1.10 billion from $1.07 billion. Income before income taxes decreased $7 million or 3% to $243 million or 22.2% of net revenues during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $250 million or 23.4% of net revenues during the comparable prior year quarter. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, net revenue per adjusted admission increased 1.2% and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 1.5%, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2015. On a same facility basis, inpatient admissions to our behavioral health facilities increased 1.7% and adjusted admissions increased 1.3% during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable quarter of 2015. Patient days and adjusted patient days increased 1.6% and 1.1%,  30  respectively, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities remained unchanged at 12.9 days during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 75% during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  In certain markets in which we operate, the ability of our behavioral health facilities to fully meet the demand for their services has been unfavorably impacted by a shortage of clinicians which includes psychiatrists, nurses and mental health technicians which has, at times, caused the closure of a portion of available bed capacity. As a result, we have instituted certain initiatives at the impacted facilities designed to enhance recruitment and retention of clinical staff. Although we believe the impact on these facilities is temporary, we can provide no assurance that these factors will not continue to unfavorably impact our patient volumes, to some degree, throughout the remainder of 2016.  Nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: On a same facility basis during the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the comparable period of 2015, net revenues generated from our behavioral health services increased 2.7% or $88 million to $3.29 billion from $3.20 billion. Income before income taxes decreased 1% or $6 million to $774 million or 23.5% of net revenues during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $780 million or 24.3% of net revenues during the comparable prior year period. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, net revenue per adjusted admission increased 1.9% and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 1.7%, as compared to the comparable period of 2015. On a same facility basis, inpatient admissions to our behavioral health facilities increased 1.1% and adjusted admissions increased 0.7% during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable period of 2015. Patient days and adjusted patient days increased 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities remained unchanged at 12.8 days during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 76% and 77% during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Income before income taxes decreased $4 million or 2% to $246 million or 21.3% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $250 million or 22.9% during the third quarter of 2015. The increase resulted from: (i) a $7 million decrease at our behavioral health care facilities on a same facility basis, as discussed above, and; (ii) other combined net increase of $2 million due primarily to the income before income taxes generated during the third quarter of 2016 at the facilities acquired in the Foundations transaction.  Nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the comparable prior year period, net revenues generated from our behavioral health services increased $217 million or 6.6% due to: (i) the above-mentioned $88 million or 2.7% increase in net revenues on a same facility basis, and; (ii) $129 million of other combined net increases consisting primarily of the revenues generated at the facilities acquired in the Alpha and Foundations transactions.  Income before income taxes increased $12 million or 2% to $784 million or 22.5% of net revenues during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to $772 million or 23.6% during the comparable period of 2015. The increase resulted primarily from the income before income taxes generated during the first nine months of 2016 at the facilities acquired in the Alpha and Foundations transactions.  Sources of Revenue Overview: We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients. Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control. The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis. We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues. Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year. Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts. The following table shows the approximate percentages of net patient revenue for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 presented on: (i) a combined basis for both our acute care and behavioral health facilities; (ii) for our acute care facilities only, and; (iii) for our behavioral health facilities only. Net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from established billing rates, which we derived from various sources of payment for the periods indicated. 32        Acute Care and Behavioral Health Facilities Combined     Percentage of Net Patient Revenues        Percentage of Net Patient Revenues             Three Months Ended        Nine Months Ended             September 30,        September 30,             2016        2015        2016        2015       Third Party Payors:                                                    Medicare        20  %        21  %        20  %        21  %    Medicaid        12  %        13  %        12  %        13  %    Managed Care (HMO and PPOs)        56  %        55  %        56  %        54  %    Other Sources        12  %        11  %        12  %        12  %    Total        100  %        100  %        100  %        100  %         Acute Care Facilities     Percentage of Net Patient Revenues        Percentage of Net Patient Revenues             Three Months Ended        Nine Months Ended             September 30,        September 30,             2016        2015        2016        2015       Third Party Payors:                                                    Medicare        25  %        25  %        25  %        26  %    Medicaid        7  %        8  %        7  %        7  %    Managed Care (HMO and PPOs)        64  %        65  %        64  %        63  %    Other Sources        4  %        2  %        4  %        4  %    Total        100  %        100  %        100  %        100  %         Behavioral Health Facilities     Percentage of Net Patient Revenues        Percentage of Net Patient Revenues             Three Months Ended        Nine Months Ended             September 30,        September 30,             2016        2015        2016        2015       Third Party Payors:                                                    Medicare        16  %        17  %        15  %        17  %    Medicaid        16  %        18  %        16  %        19  %    Managed Care (HMO and PPOs)        49  %        44  %        48  %        45  %    Other Sources        19  %        21  %        21  %        19  %    Total        100  %        100  %        100  %        100  %     Medicare: Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities. Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program. Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge. The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient’s Medicare severity diagnosis related group (“MS-DRG”). Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care. This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity. While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an “outlier” payment if a particular patient’s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold. MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the “hospital market basket index,” gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals. 33  In August, 2016, CMS published its IPPS 2017 final payment rule which provides for a 2.7% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, without consideration for the decreases related to the required Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (“DSH”) payment changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments would approximate 0.95%. Including the estimated decreases to our DSH payments (approximating -0.8%), we estimate our overall decrease from the final IPPS 2017 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017) will approximate -0.2%. This projected impact from the IPPS 2017 final rule includes both the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as discussed below. In July, 2015, CMS published its IPPS 2016 final payment rule which provides for a 2.4% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, without consideration for the decreases related to the required Medicare DSH payment changes and decrease to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments would approximate 1.1%. Including the estimated decreases to our Medicare DSH payments (approximating 1.6%), we estimate our overall decrease from the final IPPS 2016 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016) will approximate -0.1%. This projected impact from the IPPS 2016 final rule includes both the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as discussed below. In August, 2014, CMS published its IPPS 2015 payment rule which provides for a 2.9% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, without consideration for the decreases related to the required DSH payment changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments would approximate 0.6%. Including the estimated decreases to our DSH payments (–1.9%) and Medicare Outlier threshold (–0.6%), we estimate our overall decrease from the IPPS 2015 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015) will approximate (–1.9%), or approximately $13 million annually. This projected impact from the IPPS 2015 rule includes both the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below. In August, 2013, CMS published its final IPPS 2014 payment rule which expanded CMS’s policy under which it defines inpatient admissions to include the use of an objective time of care standard. Specifically, it would require Medicare’s external review contractors to presume that hospital inpatient admissions are reasonable and necessary when beneficiaries receive a physician order for admission and receive medically necessary services for at least two midnights (the “Two Midnight” rule). In October, 2015 as part of the 2016 Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”) final rule (additional related disclosure below), CMS will allow payment for one-midnight stays under the Medicare Part A benefit on a case-by case basis for rare and unusual exceptions based the presence of certain clinical factors. CMS also announced in the final rule that, effective October 1, 2015, Quality Improvement Organizations (“QIOs”) will conduct reviews of short inpatient stay reviews rather than Medicare Administrative Contractors . Additionally, CMS also announced that Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”) resumed patient status reviews for claims with admission dates of January 1, 2016 or later, and the agency indicates that RACs will conduct these reviews focused on providers with high denial rates that are referred by the QIOs. In its IPPS 2017 final payment rule, CMS: (i) reversed the Two-Midnight rule’s 0.2% reduction in hospital payments, and; (ii) implemented a temporary one-time increase of 0.8% in FFY2017 payments to offset cuts in the preceding fiscal years affected by the prior 0.2% reduction.  In August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) was enacted into law. Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, continued the 2% reductions to Medicare reimbursement imposed under the 2011 Act. For federal fiscal year 2015, the aggregate annual sequestration reduction to our Medicare net revenues was approximately $36 million with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. 34  On January 2, 2013 ATRA was enacted which, among other things, includes a requirement for CMS to recoup $11 billion from hospitals from Medicare IPPS rates during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2017. The recoupment relates to IPPS documentation and coding adjustments for the period 2008 to 2013 for which adjustments were not previously applied by CMS. Both the 2014 and 2015 IPPS final rules include a -0.8% recoupment adjustment. CMS has included the same 0.8% recoupment adjustment in fiscal year 2016 and has proposed to include a 1.5% recoupment adjustment in federal fiscal year 2017 in order to recover the entire $11 billion. This adjustment is reflected in the IPPS estimated impact amounts noted above. On April 16, 2015, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 was enacted and an anticipated 3.2% payment increase in 2018 is scheduled to be phased in at 0.5% per year over 6 years beginning in fiscal year 2018. Inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program are paid under a Psychiatric Prospective Payment System (“Psych PPS”). Medicare payments to psychiatric hospitals are based on a prospective per diem rate with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics. The Psych PPS also contains provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. In July, 2016, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2017. Under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 2.3% compared to federal fiscal year 2016. This amount includes the effect of the 2.8% market basket update less a 0.2% adjustment as required by the Affordable Care Act and a 0.3% productivity adjustment.  In July, 2015, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2016. Under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 1.7% compared to federal fiscal year 2015. This amount includes the effect of the 2.4% market basket update less a 0.2% adjustment as required by the Affordable Care Act and a 0.5% productivity adjustment. The final rule also updates the Inpatient Psychiatric Quality Reporting Program, which requires psychiatric facilities to report on quality measures or incur a reduction in their annual payment update. On July 31, 2014, CMS published it Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2015. Under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 2.1% compared to federal fiscal year 2014. This amount includes the effect of the 2.9% market basket update adjusted by the Affordable Care Act required 0.3% reduction and the -0.5% productivity adjustment. The final rule also updates the Inpatient Psychiatric Quality Reporting Program, which requires psychiatric facilities to report on quality measures or incur a reduction in their annual payment update. In November, 2016, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2017. The hospital market basket increase is 2.7%. The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.3% and 0.75% reduction to the 2017 OPPS market basket resulting in a 2017 OPPS market basket update at 1.65%. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2017 will aggregate to a net increase of 1.5% which includes a -1.3% decrease to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates. When the behavioral health division’s partial hospitalization rate impact is excluded, we estimate that our Medicare 2017 OPPS payments will result in a 2.1% increase in payment levels for our acute care division, as compared to 2016. In October, 2015, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2016. The hospital market basket increase is 2.8%. The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.2% reduction to the 2016 OPPS market basket. Additionally, CMS also proposes a reduction of 2.0%, which the CMS claims is necessary to eliminate $1 billion in excess laboratory payments that CMS packaged into OPPS payment rates in 2014 resulting in a 2016 OPPS market basket update at -0.3%. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2016 will aggregate to a net decrease of -0.2% which includes a 7.0% increase to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates. When the behavioral health division’s partial hospitalization rate impact is excluded, we estimate that our Medicare 2016 OPPS payments will result in a -1.6% decrease in payment levels for our acute care division, as compared to 2015. In October, 2014, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2015. The hospital market basket increase is 2.9%. The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.2% reduction to the 2015 OPPS market basket resulting in a 2015 OPPS market basket update at 2.2%. In the final rule, CMS will reduce the 2015 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs. When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS for 2015 will aggregate to a net increase of 0.2%. Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2015 is estimated to be 1.5%. Medicaid: Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally  35  significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities. We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $100 million annually from each of Texas, California, Washington, D.C., Nevada, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Massachusetts and Virginia, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. The Affordable Care Act substantially increases the federally and state-funded Medicaid insurance program, and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized non-Medicaid health plans for low-income residents not eligible for Medicaid starting in 2014. However, the Supreme Court has struck down portions of the Affordable Care Act requiring states to expand their Medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that states in which we operate will expand Medicaid coverage to individuals at 133% of the federal poverty level. Facilities in states not opting to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments, as discussed below. We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Texas and South Carolina Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: Hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a DSH adjustment. Congress established a national limit on DSH adjustments. Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the Medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse. Upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas’ and South Carolina’s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received additional reimbursement from each state’s DSH fund. The South Carolina and Texas DSH programs were renewed for each state’s 2017 DSH fiscal year (covering the period of October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017). During the second quarter of 2015, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (“THHSC”) finalized DSH payments for federal fiscal year 2014 which resulted in a $6 million annualized reduction in our Texas Medicaid DSH payments retroactive to October, 2013. In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of $11 million during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $29 million and $26 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. We expect reimbursements to our hospitals, pursuant to the 2017 fiscal year programs for Texas and South Carolina, to be at amounts similar to each state’s 2016 fiscal year amounts.   The Affordable Care Act and subsequent federal legislation provides for a significant reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2018 (see below in Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform-Medicaid Revisions for additional disclosure). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is to determine the amount of Medicaid DSH payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology. As Medicaid DSH payments to states will be cut, consequently, payments to Medicaid-participating providers, including our hospitals in Texas and South Carolina, will likely be reduced in the coming years. We are unable to estimate the impact of this federally required reduction at this time.   Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs:   We incur health-care related taxes (“Provider Taxes”) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items or services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services. Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state Medicaid programs. As outlined below, we derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments. Under the various state Medicaid supplemental payment programs including the impact of the below-mentioned Uncompensated Care and Upper Payment Limit programs, the Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive program and the Nevada state plan amendment, we earned revenues (before Provider Taxes) of approximately $80 million and $65 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $240 million and $228 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These revenues were offset by Provider Taxes of $42 million and $30 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $117 million and $97 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are recorded in other operating expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as  36  included herein. We estimate that our aggregate net revenues/benefit from the various state Medicaid supplemental payment programs (including Provider Tax programs) will approximate $176 million (net of Provider Taxes of $164 million) during the year ended December 31, 2016. The aggregate net benefit is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state’s portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements. However, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated future results of operations. Texas Uncompensated Care/Upper Payment Limit Payments: Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hidalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in Medicaid supplemental payment Section 1115 Waiver indigent care programs. Section 1115 Waiver Uncompensated Care (“UC”) payments replace the former Upper Payment Limit (“UPL”) payments. These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties. Our hospitals receive both supplemental payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals. The supplemental payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer (“IGT”) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals. However, the county or hospital district is prohibited from entering into an agreement to condition any IGT on the amount of any private hospital’s indigent care obligation. We recorded net revenues/benefit from UC and affiliated hospital indigent care revenues of $9 million and $14 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $36 million and $48 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts are net of Provider Taxes of $5 million and $2 million during the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $8 million and $5 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If the applicable hospital district or county makes IGTs consistent with 2015 levels, we believe we would be entitled to aggregate net revenues/benefit earned pursuant to these programs of approximately $47 million (net of Provider Taxes of $10 million) during the year ended December 31, 2016. On September 30, 2014, CMS notified the Texas Health and Human Services Commission that it was deferring the federal matching funds (approximately $75 million) on Texas Medicaid UC payments made to providers in certain counties. A deferral results in CMS withholding funds from the state representing the federal portion of Medicaid payments the state has previously made to providers. A deferral goes into effect when CMS questions the basis for all or part of the amount of Medicaid payments made to certain providers, and remains in place subject to CMS’s final determination. Our Texas hospitals are not located in the geographic areas impacted by this deferral. On January 7, 2015, CMS removed the aforementioned deferral but indicated they will continue their review and assessment of the underlying UC financing arrangements as to ensure their compliance with the applicable federal regulations and eligibility for federal matching dollars. In May, 2015, THHSC was informed by CMS that current private-hospital funding arrangements can continue for waiver-payment dates through August, 2017, without risk of disallowance of federal matching funds on the same grounds questioned in last year’s deferral. For state fiscal year 2016, Texas Medicaid operated under a CMS-approved Section 1115 five-year Medicaid waiver demonstration program. During the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal year 2012, the THHSC transitioned away from UPL payments to new waiver incentive payment programs, UC payments and Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments (“DSRIP”). During the first year of transition, which commenced on October 1, 2011, THHSC made payments to Medicaid UPL recipient providers that received payments during the state’s prior fiscal year. During demonstration years two through five (October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2016), THHSC continued to make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria are met by hospitals. Supplemental payments are also subject to aggregate statewide caps based on CMS approved Medicaid waiver amounts. In May, 2016, CMS approved a 15-month extension of the 1115 Waiver until December 31, 2017 at terms relatively consistent with current Waiver terms and conditions. The UC and DSRIP pools will continue to be funded at their current levels of $3.1 billion annually on a pro rata basis. Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments: In addition, the Texas Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver includes a DSRIP pool to incentivize hospitals and other providers to transform their service delivery practices to improve quality, health status, patient experience, coordination, and cost-effectiveness. DSRIP pool payments are incentive payments to hospitals and other providers that develop programs or strategies to enhance access to health care, increase the quality of care, the cost-effectiveness of care provided and the health of the patients and families served. In May, 2014, CMS formally approved specific DSRIP projects for certain of our hospitals for demonstration years 3 to 5 (our facilities did not materially participate in the DSRIP pool during demonstration years 1 or 2). DSRIP payments are contingent on the hospital meeting certain pre-determined milestones, metrics and clinical outcomes. Additionally, DSRIP payments are contingent on a governmental entity providing an IGT for the non-federal share component of the DSRIP payment. THHSC generally approves DSRIP reported metrics, milestones and clinical outcomes on a semi-annual basis in June and December. 37  Included in our financial results during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $10 million of net DSRIP revenues/benefit, all of which was earned during the first six months of each year. These amounts were net of provided taxes of $6 million during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Although we can provide no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for additional DSRIP revenues, subject to CMS’s approval and other conditions as outlined above, we estimate that we may be entitled to additional DSRIP revenues/benefit of approximately $27 million (net of Provider Taxes of $18 million) during the year ended December 31, 2016. Nevada SPA: In Nevada, CMS approved a state plan amendment (“SPA”) in August, 2014 that implemented a hospital supplemental payment program retroactive to January 1, 2014 and effective to September 30, 2015. In September, 2015, CMS also approved the successor supplemental payment program retroactive to July 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016. In connection with this program, our financial results included approximately $4 million and $3 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $9 million and $7 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We estimate that our reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $14 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. In April, 2016, CMS published its final Medicaid Managed Care Rule which explicitly permits but phases out the use of pass-through payments (including supplemental payments) by Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCO’s) to hospitals over ten years but allows for a transition of the pass-through payments into value-based payment structures, delivery system reform initiatives or payments tied to services under a MCO contract. The Company is unable to determine the financial impact of this aspect of the final rule. However, we can provide no assurance that the final rule will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. As outlined above, we receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental Medicaid payment programs. Failure to renew these programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary IGTs for the states’ share of the DSH programs, failure of our hospitals that currently receive supplemental Medicaid revenues to qualify for future funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. HITECH Act: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations implementing the health information technology (“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria. The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate have chosen to participate. Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful use” criteria. The government’s ultimate goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all Americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system. Pursuant to HITECH Act regulations, hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015. However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year. Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations. In connection with the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals, our consolidated results of operations include unfavorable pre-tax impacts, related primarily to depreciation and amortization expense, of approximately $9 million and $8 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $25 million and $23 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable “meaningful use” requirements. Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31 st , we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the “meaningful use” criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year. 38  Managed Care: A significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs. In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow. The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate. Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies. Commercial Insurance: Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance. Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital’s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy. Private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor. Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services. To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers’ reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals. Other Sources: Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage. Such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals’ indigent and charity care policy. Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances. Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform: Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations. In March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872, P.L. 111-152), (the “Reconciliation Act”) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), (the “Affordable Care Act”), were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below. Implemented Medicare Reductions and Reforms:                 •  The Reconciliation Act reduced the market basket update for inpatient and outpatient hospitals and inpatient behavioral health facilities by 0.25% in each of 2010 and 2011, by 0.10% in each of 2012 and 2013, 0.30% in 2014 and 0.20% in 2015.       •  The Affordable Care Act implemented certain reforms to Medicare Advantage payments, effective in 2011.       •  A Medicare shared savings program, effective in 2012.       •  A hospital readmissions reduction program, effective in 2012.       •  A value-based purchasing program for hospitals, effective in 2012.       •  A national pilot program on payment bundling, effective in 2013.       •  Reduction to Medicare disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) payments, effective in 2014, as discussed above.   Medicaid Revisions:              •  Expanded Medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments, effective in 2014.  39               •  The Affordable Care Act (as amended by subsequent federal legislation) requires annual aggregate reductions in federal DSH funding from federal fiscal year (“FFY”) 2018 through FFY 2025. The aggregate annual reduction amounts are $2.0 billion for FFY 2018, $3.0 billion for FFY 2019, $4.0 billion for FFY 2020, $5.0 billion for FFY 2021, $6.0 billion for FFY 2022, $7.0 billion for FFY 2023, and $8.0 billion for each of FFY 2024 and 2025.    Health Insurance Revisions:               •  Large employer insurance reforms, effective in 2015.       •  Individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies, effective in 2014.       •  Federally mandated insurance coverage reforms, effective in 2010 and forward.   The Affordable Care Act seeks to increase competition among private health insurers by providing for transparent federal and state insurance exchanges. The Affordable Care Act also prohibits private insurers from adjusting insurance premiums based on health status, gender, or other specified factors. We cannot provide assurance that these provisions will not adversely affect the ability of private insurers to pay for services provided to insured patients, or that these changes will not have a negative material impact on our results of operations going forward. Value-Based Purchasing: There is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events. Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing. The Affordable Care Act prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions (“HAC”). Beginning in FFY 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments. Additionally, hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard. The Affordable Care Act also required HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on October 1, 2012. The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1% in FFY 2013 and increasing by 0.25% each fiscal year up to 2% in FFY 2017 and subsequent years. HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS. HHS will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions. In its fiscal year 2016 IPPS final rule, CMS will fund the value-based purchasing program by reducing base operating DRG payment amounts to participating hospitals by 1.75%. For FFY 2017, this reduction will increase to 2%. Readmission Reduction Program: In the Affordable Care Act, Congress also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program (“HRRP”). The HRRP currently assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates for heart failure, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA), excluding planned readmissions, when compared to expected rates. In the fiscal year 2015 IPPS final rule, CMS added readmissions for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgical procedures beginning in fiscal year 2017. The impact of HRRP for federal fiscal year 2016 will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Accountable Care Organizations: The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations (“ACOs”). The ACO program allows providers (including hospitals), physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. The program is intended to produce savings as a  40  result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. In addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities. The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers’ rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments. Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required. Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations. Other Operating Results Interest Expense: As reflected on the schedule below, interest expense was $32 million and $27 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $92 million and $85 million during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively (amounts in thousands):             Three Months Ended September 30, 2016        Three Months Ended September 30, 2015        Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016        Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015       Revolving credit & demand notes     $  578        $  554        $  3,917        $  1,872       $400 million, 7.125% Senior Notes due 2016 (d.)        -           7,124           12,031           21,372       $300 million, 3.75% Senior Notes due 2019        2,812           2,813           8,437           8,438       $700 million, 4.75% Senior Notes due 2022, net (a.)        8,070           3,562           16,558           10,687       $400 million, 5.00% Senior Notes due 2026 (b.)        5,000           0           6,556           0       Term loan facility A (c.)        9,663           7,539           26,637           22,586       Accounts receivable securitization program (e.)        1,130           646           3,540           2,175       Subtotal-revolving credit, demand notes, Senior Notes,  term loan facilities and accounts receivable  securitization program        27,253           22,238           77,676           67,130       Interest rate swap expense, net        2,146           1,642           6,606           7,822       Amortization of financing fees        2,221           1,761           5,985           5,282       Other combined interest expense        1,246           1,549           3,811           4,728       Capitalized interest on major projects        (712  )        (55  )        (1,839  )        (96  )    Interest income        (25  )        (5  )        (68  )        (15  )    Interest expense, net     $  32,129        $  27,130        $  92,171        $  84,851               (a.)  On June 3, 2016, we completed the offering of an additional $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due in 2022 (issued at a yield of 4.35%), the terms of which are identical to the terms of our $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due in 2022 issued in August, 2014. These Senior Notes, combined, are referred to as $700 million, 4.75% Senior Notes due in 2022.         (b.)  On June 3, 2016, we completed the offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Senior Notes due in 2026.         (c.)  On June 7, 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment to our credit agreement dated November 15, 2010, as amended, to increase the size of the Term Loan A facility by $200 million to approximately $1.9 billion. Interest rates were not impacted by the fifth amendment to the credit agreement.        (d.)  The $400 million, 7.125% Senior Notes matured and were repaid in June, 2016 utilizing a portion of the funds generated from the debt issuances discussed in (a.), (b.) and (c.) above.         (e.)  In December, 2015, we amended our accounts receivable securitization program, which was scheduled to expire in October, 2016, to extend the term through December 21, 2018 and increase the borrowing limit to $400 million from $360 million. 41  Interest expense increased $5 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, and $7 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the comparable periods of 2015. The increases were due primarily to an increase in the aggregate average outstanding borrowings related to our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program.  Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates: The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands):             Three months ended        Nine month ended             September 30,        September 30,        September 30,        September 30,             2016        2015        2016        2015       Provision for income taxes     $  88,175        $  84,373        $  306,577        $  293,371       Income before income taxes        245,440           248,027           875,010           852,752       Effective tax rate        35.9  %        34.0  %        35.0  %        34.4  %     In May, 2016, we purchased third-party minority ownership interests in six acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Prior to that date, outside owners held various noncontrolling, minority ownership interests in seven of our acute care facilities (excluding a new acute care hospital located in Henderson, Nevada which was completed and opened in October, 2016) and one behavioral health care facility. Each of these facilities are owned and operated by limited liability companies (“LLC”) or limited partnerships (“LP”). As a result, since there is no income tax liability incurred at the LLC/LP level (since it passes through to the members/partners), the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests does not include any income tax provision/benefit. When computing the provision for income taxes, as reflected on our consolidated statements of income, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from income before income taxes since it represents the third-party members’/partners’ share of the income generated by the joint-venture entities. In addition to providing the effective tax rates, as indicated above (as calculated from dividing the provision for income taxes by the income before income taxes as reflected on the consolidated statements of income), we believe it is helpful to our investors that we also provide our effective tax rate as calculated after giving effect to the portion of our pre-tax income that is attributable to the third-party members/partners. The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income before income taxes, minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands):             Three months ended        Nine month ended             September 30,        September 30,        September 30,        September 30,             2016        2015        2016        2015       Provision for income taxes     $  88,175        $  84,373        $  306,577        $  293,371                                                            Income before income taxes        245,440           248,027           875,010           852,752       Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests        (5,400  )        (13,367  )        (40,232  )        (52,602  )    Income before income taxes and after net income                                                     attributable to noncontrolling interests        240,040           234,660           834,778           800,150       Effective tax rate        36.7  %        36.0  %        36.7  %        36.7  %   42  Liquidity Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.10 billion during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and $796 million during the comparable period of 2015. The net increase of $304 million was primarily attributable to the following:        •  a favorable change of $30 million due to an increase in net income plus/minus depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense and gain on sale of assets and businesses;        •  a $179 million favorable change in other working capital accounts due primarily to favorable changes in accrued compensation and accounts payable resulting from the timing of disbursements;        •  a $44 million favorable change in cash flows from forward exchange contracts related to our investment in foreign operations;        •  a $54 million favorable change in accounts receivable, and;        •  $3 million of other combined net unfavorable changes. Days sales outstanding (“DSO”): Our DSO are calculated by dividing our net revenue by the number of days in the nine-month periods. The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance at September 30th of each year to obtain the DSO. Our DSO were 49 days at September 30, 2016 and 54 days at September 30, 2015. Our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 include amounts due from Illinois of approximately $25 million and $28 million, respectively. Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures. Approximately $11 million as of September 30, 2016 and $12 million as of December 31, 2015, of the receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date. In addition, our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 includes approximately $7 million and $80 million, respectively, due from Texas in connection with Medicaid supplemental payment programs. The $7 million due from Texas as of September 30, 2016 related to uncompensated care program and disproportionate share hospital revenues. Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois and Texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements. However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois and/or Texas. Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from these states would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows. Net cash used in investing activities The $532 million of net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2016 consisted of: (i) $396 million spent on capital expenditures including capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities and the construction costs related to Henderson Hospital, a newly constructed 130-bed acute care facility that was completed and opened on October 31, 2016, and; (ii) $136 million spent related to the acquisition of businesses and property, including the acquisition cost of Desert View Hospital, a 25-bed facility located in Pahrump, Nevada and an office building located in Pennsylvania, both of which were acquired during the third quarter.    The $450 million of net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2015 consisted of: (i) $270 million spent on capital expenditures including capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities; (ii) $183 million spent related to the acquisition of businesses and property including the acquisition of a 46-bed behavioral health care facility located in the U.K. (acquired during the first quarter), the acquisition of Alpha Hospitals Holdings Limited consisting of four behavioral health care hospitals with 305 beds located in the U.K., and various other businesses, a management contract and real property assets, and; (iii) $3 million received related to the divestiture of a small operator of behavioral health care services (sold during the third quarter). Net cash used in financing activities During the first nine months of 2016, we used $564 million of net cash in financing activities as follows:        •  spent $815 million on net repayments of debt as follows: (i) $400 million related to the 7.125% senior secured notes that matured in June, 2016; (ii) $300 million related to our revolving credit facility; (iii) $75 million related to our accounts receivable securitization program; (iv) $33 million related to our term loan A facility, and; (v) $7 million related to other debt facilities;        •  generated $1.026 billion of proceeds related to new borrowings as follows: (i) $406 million received in connection with the issuance of additional 4.75% senior secured notes due in 2022; (ii) $400 million received from the issuance of 5.0% senior  43          secured notes due in 2026; (iii) $200 million of additional borrowings pursuant to our term loan A facility, and; (iv) $20 million of additional borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility;        •  spent $418 million to purchase third-party minority ownership interests in our six acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada;        •  spent $297 million to repurchase shares of our Class B Common Stock in connection with: (i) income tax withholding obligations related to stock-based compensation programs ($44 million), and; (ii) open market purchases pursuant to our $800 million stock repurchase program ($253 million);        •  spent $61 million to pay profit distributions related to noncontrolling interests in majority owned businesses;        •  generated $36 million of excess income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation;        •  spent $29 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $.10 per share;        •  spent $12 million on financing costs, and;        •  generated $6 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans. During the first nine months of 2015, we used $339 million of net cash in financing activities as follows:        •  spent $207 million on net repayments of debt as follows: (i) $140 million related to our revolving credit facility; (ii) $30 million related to our accounts receivable securitization program; (iii) $33 million related to our term loan A facility, and; (v) $4 million related to other debt facilities;        •  generated $16 million of proceeds from new borrowings pursuant to our short-term, on-demand credit facility;        •  spent $130 million to repurchase shares of our Class B Common Stock in connection with: (i) income tax withholding obligations related to stock-based compensation programs ($33 million), and; (ii) open market purchases pursuant to our $800 million stock repurchase program ($97 million);        •  spent $36 million to pay profit distributions related to noncontrolling interests in majority owned businesses;        •  generated $29 million of excess income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation;        •  spent $30 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $.10 per share;        •  generated $13 million from the sale/leaseback of two free-standing emergency departments, and;        •  generated $6 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans. Expected Capital Expenditures During the Remainder of 2016: During the remaining three months of 2016, we expect to spend approximately $120 million to $140 million on capital expenditures which includes expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals. We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and/or additional funds, as discussed below. Capital Resources Credit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities On June 7, 2016, we entered into a Fifth Amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to our credit agreement dated as of November 15, 2010, as amended on March 15, 2011, September 21, 2012, May 16, 2013 and August 7, 2014, among UHS, as borrower, the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time parties thereto, as lenders (“Credit Agreement”). The Fifth Amendment increased the size of the term loan A facility by $200 million and those proceeds were utilized to repay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement, as amended, which is scheduled to mature in August, 2019, consists of: (i) an $800 million revolving credit facility ($20 million of borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2016), and; (ii) a term loan A facility with $1.886 billion of borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2016. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either (1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to, at our election: the greatest of (a) the lender’s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month LIBOR rate plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings, or (2) the one, two, three or six month LIBOR rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to  44  2.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings. As of September 30, 2016, the applicable margins were 0.50% for ABR-based loans and 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit and term loan-A facilities. As of September 30, 2016, we had $20 million of borrowings outstanding pursuant to the terms of our $800 million revolving credit facility and we had $746 million of available borrowing capacity net of $34 million of outstanding letters of credit. The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain assets of the Company (which generally excludes asset classes such as substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals, certain real estate assets and assets held in joint-ventures with third-parties) and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, term loan-A quarterly installment payments of approximately $22 million are scheduled from the fourth quarter of 2016 through June, 2019. Previously, approximately $11 million of quarterly installment payments were made from the fourth quarter of 2014 through the third quarter of 2016.  Pursuant to the terms of our $400 million accounts receivable securitization program with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks (“Securitization”), which is scheduled to mature in December, 2018, substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals (“Receivables”) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings. We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings. We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us. The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities. The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks. The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans. At September 30, 2016, we had $325 million of outstanding borrowings and $75 million of additional borrowing capacity pursuant to the terms of the Securitization.  As of September 30, 2016, we had combined aggregate principal of $1.4 billion from the following senior secured notes:        •  $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior secured notes due in 2019 (“2019 Notes”) which were issued on August 7, 2014.           •  $700 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior secured notes due in 2022 (“2022 Notes”) which were issued as follows:        o  $300 million aggregate principal amount issued on August 7, 2014 at par.        o  $400 million aggregate principal amount issued on June 3, 2016 at 101.5% to yield 4.35%.          •  $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior secured notes due in 2026 (“2026 Notes”) which were issued on June 3, 2016. Interest is payable on the 2019 Notes and the 2022 Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year until the maturity date of August 1, 2019 for the 2019 Notes and August 1, 2022 for the 2022 Notes. Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 until the maturity date of June 1, 2026. The 2019 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2026 Notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The 2019 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2026 Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. In June, 2016, we repaid the $400 million, 7.125% senior secured notes which matured on June 30, 2016.  Our Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, dividends and stock repurchases; and requires compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as of September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the carrying value and fair value of our debt were approximately $3.6 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the carrying value and fair value of our debt were each approximately $3.5 billion. The fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions. We consider these to be “level 2” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with debt instruments. Our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 45% at each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 45  We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay dividends and potentially repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) the issuance of equity; (ii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility or through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement, and/or; (iii) the issuance of other long-term debt. We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity under our $800 million revolving credit facility and $400 million accounts receivable securitization program, as well as access to the capital markets, provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months. However, in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there have been no material changes in the off-balance sheet arrangements consisting of operating leases and standby letters of credit and surety bonds. Reference is made to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016 we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled $127 million consisting of: (i) $105 million related to our self-insurance programs, and; (ii) $22 million of other debt and public utility guarantees.  We have various obligations under operating leases or master leases for real property and under operating leases for equipment. The real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income. We sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received from these subleases are offset against the expense. In addition, we lease three acute care hospitals from Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the “Trust”) with terms scheduled to expire in 2021. These leases contain up to two, 5-year renewal options. We also lease two free-standing emergency departments and space in certain medical office buildings which are owned by the Trust.    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Reference is made to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.    Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of September 30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure obligations under the 1934 Act and the SEC rules thereunder. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the third quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.       PART II. OTHER INFORMATION     Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations, regulatory matters and litigation, as outlined below. Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) and Government Investigations: In February, 2013, the Office of Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) served a subpoena requesting various documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. (“UHS”) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and certain UHS owned behavioral health facilities including: Keys of Carolina,  46  Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health. Prior to receiving this subpoena: (i) the Keys of Carolina and Old Vineyard received notification during the second half of 2012 from the DOJ of its intent to proceed with an investigation following requests for documents for the period of January, 2007 to the date of the subpoenas from the North Carolina state Attorney General’s Office; (ii) Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center received a subpoena in December, 2012 from the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Virginia requesting various documents from July, 2006 to the date of the subpoena, and; (iii) The Meadows Psychiatric Center received a subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the date of the subpoena. Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property was sold in January, 2013. We were advised that a qui tam action had been filed against Roxbury Treatment Center but the government declined to intervene and the case was dismissed. In April, 2013, the OIG served facility specific subpoenas on Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting various documents from January, 2005 to the date of the subpoenas. In July, 2013, another subpoena was issued to Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting additional records. In October, 2013, we were advised by the DOJ’s Criminal Frauds Section that they received a referral from the DOJ Civil Division and opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center. Subsequent subpoenas have since been issued to River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center requesting additional documentation. In April, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) instituted a Medicare payment suspension at River Point Behavioral Health in accordance with federal regulations regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration subsequently issued a Medicaid payment suspension for the facility. River Point Behavioral Health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension. Notwithstanding, CMS continued the payment suspension. River Point Behavioral Health provided additional information to CMS in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the suspension remains in effect. In August, 2016, we received notification from CMS that effective August 30, 2016, the payment suspension will be continued for another 180 days. We cannot predict if and/or when the facility’s suspended payments will resume. Although the operating results of River Point Behavioral Health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2015, the payment suspension has had a material adverse effect on the facility’s results of operations and financial condition. In June, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena on Coastal Harbor Health System in Savannah, Georgia requesting documents from January, 2009 to the date of the subpoena. In February, 2014, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section had been expanded to include the National Deaf Academy. In March, 2014, a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) was served on the National Deaf Academy requesting documents and information from the facility from January 1, 2008 through the date of the CID. We have been advised by the government that the National Deaf Academy has been added to the facilities which are the subject of the coordinated investigation referenced above. In March, 2014, CIDs were served on Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Streamwood Behavioral Health requesting documents and information from those facilities from January, 2008 through the date of the CID. In September, 2014, the DOJ Civil Division advised us that they were expanding their investigation to include four additional facilities and were requesting production of documents from these facilities. These facilities are Arbour-HRI Hospital, Behavioral Hospital of Bellaire, St. Simons by the Sea, and Turning Point Care Center. In December, 2014, the DOJ Civil Division requested that Salt Lake Behavioral Health produce documents responsive to the original subpoenas issued in February, 2013. In March, 2015, the OIG issued subpoenas to Central Florida Behavioral Hospital and University Behavioral Center requesting certain documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena. In late March, 2015, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section had been expanded to include UHS as a corporate entity arising out of the coordinated investigation of the facilities described above and, in particular, Hartgrove Hospital. In December, 2015, we were notified by the DOJ Civil Division that the civil investigation also includes Arbour Hospital, Arbour-Fuller Hospital, Pembroke Hospital and Westwood Lodge located in Massachusetts. To date, these facilities have not received any requests for documentation or other information.  The DOJ has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated investigation referenced above is a False Claim Act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities. At present, we are uncertain as to potential liability and/or financial exposure of the Company and/or named facilities, if any, in connection with these matters. In December, 2015, we were advised that the DOJ opened an investigation involving the El Paso Behavioral Health System in El Paso, Texas. The DOJ is investigating potential Stark law violations relating to arrangements between the facility and physician(s) at  47  the facility. These agreements were entered into before we acquired the facility as a part of our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012. To our knowledge, this matter is not a part of the omnibus investigation referenced above. At present, we are uncertain as to potential liability and/or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.  In January, 2016, we were notified that the Department of Justice opened an investigation of the South Texas Health System of a potential False Claim Act case regarding compensation paid to cardiologists pursuant to employment agreements entered into in 2005. At present, we are uncertain as to potential liability and/or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter. Regulatory Matters: On July 23, 2015, Timberlawn Mental Health System (“Timberlawn”) received notification from CMS of its intent to terminate Timberlawn’s Medicare provider agreement effective August 7, 2015. This notification resulted from surveys conducted which alleged that Timberlawn was out of compliance with conditions of participation required for participation in the Medicare/Medicaid program. We filed a request for expedited administrative appeal with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Departmental Appeals Board, Civil Remedies Division, seeking review and reversal of the termination action. In conjunction with the administrative appeal, we filed litigation in the U.S District Court for the Northern District of Texas seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to have the termination stayed pending the conclusion of the administrative appeal. The trial court denied Timberlawn’s request for a temporary restraining order and dismissed the case. Timberlawn’s provider agreement was terminated effective August 14, 2015. In September, 2015 Timberlawn reached an agreement with CMS relative to its reapplication to the Medicare/Medicaid program. In exchange, Timberlawn agreed to dismiss its administrative appeal as well as not to pursue an appeal of the decision of the trial court. During this time, Timberlawn has remained open. In December, 2015, Timberlawn received notice from the Texas Department of State Health Services (“TDSHS”) of its intent to revoke Timberlawn’s license and impose an administrative penalty. We appealed and contested the proposed revocation and fine. We recently reached a settlement with TDSHS which resulted in their withdrawal of the intent to revoke Timberlawn’s license and a reduced administrative penalty. Also during the third quarter of 2016, Timberlawn successfully completed all requirements of the settlement agreement with CMS which included passing the second of two required inspections. As a result, Timberlawn has been reenrolled in the Medicare program effective September 21, 2016. Although the operating results of Timberlawn did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2015, the termination of Timberlawn’s provider agreement has had a material adverse effect on the facility’s results of operations and financial condition. Other Matters: In late September, 2015, many hospitals in Pennsylvania, including seven of our behavioral health care hospitals located in the state, received letters from the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (the “Department”) demanding repayment of allegedly excess Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments (“DSH”) for the federal fiscal year 2011 (“FFY2011”) amounting to approximately $4 million in the aggregate. In September, 2016, we received similar requests for repayment for alleged DSH overpayments for FFY2012. We filed administrative appeals for all of our facilities contesting the recoupment efforts for FFYs 2011 and 2012 as we believe the Department’s calculation methodology is inaccurate and conflicts with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. The Department has agreed to postpone the recoupment of the state’s share of the DSH payments until all hospital appeals are resolved but recently started recoupment of the federal share. If the Department is ultimately successful in its demand related to FFY2011 and FFY2012, it could take similar action with regards to FFY2013 and FFY2014. Due to a change in the Pennsylvania Medicaid State Plan and implementation of a CMS-approved Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver, we do not believe the methodology applied by the Department to FFY2011 and FFY2012 is applicable to reimbursements received for Medicaid services provided after January 1, 2015 by our behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania. We can provide no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our legal and administrative appeals related to the Department’s repayment demands. If our legal and administrative appeals are unsuccessful, our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by these repayments.  Matters Relating to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”): The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of PSI) which were in existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010. Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital: In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility. The requested documents were collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination. Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July, 2011 requesting additional documents, which have also been delivered to the DOJ. All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI’s ownership prior to our acquisition. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter. 48  Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital: In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility. Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010. The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ. All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI’s ownership prior to our acquisition. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter. General: We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry which subjects us to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations. These claims or suits include claims for damages for personal injuries, medical malpractice, commercial/contractual disputes, wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians’ staff privileges, and employment related claims, In addition, health care companies are subject to investigations and/or actions by various state and federal governmental agencies or those bringing claims on their behalf. Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations against healthcare providers concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes as well as compliance with clinical and operational regulations. Currently, and from time to time, we and some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries in the form of subpoenas, Civil Investigative Demands, audits and other document requests from various federal and state agencies. These inquiries can lead to notices and/or actions including repayment obligations from state and federal government agencies associated with potential non-compliance with laws and regulations. Further, the federal False Claim Act allows private individuals to bring lawsuits (qui tam actions) against healthcare providers that submit claims for payments to the government. Various states have also adopted similar statutes. When such a claim is filed, the government will investigate the matter and decide if they are going to intervene in the pending case. These qui tam lawsuits are placed under seal by the court to comply with the False Claims Act’s requirements. If the government chooses not to intervene, the private individual(s) can proceed independently on behalf of the government. Health care providers that are found to violate the False Claims Act may be subject to substantial monetary fines/penalties as well as face potential exclusion from participating in government health care programs or be required to comply with Corporate Integrity Agreements as a condition of a settlement of a False Claim Act matter. In September 2014, the Criminal Division of the DOJ, announced that all qui tam cases will be shared with their Division to determine if a parallel criminal investigation should be opened. The DOJ has also announced an intention to pursue civil and criminal actions against individuals within a company as well as the corporate entity or entities. In addition, health care facilities are subject to monitoring by state and federal surveyors to ensure compliance with program Conditions of Participation. In the event a facility is found to be out of compliance with a Condition of Participation and unable to remedy the alleged deficiency(s), the facility faces termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs or compliance with a System Improvement Agreement to remedy deficiencies and ensure compliance. The laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry are complex covering, among other things, government healthcare participation requirements, licensure, certification and accreditation, privacy of patient information, reimbursement for patient services as well as fraud and abuse compliance. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and expanding. Further, the Affordable Care Act has added additional obligations on healthcare providers to report and refund overpayments by government healthcare programs and authorizes the suspension of Medicare and Medicaid payments “pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud.” We monitor our business and have developed an ethics and compliance program with respect to these complex laws, rules and regulations. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with government regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with the sanctions referenced above which include fines, penalties and/or substantial damages, repayment obligations, payment suspensions, licensure revocation, and expulsion from government healthcare programs. Even if we were to ultimately prevail in any action brought against us or our facilities or in responding to any inquiry, such action or inquiry could have a material adverse effect on us. The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes. It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation. In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.   49  Item 1A. Risk Factors Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a listing of risk factors to be considered by investors in our securities. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
