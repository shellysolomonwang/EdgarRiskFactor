Item 1A Risk Factors and in Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors and in our Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2011 in Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors. Those factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any of our forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following:        •    our ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations, and/or changes in laws and government regulations;        •    an increasing number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level. No assurances can be given that the implementation of these new laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations;        •    possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government programs, including Medicare or Medicaid;        •    an increase in the number of uninsured and self-pay patients treated at our acute care facilities that unfavorably impacts our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our self-pay patient accounts;        •    our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same, including contracts with United/Sierra Healthcare in Las Vegas, Nevada;        •    the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us, including matters as disclosed in Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings;        •    the potential unfavorable impact on our business of deterioration in national, regional and local economic and business conditions, including a continuation or worsening of unfavorable credit market conditions;        •    competition from other healthcare providers (including physician owned facilities) in certain markets, including McAllen/Edinburg, Texas, the site of one of our largest acute care facilities and Riverside County, California;        •    technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;    27    Table of Contents     •    our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals;        •    demographic changes;        •    our acquisition of PSI: (i) has substantially increased our level of indebtedness which could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could potentially prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements related to our indebtedness, and; (ii) will require us to successfully integrate the operations of PSI with our operations and, even if such integration is accomplished, we may never realize the potential benefits of the acquisition;        •    our ability to successfully integrate and improve our recent acquisitions and the availability of suitable acquisitions and divestiture opportunities;        •    a significant portion of our revenues are produced by facilities located in Texas, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Washington, D.C., Nevada, Virginia, Massachusetts, Mississippi, California and Florida making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs (which have been proposed for the 2012 state fiscal years) as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those stated. Although the fiscal year 2012 state budgets for certain of the states in which we operate have not yet been finalized, we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid reimbursements are likely to be reduced by 3% to 4% (or approximately $45 million to $55 million annually) from the rates in effect during the first half of 2011.        •    our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund the future growth of our business;        •    some of our acute care facilities continue to experience decreasing inpatient admission trends;        •    our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;        •    the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations in July, 2010 implementing the health information technology (“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments starts in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful use criteria”. Our acute care facilities are scheduled to implement an EHR application, on a facility-by-facility basis, beginning in 2011 and ending in 2014, however, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for these incentive payments and, should we qualify, we are unable to quantify the amount of incentive payments we may receive since the amounts is dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each facility. Should we qualify for incentive payments, there may be timing differences in the recognition of the revenues and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the EHR application which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of operations. Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. Although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the HITECH Act;        •    in August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) was enacted into law. Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law would establish a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which would be responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. If the Joint Committee is unable to reach an agreement, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending could be automatically implemented which could result in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2%. We cannot predict if reductions to future Medicare or other government payments to providers will be implemented as a result of the 2011 Act or what impact, if any, the 2011 Act may have on our future results of operations;        •    the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance on current terms;        •    changes in our business strategies or development plans;        •    fluctuations in the value of our common stock, and;        •    other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Southwest Healthcare System: During the third quarter of 2009, Southwest Healthcare System (“SWHCS”), which operates Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center in Riverside County, California, entered into an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The agreement required SWHCS to engage an independent quality monitor to assist SWHCS in meeting all CMS’ conditions of participation. Further, the agreement provided that, during the last 60 days of the agreement, CMS would conduct a full Medicare certification survey. That survey took place the week of January 11, 2010.  In April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from CMS that it intended to effectuate the termination of SWHCS’s Medicare provider agreement effective June 1, 2010. In May, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CMS which abated the termination action scheduled for June 1, 2010. The agreement is one year in duration and required SWHCS to engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for SWHCS to meet the Medicare conditions of participation. At the conclusion of the agreement, CMS will conduct a full certification survey to determine if SWHCS has achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation. During the term of the agreement, SWHCS remains eligible to receive reimbursements from Medicare for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries. The certification survey commenced during the last week of July, 2011. We have not yet been notified as to the results of the survey and we are not aware of when notification will be made to us.  Also in April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from the California Department of Public Health (“CDPH”) indicating that it planned to initiate a process to revoke SWHCS’s hospital license. In May, 2010, SWHCS received the formal document related to the    28    Table of Contents  revocation action. In September, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CDPH relating to the license revocation. The terms of the CDPH agreement are substantially similar to those contained in the agreement with CMS. As a result of the agreement, SWHCS’s hospital license remains in effect pending the outcome of the CMS full certification survey which will occur at the end of the agreement. Pursuant to the results of the CMS full certification survey, should SWHCS be deemed to have achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, CDPH shall deem SWHCS’s license to be in good standing. Failure of SWHCS to achieve substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, pursuant to CMS’s full certification survey, will likely have a material adverse impact on SWHCS’s ability to continue to operate the facilities.  As a result of the matters discussed above, we were not previously permitted to open newly constructed capacity at Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center. However, in February, 2011, we received permission from CDPH to begin accessing the new capacity which has occurred. Unrelated to these developments, a competitor has recently opened a newly constructed acute care hospital. We are unable to predict the net impact of these developments on SWHCS’s results of operations in 2011 and beyond.  Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center remain fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their patients and the communities they serve. We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with both CMS and CDPH in an effort to resolve these matters, although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. Failure to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on us. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2010, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, SWHCS had a pre-tax (deficit)/income of approximately (0.9%) and 1.1%, respectively, of our income from operations after income attributable to noncontrolling interest.  Given these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. We assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  Revenue recognition: We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided. Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 37% of our net patient revenues during each of the three-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 and 38% of our net patient revenues during each of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs, accounted for 42% and 45% of our net patient revenues during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 42% and 46% of our net patient revenues during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Provision for Doubtful Accounts: On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience. Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $267 million at June 30, 2011 and $249 million at December 31, 2010.  Patients who express an inability to pay are reviewed for write-off as potential charity care. Our accounts receivable are recorded net of established charity care reserves of $158 million at June 30, 2011 and $99 million as of December 31, 2010.  Recent Accounting Standards: For a summary of accounting standards, please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as included herein.    29    Table of Contents Results of Operations  Three-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010:  The following table summarizes our results of operations and is used in the discussion below for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):                            Three months endedJune 30, 2011     Three months endedJune 30, 2010        Amount     % ofRevenues     Amount     % ofRevenues     Net revenues   $ 1,902,234       100.0 %    $ 1,338,315       100.0 %    Operating charges:                       Salaries, wages and benefits     852,078       44.8 %      563,552       42.1 %    Other operating expenses     354,835       18.7 %      249,114       18.6 %    Supplies expense     205,594       10.8 %      179,926       13.4 %    Provision for doubtful accounts     160,917       8.5 %      143,764       10.7 %    Depreciation and amortization     73,234       3.8 %      54,025       4.0 %    Lease and rental expense     23,339       1.2 %      18,185       1.4 %                                              Subtotal operating expenses     1,669,997       87.8 %      1,208,566       90.3 %                                              Income from operations     232,237       12.2 %      129,749       9.7 %    Interest expense, net     49,808       2.6 %      12,277       0.9 %                                              Income before income taxes     182,429       9.6 %      117,472       8.8 %    Provision for income taxes     66,395       3.5 %      41,057       3.1 %                                              Net income     116,034       6.1 %      76,415       5.7 %    Less: Income attributable to noncontrolling interests     12,385       0.7 %      10,843       0.8 %                                              Net income attributable to UHS   $ 103,649       5.4 %    $ 65,572       4.9 %                                             Net revenues increased 42% or $564 million to $1.90 billion during the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 as compared to $1.34 billion during the comparable quarter of the prior year. The increase was attributable to:        •    an $81 million or 6% increase in net revenues generated at our acute care hospitals and behavioral health care facilities owned during both periods (which we refer to as “same facility”);        •    $487 million of revenues generated at the facilities acquired by us from Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”) in November, 2010, and;        •    $4 million of other combined net decreases in revenues.  Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $65 million to $182 million during the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 as compared to $117 million during the comparable quarter of the prior year. Included in our income before income taxes during the second quarter of 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, was the following:        •    an increase of $11 million at our acute care facilities as discussed below in Acute Care Hospital Services (excluding the favorable impact during the second quarter of 2010 from the reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves, as discussed below);        •    an increase of $101 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in Behavioral Health Services (excluding the favorable impact during the second quarter of 2010 from the reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves, as discussed below);        •    a decrease of $38 million due to an increase in interest expense resulting primarily from the cost of borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition of PSI in November, 2010;        •    a decrease of $16 million resulting from the favorable adjustment recorded during the second quarter of 2010 to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves relating to prior years (please see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as included herein);        •    an increase of $18 million resulting from the transaction fees incurred during the second quarter of 2010 in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, and;        •    $11 million of other combined net decreases including the corporate overhead expenses incurred in connection with the behavioral health care facilities acquired from PSI.  Net income attributable to UHS increased $38 million to $104 million during the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 as compared to $66 million during the comparable prior year quarter. The increase during the second quarter of 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, consisted of:        •    an increase of $65 million in income from operations before income taxes, as discussed above;    30    Table of Contents     •    a decrease of $2 million resulting from an increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and;        •    a decrease of $25 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from a net increase in pre-tax income of $63 million ($65 million increase in income before income taxes net of the $2 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests).  Six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010:  The following table summarizes our results of operations and is used in the discussion below for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):                            Six months endedJune 30, 2011     Six months endedJune 30, 2010        Amount     % ofRevenues     Amount     % ofRevenues     Net revenues   $ 3,812,762       100.0 %    $ 2,685,468       100.0 %    Operating charges:                       Salaries, wages and benefits     1,697,942       44.5 %      1,142,478       42.5 %    Other operating expenses     704,281       18.5 %      496,142       18.5 %    Supplies expense     412,764       10.8 %      363,742       13.5 %    Provision for doubtful accounts     314,033       8.2 %      269,154       10.0 %    Depreciation and amortization     144,585       3.8 %      107,536       4.0 %    Lease and rental expense     46,507       1.2 %      36,119       1.3 %                                              Subtotal operating expenses     3,320,112       87.1 %      2,415,171       89.9 %                                              Income from operations     492,650       12.9 %      270,297       10.1 %    Interest expense, net     106,225       2.8 %      24,654       1.0 %                                              Income before income taxes     386,425       10.1 %      245,643       9.1 %    Provision for income taxes     140,404       3.6 %      86,466       3.2 %                                              Net income     246,021       6.5 %      159,177       5.9 %    Less: Income attributable to noncontrolling interests     28,179       0.8 %      21,786       0.8 %                                              Net income attributable to UHS   $ 217,842       5.7 %    $ 137,391       5.1 %                                             Net revenues increased 42% or $1.13 billion to $3.81 billion during the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 as compared to $2.69 billion during the comparable quarter of the prior year. The increase was attributable to:        •    a $168 million or 6% increase in net revenues generated at our acute care hospitals and behavioral health care facilities owned during both periods (which we refer to as “same facility”);        •    $967 million of revenues generated at the facilities acquired by us from PSI, and;        •    $8 million of other combined net decreases in revenues.  Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $141 million to $386 million during the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 as compared to $246 million during the comparable quarter of the prior year. Included in our income before income taxes during the first six months of 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year period, was the following:        •    an increase of $36 million at our acute care facilities as discussed below in Acute Care Hospital Services (excluding the favorable impact during the second quarter of 2010 from the reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves, as discussed below);        •    an increase of $210 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in Behavioral Health Services (excluding the favorable impact during the second quarter of 2010 from the reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves, as discussed below);        •    a decrease of $82 million due to an increase in interest expense resulting primarily from the cost of borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition of PSI in November, 2010;        •    a decrease of $16 million resulting from the favorable adjustment recorded during the second quarter of 2010 to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves relating to prior years (please see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as included herein);        •    an increase of $18 million resulting from the transaction fees incurred during the second quarter of 2010 in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, and;        •    $25 million of other combined net decreases including the corporate overhead expenses incurred in connection with the behavioral health care facilities acquired from PSI.    31    Table of Contents Net income attributable to UHS increased $80 million to $218 million during the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 as compared to $137 million during the comparable prior year period. The increase during the first six months of 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year period, consisted of:        •    an increase of $141 million in income from operations before income taxes, as discussed above;        •    a decrease of $6 million resulting from an increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and;        •    a decrease of $54 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from a net increase in pre-tax income of $135 million ($141 million increase in income before income taxes net of the $6 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests).  Acute Care Hospital Services  Same Facility and All Acute Care Basis  We believe that providing our results on a “Same Facility” basis, which includes the operating results for facilities owned in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance. Our “Same Facility” results also neutralize the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods.  As mentioned above, our results for the three and six-month period ended June 30, 2010 were favorably impacted by a $16 million reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves relating to prior years (recorded during the second quarter of 2010). Although approximately $15 million of the favorable impact recorded during the second quarter of 2010 applies to our acute care facilities, the favorable impact is not reflected in the acute care results for the 2010 periods presented as shown on the table below. There were no such adjustments applicable to the 2011 periods presented. After adjusting the below-reflected acute care results for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to minority interests) amounted to $94.7 million during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and $196.6 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2010. There were no other differences between “Same Facility” and “All Acute Care Basis” during the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 as there were no acute care hospitals acquired during the period of January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011.  The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities, on a same facility and all acute care basis, and is used in the discussion below for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):                                            Three Months EndedJune 30,     Six Months EndedJune 30,        2011     %     2010     %     2011     %     2010     %     Net revenues   $ 1,033,024       100.0     $ 974,010       100.0     $ 2,087,317       100.0     $ 1,963,321       100.0     Salaries, wages and benefits     389,918       37.7       366,558       37.6       781,878       37.5       741,657       37.7     Other operating expenses     186,817       18.1       173,363       17.8       366,388       17.6       346,560       17.7     Supplies expense     158,853       15.4       160,038       16.4       320,555       15.4       324,162       16.5     Provision for doubtful accounts     142,263       13.8       135,455       13.9       274,014       13.1       252,637       12.9     Depreciation and amortization     49,480       4.8       44,085       4.5       97,264       4.7       87,563       4.5     Lease and rental     13,565       1.3       13,625       1.4       27,100       1.3       27,118       1.4                                                                                       Subtotal operating expenses     940,896       91.1       893,124       91.7       1,867,199       89.5       1,779,697       90.6                                                                                       Income from operations     92,128       8.9       80,886       8.3       220,118       10.5       183,624       9.4     Interest expense, net     983       0.1       748       0.1       1,989       0.0       1,582       0.1                                                                                       Income before income taxes   $ 91,145       8.8     $ 80,138       8.2     $ 218,129       10.5     $ 182,042       9.3                                                                                      Three-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010:  During the three-month period ended June 30, 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $59 million or 6%. Income before income taxes (and before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $11 million or 14% to $91 million or 8.8% of net revenues during the second quarter of 2011 as compared to $80 million or 8.2% of net revenues during the comparable prior year quarter. The increase in income from operations at our acute care hospitals during the three month period ended June 30, 2011, as compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year, was due primarily to: (i) a favorable change in payor mix and acuity of patients treated at our hospitals; (ii) a stabilization of our uninsured patient volumes, and; (iii) a reduction in our supplies expense.    32    Table of Contents During the three-month period ended June 30, 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, inpatient admissions to our acute care facilities decreased 2.5% and adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) decreased 0.9%. Patient days at these facilities remained unchanged and adjusted patient days increased 1.6% during the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.4 days and 4.3 days during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 58% during each of the three-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2011, net revenue per adjusted admission increased 7.1% and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 4.4%, as compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year.  Six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010:  During the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year period, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $124 million or 6%. Income before income taxes (and before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $36 million or 20% to $218 million or 10.5% of net revenues during the first six months of 2011 as compared to $182 million or 9.3% of net revenues during the comparable prior year period. The increase in income from operations at our acute care hospitals during the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, as compared to the comparable period of the prior year, was due primarily to the operating factors mentioned above (a favorable change in payor mix and acuity of patients treated at our hospitals, a stabilization of our uninsured patient volumes and a reduction in our supplies expense).  During the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year period, inpatient admissions to our acute care facilities decreased 1.7% and adjusted admissions decreased 0.2%. Patient days at these facilities increased 0.3% and adjusted patient days increased 1.9% during the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.5 days and 4.4 days during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 61% during each of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, net revenue per adjusted admission increased 6.5% and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 4.4%, as compared to the comparable period of the prior year.  Charity care and uninsured discounts:  A significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles. We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net. Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, amounting to $239 million and $190 million during three-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $462 million and $366 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The estimated costs of providing the charity services was $43 million and $38 million during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $82 million and $73 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The estimated costs were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned gross charity care and uninsured discount amounts. The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities (excluding provision for doubtful accounts) divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities. An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.

The increase was attributable to the $487 million of net revenues generated at the facilities acquired from PSI in November, 2010 and a $22 million increase in net revenues on a same facility basis, as discussed above. Income before income taxes increased $102 million or 118% to $190 million or 22.0% of net revenues during the second quarter of 2011, as compared to $87 million or 24.4% of net revenues during the second quarter of 2010. The increase was attributable to the income before income taxes generated at the facilities acquired from PSI, slightly offset by other unfavorable changes including the recording of certain legal reserves during the second quarter of 2011 and the favorable impact of approximately $2 million recorded during the second quarter of 2010 resulting from the above-mentioned reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves.  During the first six months of 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year period, net revenues at our behavioral health care facilities (including the PSI facilities), increased 143% or $1.01 billion. The increase was attributable to the $968 million of net revenues generated at the facilities acquired from PSI in November, 2010 and a $44 million increase in net revenues on a same facility basis, as discussed above. Income before income taxes increased $211 million or 129% to $375 million or 21.9% of net revenues during the first six months of 2011, as compared to $164 million or 23.2% of net revenues during the comparable 2010 period. The increase was attributable to the income before income taxes generated at the facilities acquired from PSI, slightly offset by other unfavorable changes as mentioned above.  Sources of Revenue  Overview: We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.

All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities. Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.  Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge. The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient’s Medicare severity diagnosis related group (“MS-DRG”). Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care. This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity. While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an “outlier” payment if a particular patient’s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold.  MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the “hospital market basket index,” gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.  In July, 2009, CMS published the final IPPS 2010 payment rule which provided for a 2.1% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments were considered, our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2010 rule was approximately 1.1%.  In July, 2010, CMS published its final IPPS 2011 payment rule which provided for a 2.6% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall decrease from the proposed federal fiscal year 2011 rule will approximate 1.1%. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.25% in federal fiscal year 2011.  In August, 2011, CMS published its final IPPS 2012 payment rule which provided for a 3.0% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform productivity adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2012 rule will approximate 0.6%. CMS also includes a 2.0% market basket reduction related to prior year documentation and coding adjustment as well as a 1.1% increase related to the correction of a prior year wage index budget neutrality adjustment. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS was also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.10% in federal fiscal year 2012. The projected impact from this IPPS rule noted above reflects all of the adjustments described in this paragraph.  In September, 2007, the “TMA, Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of 2007” legislation took effect and scaled back cuts in hospital reimbursement that CMS was set to impose. In federal fiscal years 2010 to 2012, the new law requires CMS to    36    Table of Contents  make adjustments to the Medicare standardized amounts in these years to reflect the removal of actual aggregate payment increases or decreases for documentation and coding adjustments that occurred during federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 as compared to the initial CMS estimates. In federal fiscal year 2010, CMS made its initial statutory mandated adjustment under this legislation and will continue to do so in subsequent fiscal years to ensure the implementation of MS-DRGs was budget neutral among all affected hospitals. In July, 2010, the IPPS 2011 final payment rule applied a 2.9% reduction to the 2011 market basket update and indicated another 2.9% reduction would also be applied in 2012 for documenting and coding. In this same rule, CMS indicated a remaining documenting and coding adjustment of 3.9% reduction is still required to be made to future IPPS updates. In the 2012 IPPS final rule, CMS offset 2.0% of this remaining reduction and indicated that the remaining 1.9% may be offset in the IPPS 2013 payment rule.  On January 1, 2005, CMS implemented a new Psychiatric Prospective Payment System (“Psych PPS”) for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program. This system replaced the cost-based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem Psych PPS with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics. The Psych PPS also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. According to the May, 2009 CMS notice, the market basket increase was 2.1% for the period of July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010. According to the April, 2010 CMS notice, the market basket increase was 2.4% for the period of July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011. In January, 2011 CMS published its proposed Psych PPS rule for the fifteen month period July 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012. The market basket increase for this time period is scheduled to be 2.75%, which includes a 0.25% reduction required by the federal Health Care Reform legislation enacted in 2010.  In October 2009, CMS published its annual final Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”) rule for 2010. The final market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.1%. When other statutorily required adjustments are considered the overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2010 is estimated to be 1.9%.  In November 2010, CMS published its annual final Medicare OPPS rule for 2011. The final market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.46%. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.25% in federal fiscal year 2011. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, the overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2011 is estimated to be 3.2%.  In July, 2011, CMS published its annual proposed Medicare OPPS rule for 2012. The proposed market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.8%. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.1% in federal fiscal year 2012 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity adjustment which is proposed to be 1.2%. In the proposed rule, CMS is also recommending a significant decrease in 2012 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center (CMHC) partial hospitalization programs. When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS payment decrease for 2012 is estimated to be 2.0%. Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2012 is estimated to be 1.3%.  In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations implementing the health information technology (“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria.  The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments starts in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary and we are unable to predict which states will ultimately choose to participate. Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful use criteria”. These Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments are intended to offset a portion of the cost incurred to qualify as a meaningful user of EHR. Our acute care facilities have begun implementing an EHR application, on a facility-by-facility basis, beginning in 2011. The implementation is scheduled to be completed in 2013. However, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for these incentive payments and, should we qualify, the amount of incentive payments received is dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each facility. Should we qualify for incentive payments, there may be timing differences in the recognition of the revenues and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the EHR application which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of operations. Approximately $15 million of these incentive payments, which relate to state Medicaid programs, could be received during the second half of 2011. Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. Although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the HITECH Act.  In August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) was enacted into law. Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law would establish a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which would be responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. If the Joint Committee is unable to reach an agreement, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending could be automatically implemented which could result in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2%. We cannot predict if reductions to future Medicare or other government payments to providers will be implemented as a result of the 2011 Act or what impact, if any, the 2011 Act may have on our future results of operations.  Medicaid: Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid. All of our acute care    37    Table of Contents  hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.  We receive a large concentration of our Medicaid revenues from Texas and significant amounts from Pennsylvania, Illinois, Washington, D.C., Nevada, Virginia, Massachusetts, Mississippi, California and Florida. The majority of these states, as well as most other states in which we operate, have reported significant budget deficits that have resulted in the reduction of Medicaid funding for 2010 and 2011. Furthermore, many states are currently working to effectuate further significant reductions in the level of Medicaid funding due to significant state budget deficits projected for 2012, which could adversely affect future levels of Medicaid reimbursement received by our hospitals. Although the fiscal year 2012 state budgets for certain of the states in which we operate have not yet been finalized, we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid reimbursements are likely to be reduced by 3% to 4% (or approximately $45 million to $55 million annually) from the rates in effect during the first half of 2011.  Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hildalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in CMS-approved private Medicaid supplemental payment (“UPL”) programs. These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties. Our hospitals receive both UPL payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals. The UPL payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer (“IGT”) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals. We received $8 million and $10 million during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $18 million and $20 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of net aggregate UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care payments. If during 2011 the hospital district makes IGTs consistent with 2010, we believe we would be entitled to aggregate net UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care payment revenues of approximately $15 million during the remaining six months of 2011.  In July, 2011 in accordance with the state 2012-2013 General Appropriations Act (“the Act”), the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (“THHSC”) published a proposed rule that changes the reimbursement methodology for inpatient services by establishing a statewide base standard dollar amount (“SDA”) rate along with certain hospital specific SDA rate adjustments for geographic location, trauma level designation and teaching hospital status. The new SDA payment methodology is scheduled to become effective September 1, 2011. Similarly, THHSC also proposed changes in conformance with the Act which results in reductions to various categories of Medicaid hospital outpatient services. The expected reduction to our annual Medicaid inpatient reimbursement resulting from the proposed inpatient SDA payment methodology has been factored into the fiscal year 2012 Medicaid reductions (3% to 4%), as mentioned above.  The THHSC has indicated an intention to expand state Medicaid managed care programs in future state fiscal years starting in the state’s 2012 fiscal year. Although we are unable to determine the impact of the managed care expansion on future Medicaid reimbursement or its impact on Medicaid UPL payments, depending on the actual structure of the actual managed care expansion, this change could have a material adverse impact on our Medicaid UPL payments.  Managed Care: A significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs. In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow. The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate. Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.  Commercial Insurance: Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance. Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital’s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy. Private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.  Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services. To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers’ reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.    38    Table of Contents Other Sources: Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage. Such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals’ indigent and charity care policy. Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.  State Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: Hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) adjustment. Congress established a national limit on DSH adjustments. Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the Medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse.  Upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas’ and South Carolina’s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received additional reimbursement from each state’s DSH fund. The Texas and South Carolina programs have been renewed for each state’s 2011 fiscal years (covering the period of October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011 for each state). In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of $11 million and $13 million during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $23 million and $27 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Failure to renew these DSH programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of our hospitals that currently receive DSH payments to qualify for future DSH funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Assuming that the Texas and South Carolina programs are renewed for each state’s 2012 fiscal years at amounts similar to the 2011 fiscal year amounts, we estimate our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs to be $24 million during the remaining six months of 2011.  Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform: Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, the War on Terrorism, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, the expansion of a Medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.  In March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872, P.L. 111-152), (the “Reconciliation Act”) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), (the “Affordable Care Act”), were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below.  Immediate Medicare Reductions:  The Reconciliation Act reduced the market basket update for inpatient and outpatient hospitals and inpatient behavioral health facilities by 0.25% in each of 2010 and 2011 and by 0.10% in 2012. Further, the Affordable Care Act implements certain reforms to Medicare Advantage payments, effective in 2011.  Future Medicare Reductions:  Future changes to the Medicare program include:        •    A Medicare shared savings program (effective 2012)        •    A hospital readmissions reduction program (effective 2012)        •    A national pilot program on payment bundling (effective 2013)        •    A value-based purchasing program for hospitals (effective 2012)        •    Reduction to Medicare disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) payments (effective 2014)  Medicaid Revisions:        •    Expanded Medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments (effective 2014)        •    Reduction to Medicaid DSH (effective 2014)  Health Insurance Revisions:        •    Large employer insurance reforms (effective 2014)        •    Individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies (effective 2014)        •    Federally mandated insurance coverage reforms (2010 and forward)    39    Table of Contents Although we do not believe the above-mentioned Medicare market basket reductions implemented in 2010 will have a material impact on our results of operations, we are unable to estimate the future impact of the other legislative changes as outlined above.  In addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities. The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers’ rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments. Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.  Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.  Other Operating Results  The combined net revenues and income before income taxes generated at our surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers was not material to our results of operations during each of the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.  Interest Expense:  Pursuant to the table below, interest expense was $50 million and $12 million during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $106 million and $25 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, (amounts in thousands):                            Three MonthsEndedJune 30,2011     Three MonthsEndedJune 30,2010     Six MonthsEndedJune 30,2011     Six MonthsEndedJune 30,2010     Revolving credit & demand notes   $ 1,868     $ 614     $ 4,037     $ 1,364     $200 million, 6.75% Senior Notes due 2011     3,377       3,378       6,755       6,756     $400 million, 7.125% Senior Notes due 2016     7,124       7,124       14,248       14,248     $250 million, 7.00% Senior Notes due 2018     4,375       —        8,750       —      Term loan facility A     6,724       —        15,480       —      Term loan facility B     14,873       —        35,244       —      Accounts receivable securitization program     676       191       1,341       343                                               Subtotal-revolving credit, demand notes, Senior Notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program     39,017       11,307       85,855       22,711     Interest rate swap expense, net     2,198       1,562       3,603       3,119     Other combined interest expense, including amortization of financing fees     8,686       1,372       16,904       2,467     Capitalized interest on major construction projects     (51 )      (1,911 )      (51 )      (3,373 )    Interest income     (42 )      (53 )      (86 )      (270 )                                              Interest expense, net   $ 49,808     $ 12,277     $ 106,225     $ 24,654                                              Interest expense increased $38 million and $82 million during the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods of 2010. The increased interest expense was due primarily to: (i) the increased borrowings used to finance our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010; (ii) an increase in the average effective interest rate, as discussed below, and; (iii) the interest expense incurred during the second quarter of 2011 on the $250 million, 7.00% senior notes issued in September, 2010. The average outstanding borrowings under our $3.30 billion credit agreement (consisting of an $800 million revolving credit facility, a $1.04 billion Term Loan A and a $1.46 billion Term Loan B), accounts receivable securitization program and previously outstanding credit agreement was $2.94 billion and $2.97 billion during the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, respectively, as compared to $254 million and $289 million during the three and six-month periods of 2010, respectively. The effective interest rate on these facilities, including the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense, was 4.5% and 4.9% during the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, respectively, and 4.0% and 3.6% during the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, respectively.  Discontinued Operations  In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI facilities, one of which is located in Delaware (MeadowWood    40    Table of Contents  Behavioral Health System) and two of which are located in Nevada (Montevista Hospital and Red Rock Hospital) as well as one of our legacy facilities in Puerto Rico (Hospital San Juan Capestrano). We completed the divestiture of MeadowWood Behavioral Health System in July, 2011. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the FTC, we are required to divest the facilities in Nevada within approximately six months, and the facility in Puerto Rico within approximately nine months, from the date the agreement was finalized, which occurred on April 19, 2011. The operating results for the three former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada are discontinued operations during the three and six-month period ended June 30, 2011. Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our consolidated financial statements during the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses. The assets and liabilities for MeadowWood Behavioral Health System, Montevista Hospital, Red Rock Hospital and Hospital San Juan Capestrano are reflected as “held for sale” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010.  The following table shows the results of operations, on a combined basis, for MeadowWood Behavioral Health System, Montevista Hospital and Red Rock Hospital which are reflected as discontinued operations (amounts in thousands):                    Three Months EndedJune 30, 2011     Six Months EndedJune 30, 2011     Net revenues   $ 10,550     $ 20,810     Income from discontinued operations, before income tax expense     2,219       4,550     Income tax expense     (844 )      (1,743 )                          Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense   $ 1,375     $ 2,807                          Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates:  The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):                            Three Months Ended     Six Months Ended        June 30,     June 30,        2011     2010     2011     2010     Provision for income taxes   $ 66,395     $ 41,057     $ 140,404     $ 86,466     Income before income taxes     182,429       117,472       386,425       245,643                                               Effective tax rate     36.4 %      35.0 %      36.3 %      35.2 %                                             The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income before income taxes, minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for each of the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):                            Three Months Ended     Six Months Ended        June 30,     June 30,        2011     2010     2011     2010     Provision for income taxes   $ 66,395     $ 41,057     $ 140,404     $ 86,466     Income before income taxes     182,429       117,472       386,425       245,643     Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests     (12,385 )      (10,843 )      (28,179 )      (21,786 )                                              Income before income taxes, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests     170,044       106,629       358,246       223,857                                               Effective tax rate     39.0 %      38.5 %      39.2 %      38.6 %                                               41    Table of Contents The increase in the effective tax rates during the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, as compared to the comparable prior year periods, was primarily attributable to an increase in our blended effective state income tax rate due to a greater portion of our earnings being generated in several higher tax rate states.  Liquidity   Net cash provided by operating activities  Net cash provided by operating activities was $356 million during the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 and $228 million during the comparable period of the prior year. The net increase of $128 million was primarily attributable to the following:        •    a favorable change of $127 million due to an increase in net income plus depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation less gain on sale of assets;        •    a $61 million unfavorable change in accounts receivable;        •    a $51 million favorable change in accrued and deferred income taxes due primarily to an income tax overpayment relating to 2010;        •    a $32 million unfavorable change in other working capital accounts due primarily to timing of accounts payable and accrued compensation payments;        •    a $32 million favorable change in accrued insurance expense, net of commercial premiums paid, partially due to the above-mentioned $16 million reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves recorded during the second quarter of 2010, and;        •    $11 million of other combined net favorable changes.  Our days sales outstanding (“DSO”) are calculated by dividing our net revenue by the number of days in the six-month periods. The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance at June 30th of each year to obtain the DSO. Our DSO were 43 days at June 30, 2011 and 42 days at June 30, 2010.  Net cash used in investing activities  During the first six months of 2011, we used $126 million of net cash in investing activities as follows:        •    spent $116 million to finance capital expenditures including capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities;        •    spent $11 million in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application, and;        •    received $2 million of proceeds for the sale of the real property of a closed acute care facility and for sale of our ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center.  During the first six months of 2010, we used $125 million of net cash in investing activities as follows:        •    spent $122 million to finance capital expenditures related to the following: (i) construction costs related to the newly constructed Palmdale Regional Medical Center; (ii) construction costs related to multiple projects in process to add capacity to our busiest behavioral health facilities, and; (iii) capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities;        •    spent $8 million in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application, and;        •    received $5 million of combined proceeds in connection with the divestiture of our minority ownership interest in a healthcare technology company and sale of a portion of our ownership interest in an outpatient surgerycenter.  Net cash provided by/used in financing activities  During the first six months of 2011, we used $225 million of net cash in financing activities as follows:        •    spent $201 million on net repayments of debt due primarily to repayments pursuant to our Term Loan A, Term Loan B and revolving credit facilities;        •    generated $36 million of cash from additional borrowings pursuant to our accounts receivable securitization program;        •    spent $24 million on financing costs in connection with an amendment to our credit agreement (which includes our revolving credit agreement, Term Loan A and Term Loan B facilities) which was completed in March, 2011;        •    spent $23 million to pay profit distributions related to noncontrolling interests in majority owned businesses;        •    spent $6 million to repurchase shares of our Class B Common Stock;        •    spent $10 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $.05 per share, and;    42    Table of Contents     •    generated $2 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans.  During the first six months of 2010, we used $100 million of net cash provided by financing activities as follows:        •    spent $78 million on net repayments of debt due primarily to repayments pursuant to the previous revolving credit facility partially offset by increased borrowings pursuant to the previous accounts receivable securitization program;        •    spent $12 million to pay profit distributions related to noncontrolling interests in majority owned businesses;        •    spent $4 million to repurchase shares of our Class B Common Stock;        •    spent $10 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $.05 per share, and;        •    generated $4 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans.  2011 Expected Capital Expenditures:  During the remaining six months of 2011, we expect to spend approximately $160 million to $185 million on capital expenditures. We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and/or additional funds, as discussed below.  Capital Resources   Credit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities  On November 15, 2010, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with various financial institutions. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured credit facility in an initial aggregate amount of $3.45 billion, comprised of a new $800 million revolving credit facility, a $1.05 billion Term Loan A facility (amount at inception) and a $1.6 billion Term Loan B facility (amount at inception). Prior to the effectiveness of the Amendment in March, 2011 (as discussed below), we prepaid $125 million of the principal amount of the Term Loan B and, during the first six months of 2011, we made scheduled principal payments of $8 million on the Term Loan B and $13 million on the Term Loan A. The revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A mature on November 15, 2015 and the Term Loan B matures on November 16, 2016. The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries (the “Collateral”) and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.  On March 15, 2011, we entered into a first amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The Amendment provides, among other things, for a reduction in the interest rates payable in connection with borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Upon the effectiveness of the Amendment on March 15, 2011, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election (1) the greatest of (a) the lender’s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month LIBOR plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin of initially 1.25%, 1.25% and 2.00% for the revolving credit facility, the Term Loan A facility and the Term Loan B facility, respectively or (2) one, two, three or six month LIBOR (at our election), plus an applicable margin of initially 2.25%, 2.25% and 3.00% for the revolving credit facility, the Term Loan A facility and the Term Loan B facility, respectively. Commencing upon completion of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2011, the applicable margins for the Term Loan A facility and the revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment based upon our consolidated leverage ratio or corporate credit rating at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for ABR-based loans and 1.50% to 2.25% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility. The minimum Eurodollar rate for the Term Loan B facility was reduced from 1.50% to 1.00%. Commencing upon completion of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2011, the applicable margins for the Term Loan B facility are subject to adjustment based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.75% to 2.00% for ABR-based loans and 2.75% to 3.00% for LIBOR-based loans. In connection with the Amendment, we paid a fee of 1.00% of the amounts outstanding under the Term Loan B in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.  In October, 2010, we amended our accounts receivable securitization program (“Securitization”) with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks. We increased the size of the Securitization to $240 million (the “Commitments”), from $200 million, and extended the maturity date to October 25, 2013. Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals (“Receivables”) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings. The interest rate on the borrowings is based on the commercial paper rate plus a spread of .475% and there is a facility fee of .375% required on 102% on the Commitments. We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings. We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us. The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities. The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks. The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans. We had $240 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program at June 30, 2011.    43    Table of Contents As of June 30, 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under a short-term, on-demand credit facility. Outstanding borrowings, if any, pursuant to this facility are classified as long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet since they can be refinanced through available borrowings under the terms of our Credit Agreement.  As of June 30, 2011, we had an aggregate of $590 million of available borrowing capacity pursuant to the terms of our Credit Agreement and Securitization, net of $65 million of outstanding letters of credit.  On September 29, 2010, we issued $250 million of 7.00% senior unsecured notes (the “Unsecured Notes”) which are scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018. Interest on the Unsecured Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on April 1st and October 1st of each year. The Unsecured Notes can be redeemed in whole at anytime subject to a make-whole call at treasury rate plus 50 basis points prior to October 1, 2014. They are also redeemable in whole or in part at a price of: (i) 103.5% on or after October 1, 2014; (ii) 101.75% on or after October 1, 2015, and; (iii) 100% on or after October 1, 2016. On April 14, 2011, we announced the commencement of an exchange offer for the Unsecured Notes that were originally issued in a private offering. In connection with the original sale of the Unsecured Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement in which we undertook to offer to exchange the outstanding notes for new notes (the “exchange notes”) to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2011, holders of the outstanding notes were able to exchange the outstanding notes for exchange notes in an equal principal amount. The exchange notes were substantially identical to the outstanding notes, except that the exchange notes were registered under the Securities Act and are freely tradable. The exchange offer expired on May 12, 2011.  On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior notes which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016 (the “7.125% Notes”). Interest on the 7.125% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 30th and December 30th of each year. In June, 2008, we issued an additional $150 million of 7.125% Notes which formed a single series with the original 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2006. Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to and trade interchangeably with, the 7.125% Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006.  During 2001, we issued $200 million of senior notes which have a 6.75% coupon rate and which mature on November 15, 2011 (the “6.75% Notes”). The interest on the 6.75% Notes is paid semiannually in arrears on May 15th and November 15th of each year. The 6.75% Notes can be redeemed in whole at any time and in part from time to time. Since we expect to have the borrowing capacity, and intend to refinance the 6.75% Notes upon their maturity in November, 2011 utilizing borrowings under our Credit Agreement, they are classified as long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2011.  In connection with the entering into of the Credit Agreement on November 15, 2010, and in accordance with the Indenture dated January 20, 2000 governing the rights of our existing notes, we entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which our 7.125% Notes (due in 2015) and our 6.75% Notes (due in 2011) will be equally and ratably secured with the lenders under the Credit Agreement with respect to the collateral for so long as the lenders under the Credit Agreement are so secured.  Our Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates and dividends; and requires compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as of June 30, 2011.  The carrying amount and fair value of our debt was $3.75 billion and $3.81 billion at June 30, 2011, respectively. The fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions.  Our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 63% at June 30, 2011 and 66% at December 31, 2010.  We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay dividends and potentially repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) the issuance of equity; (ii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility or through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement, and/or; (iii) the issuance of other long-term debt. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   During the three months ended June 30, 2011, there have been no material changes in the off-balance sheet arrangements consisting of operating leases and standby letters of credit and surety bonds. Reference is made to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.    44    Table of Contents We have various obligations under operating leases or master leases for real property and under operating leases for equipment. The real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income. We sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received from these subleases are offset against the expense. In addition, we lease four hospital facilities from Universal Health Realty Income Trust with terms scheduled to expire in 2014 and 2016. These leases contain up to four, 5-year renewal options. In connection with the leases on three of these hospital facilities, in May, 2011, certain of our subsidiaries provided the required notice to the Universal Health Realty Income Trust exercising the 5-year renewal options on McAllen Medical Center, Wellington Regional Medical Center and Southwest Healthcare System, Inland Valley Campus. The lease terms on these facilities were extended to December, 2016.  As of June 30, 2011 we were party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds. Our outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of June 30, 2011 totaled $76 million consisting of: (i) $62 million related to our self-insurance programs; (ii) $7 million related primarily to pending appeals of legal judgments (including judgments related to professional and general liability claims), and; (iii) $7 million of other debt guarantees related to public utilities and entities in which we own a minority interest.      Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   There have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures during the six months ended June 30, 2011. Reference is made to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.      Item 4. Controls and Procedures   As of June 30, 2011, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure obligations under the 1934 Act and the SEC rules thereunder.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the second quarter of 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1. Legal Proceedings   We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to litigation, as outlined below.  U.S. v. Marion and UHS:  In late 2007, July, 2008 and January, 2009, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) issued a series of subpoenas seeking documents related to the treatment of Medicaid beneficiaries at two of our facilities, Marion Youth Center and Mountain Youth Academy. It was our understanding at that time that the OIG was investigating whether claims for reimbursement submitted by those facilities to the Virginia Medicaid program were supported by adequate documentation of the services provided which could be considered to be a basis for a false claims act violation. In August, 2008, the Office of the Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Virginia issued a subpoena to Keystone Newport News, another of our facilities. It was our understanding at that time that the Office of Attorney General was investigating whether Keystone Newport News complied with various Virginia laws and regulations, including documentation requirements.  In response to these subpoenas, we produced the requested documents and cooperated with the investigations in all respects. We also met with representatives of the OIG, the Virginia Attorney General, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, and the United States Department of Justice Civil Division on several occasions to discuss a possible resolution of this matter. However, the parties were not able to reach a resolution.  Consequently, in November, 2009, the United States Department of Justice and the Virginia Attorney General intervened in a qui tam case that had been filed by former employees of Marion Youth Center under seal in 2007 against Universal Health Services, Inc. (“UHS”), and Keystone Marion, LLC and Keystone Education and Youth Services, LLC (“Keystone”). The Department of Justice and the Commonwealth of Virginia filed and served their complaint which relates solely to the Marion Youth Center. The amended complaint alleges causes of action pursuant to the federal and state false claims acts and the Virginia fraud statute. The former employees filed a separate amended complaint, alleging employment and retaliation claims as well as false claim act violations. The case is in the discovery phase. A separate lawsuit has also been filed in federal court by another former employee of Keystone Marion in the Western District of Virginia making similar allegations in the context of employment and retaliation claims. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our results of operations for any of the periods presented herein. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously against the government’s and the former employees’ allegations. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in the litigation.    45    Table of Contents Martin v. UHS of Delaware:  UHS of Delaware, Inc., a subsidiary, and one of our non-public schools in California operated by one of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a state False Claim Act case in Sacramento County Superior Court. Plaintiffs are a former student and employees of the Elmira School who claim that the UHS schools in California unlawfully retained public education funding from the state of California for the operation of these schools but failed to meet state requirements to qualify as a non-public school. Plaintiffs have also claimed that we committed unfair business practices associated with these allegations. We deny liability and intend to defend this case vigorously. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Wage and Hour Class Actions:  We and/or our subsidiaries are presently involved in three wage and hour class action cases in California and Tennessee. All three matters have been settled but are awaiting court approval. The settlements in these cases, if approved by the court, will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Department of Justice ICD Investigation:  In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (“ICDs”) from 2003 to the present at several of our acute care facilities. The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Claims Determination regarding these devices. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Southwest Healthcare System:  During the third quarter of 2009, Southwest Healthcare System (“SWHCS”), which operates Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center in Riverside County, California, entered into an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The agreement required SWHCS to engage an independent quality monitor to assist SWHCS in meeting all CMS’ conditions of participation. Further, the agreement provided that, during the last 60 days of the agreement, CMS would conduct a full Medicare certification survey. That survey took place the week of January 11, 2010.  In April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from CMS that it intended to effectuate the termination of SWHCS’s Medicare provider agreement effective June 1, 2010. In May, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CMS which abated the termination action scheduled for June 1, 2010. The agreement is one year in duration and required SWHCS to engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for SWHCS to meet the Medicare conditions of participation. Pursuant to the agreement, CMS would conduct a full certification survey to determine if SWHCS has achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation. During the term of the agreement, SWHCS remains eligible to receive reimbursements from Medicare for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries. The certification survey commenced during the last week of July, 2011. We have not yet been notified as to the results of the survey and we are not aware of when notification will be made to us.  Also in April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from the California Department of Public Health (“CDPH”) indicating that it planned to initiate a process to revoke SWHCS’s hospital license. In May, 2010, SWHCS received the formal document related to the revocation action. In September, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CDPH relating to the license revocation. The terms of the CDPH agreement are substantially similar to those contained in the agreement with CMS. As a result of the agreement, SWHCS’s hospital license remains in effect pending the outcome of the CMS full certification survey which occurred during the last week of July, 2011. Pursuant to the results of the CMS full certification survey, should SWHCS be deemed to have achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, CDPH shall deem SWHCS’s license to be in good standing. Failure of SWHCS to achieve substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, pursuant to CMS’s full certification survey, will likely have a material adverse impact on SWHCS’s ability to continue to operate the facilities.  As a result of the matters discussed above, we were not previously permitted to open newly constructed capacity at Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center. However, in February, 2011, we received permission from CDPH to begin accessing the new capacity which has occurred. Unrelated to these developments, a competitor has recently opened a newly constructed acute care hospital. We are unable to predict the net impact of these developments on SWHCS’s results of operations during the remainder of 2011 and beyond.  Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center remain fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their patients and the communities they serve. We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with both CMS and CDPH in an effort to resolve these matters, although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. Failure to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on us. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 and the year ended December 31,    46    Table of Contents  2010, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, SWHCS had a pre-tax (deficit)/income of approximately (0.9%) and 1.1%, respectively, of our income from operations after income attributable to noncontrolling interest.  Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital:  On April 11, 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued notice of its decision terminating Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital (“Two Rivers”) in Kansas City, Missouri from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid program. The termination notice was issued as a result of surveys conducted which allegedly found Two Rivers to be out of compliance with the conditions of participation required for participation in the Medicare program and for Two Rivers’ alleged failure to alleviate an “immediate jeopardy” situation. Two Rivers filed an administrative appeal with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Departmental Appeal Board, Civil Remedies Division, seeking review and reversal of that decision. In addition, Two Rivers filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against CMS rescinding the termination action. On April 22, 2011, the District Court issued a temporary restraining order abating the termination action pending a preliminary injunction hearing or an agreement with CMS. On May 17, 2011, Two Rivers and CMS entered into a settlement agreement which resulted in the rescission of the termination notice and actions by CMS. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Two Rivers was required to submit an acceptable plan of correction relative to the immediate jeopardy citation and engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for Two Rivers to meet the applicable Medicare conditions of participation. Both of these actions have occurred. CMS will conduct an initial survey of Two Rivers, expected to occur in early 2012, to determine if the Medicare conditions of participation have been met. During the term of this agreement, Two Rivers remains eligible to receive reimbursements for services rendered to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Two Rivers remains fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their patients and the community it serves. We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with CMS in an effort to resolve these matters. We can provide no assurance that Two Rivers will not ultimately lose its Medicare certification. The operating results of Two Rivers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 or the year ended December 31, 2010.  Matters Relating to PSI:  The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.) for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition of PSI which was completed in November, 2010:  Garden City Employees’ Retirement System v. PSI:  This is a purported shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against PSI and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws. We are uncertain at this time as to potential liability and damages but intend to defend the case vigorously.  Department of Justice Investigation of Sierra Vista:  In 2009, Sierra Vista Hospital in Sacramento, California learned of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) relating to Medicare services provided by the facility. The DOJ ultimately notified the facility that with respect to partial hospitalization and outpatient services, the DOJ believed that the medical record documentation did not adequately support the claims submitted for reimbursement by Medicare. We recently reached a tentative financial settlement with the DOJ. The reserve established in connection with this matter did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. As part of that agreement, the facility will be subject to a corporate integrity agreement, the terms of which have not yet been finalized.  Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:  In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility. The requested documents have been collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination. Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July 2011 requesting additional documents. Those documents are being collected and will be provided to the DOJ. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.  Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital:  In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility. Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010. The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ and we continue to cooperate with the DOJ with respect to this investigation. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.  Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services Recoupment Claims:  The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (“DMAS”) has conducted audits at seven former PSI Residential Treatment Centers operated in the Commonwealth of Virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the state’s Medicaid Provider Services Manual (“Manual”). As a result of those audits, DMAS claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities. PSI had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending. The aggregate refund of Medicaid payments made to those facilities, as requested by DMAS, and the corresponding reserve established on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.    47    Table of Contents General:  Currently, and from time to time, some of our other facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies. If one of our facilities is found to have violated these laws and regulations, the facility may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. We do not believe that, other than as described above, any such existing action would materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  Other Matters  The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.  In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.      Item 1A. Risk Factors   Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 includes a listing of risk factors to be considered by investors in our securities. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.      Item 2.
