Item 1A Risk Factors and in Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors. Those factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any of our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following:        •  our ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations, and/or changes in laws and government regulations;        •  an increasing number of legislative initiatives have been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level. No assurances can be given that the implementation of these laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations;        •  in March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. The two combined primary goals of these acts are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses. Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade. Initiatives to repeal the ACA, in whole or in part, to delay elements of implementation or funding, and to offer amendments or supplements to modify its provisions, have been persistent and may increase as a result of the 2016 election. The ultimate outcomes of legislative attempts to repeal or amend the ACA and legal challenges to the ACA are unknown. Recent Congressional and Presidential election results created a political environment in which there have been repeated attempts to repeal or replace substantial portions of the ACA;         •  in May, 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to adopt legislation (the “AHCA”) to replace portions of the ACA. The legislation featured provisions that would have, in material part (i) eliminated the individual and large employer mandates to obtain or provide health insurance coverage, respectively; (ii) permitted insurers to impose a surcharge up to 30 percent on individuals who go uninsured for more than two months and then purchase coverage; (iii) provided tax credits towards the purchase of health insurance, with a phase-out of tax credits according to income level; (iv) expanded health savings accounts; (v) imposed a per capita cap on federal funding of state Medicaid programs, or, if elected by a state, transitioned federal funding to a block grant; and (vi) permitted states to seek a waiver of certain federal requirements that would have allowed such states to define essential health benefits differently from federal standards and that would allow certain commercial health plans to take health status, including pre-existing conditions, into account in setting premiums. Between June and September, 2017, the U.S. Senate evaluated various forms of proposed legislation substantially similar to the AHCA. The most recently evaluated healthcare bill would have provided block grants to state to use for health care, repealed the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA, and eliminated the tax credits that assist people purchasing insurance on the ACA exchanges. As of the date of this report, the U.S. Senate has not passed any of the various proposed amended forms of healthcare legislation. It is uncertain when or if any other bills similar to the AHCA or other bills amending or repealing all or portions of the ACA will be enacted. Effective September 30, 2017, the U.S. Senate lost the ability to adopt healthcare legislation by simple majority under reconciliation without another vote approving that process. However, Congress may seek to include legislative provisions similar to those adopted in the AHCA and as otherwise described herein in the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution or other omnibus legislation.         •  on October 11, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the formation of association health plans that would be exempt from certain ACA requirements such as the essential health benefits mandate. The executive order also: (i) provides for expanded access to short-term health plans that are limited under the ACA; (ii) seeks to expand how workers use employer-funded accounts to purchase their own policies, and; (iii) calls for an analysis of ways to limit consolidation within the insurance and health care industries;        •  additionally, on October 12, 2017, President Trump announced that ACA cost-sharing reduction payments will no longer be made to insurers. Cost sharing reduction payments help offset deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses for exchange health insurance coverage for approximately seven million individuals earning up to 250 percent of the federal  22          poverty level. The Congressional Budget Office previously reported that if cost sharing reduction payments were to end, premiums for silver-level plans would increase by 20% in 2018. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California challenging the Administration’s action and asking the court to issue a preliminary injunction, which was subsequently denied by the court, mandating that the Administration continue to make cost sharing reduction payments. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions announced a bipartisan proposal intended to continue cost sharing reduction payments, but no such legislation has been passed to date.        •  there can be no assurance that if the any of the announced or proposed changes described above are implemented there will not be negative financial impact on our hospitals, which material effects may include a potential decrease in the market for health care services or a decrease in our hospitals’ ability to receive reimbursement for health care services provided which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations;        •  possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government based payors, including Medicare or Medicaid in the United States, and government based payors in the United Kingdom;        •  our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same, including contracts with United/Sierra Healthcare in Las Vegas, Nevada;        •  the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us and other matters as disclosed in Item 1. Legal Proceedings;        •  the potential unfavorable impact on our business of deterioration in national, regional and local economic and business conditions, including a worsening of unfavorable credit market conditions;        •  competition from other healthcare providers (including physician owned facilities) in certain markets;        •  technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;        •  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals;        •  demographic changes;        •  our ability to successfully integrate and improve our recent acquisitions and the availability of suitable acquisitions and divestiture opportunities;        •  the impact of severe weather conditions, including the effects of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria;        •  as discussed below in Sources of Revenue, we receive revenues from various state and county based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate (we receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $100 million annually from each of Texas, California, Nevada, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, Illinois and Massachusetts); CMS-approved Medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including Texas, Mississippi, Illinois, Oklahoma, Nevada, Arkansas, California and Indiana, and; state Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including Texas and South Carolina. We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. We can provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;        •  our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund the future growth of our business;        •  our inpatient acute care and behavioral health care facilities may experience decreasing admission and length of stay trends;        •  our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations; 23         •  in August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) was enacted into law. The 2011 Act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the “Joint Committee”), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (annual reduction of approximately $36 million to our Medicare net revenues) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, continued the 2% reductions to Medicare reimbursement imposed under the 2011 Act. We cannot predict whether Congress will restructure the implemented Medicare payment reductions or what other federal budget deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress going forward;        •  in November, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives which, if enacted, would make significant changes to income taxation of individuals, corporations and estates. The proposed corporate income tax changes include a reduction in the corporate tax rate, a limitation on the deductibility of net interest expense, limitation on the deductibility and other treatment of certain employee compensation and a provision to allow for current expensing of certain capital expenditures. At this time, we are unable to predict whether any of these proposed corporate tax changes will be enacted or, if enacted, whether they will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations;        •  uninsured and self-pay patients treated at our acute care facilities unfavorably impact our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our self-pay patient accounts;        •  changes in our business strategies or development plans;        •  fluctuations in the value of our common stock, and;        •  other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Given these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. We assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Revenue recognition: We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided. Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 31% and 32% of our net patient revenues during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 31% and 32% of our net patient revenues during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs, accounted for 57% and 56% of our net patient revenues during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 56% of our net patient revenues during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts: See disclosure below in Results of Operations, Acute Care Hospital Services- Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts. Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks: We provide for self-insured risks including general and professional liability claims, workers’ compensation claims and healthcare and dental claims. Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. All relevant information,  24  including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense. In addition, we also: (i) own commercial health insurers headquartered in Reno, Nevada, and Puerto Rico and; (ii) maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims. The ultimate costs related to these programs/operations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported. Given our significant insurance-related exposure, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.  See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Commitments and Contingencies, for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability, workers’ compensation liability and property insurance.  The total accrual for our professional and general liability claims and workers’ compensation claims was $298 million as of September 30, 2017, of which $87 million is included in current liabilities. The total accrual for our professional and general liability claims and workers’ compensation claims was $274 million as of December 31, 2016, of which $81 million is included in current liabilities. Recent Accounting Standards: For a summary of accounting standards, please see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as included herein. Results of Operations Three-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016: The following table summarizes our results of operations and is used in the discussion below for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 (dollar amounts in thousands):             Three months ended September 30, 2017        Three months ended September 30, 2016             Amount        % of Net Revenues        Amount        % of Net Revenues       Net revenues before provision for doubtful accounts     $  2,775,790                    $  2,610,911                   Less: Provision for doubtful accounts        233,926                       201,039                   Net revenues        2,541,864           100.0  %        2,409,872           100.0  %    Operating charges:                                                    Salaries, wages and benefits        1,251,528           49.2  %        1,149,729           47.7  %    Other operating expenses        628,523           24.7  %        597,270           24.8  %    Supplies expense        268,089           10.5  %        257,793           10.7  %    Depreciation and amortization        110,217           4.3  %        103,712           4.3  %    Lease and rental expense        26,197           1.0  %        23,799           1.0  %    Subtotal-operating expenses        2,284,554           89.9  %        2,132,303           88.5  %    Income from operations        257,310           10.1  %        277,569           11.5  %    Interest expense, net        36,956           1.5  %        32,129           1.3  %    Income before income taxes        220,354           8.7  %        245,440           10.2  %    Provision for income taxes        74,992           3.0  %        88,175           3.7  %    Net income        145,362           5.7  %        157,265           6.5  %    Less: Income attributable to noncontrolling interests        4,117           0.2  %        5,400           0.2  %    Net income attributable to UHS     $  141,245           5.6  %     $  151,865           6.3  %     Net revenues increased 5.5%, or $132 million, to $2.54 billion during the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 as compared to $2.41 billion during the third quarter of 2016. The net increase was primarily attributable to: (i) a $47 million or 2.0% increase in net revenues generated from our acute care hospital services and behavioral health services operated during both periods (which we refer to as “same facility”), and; (ii) $85 million of other combined revenue increases consisting primarily of the revenues generated at the facilities acquired in December, 2016 in connection with our acquisition of Cambian Adult Services, and the revenues generated at Henderson Hospital, a newly constructed acute care hospital that was completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2016.  Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) decreased $25 million to $220 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 as compared to $245 million during the comparable quarter of  25  2016. The net decrease in our income before income taxes during the third quarter of 2017, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2016, was due to:        •  an increase of $9 million at our acute care facilities as discussed below in Acute Care Hospital Services;        •  a decrease of $17 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in Behavioral Health Services;        •  a decrease of $5 million due to an increase in interest expense, as discussed below in Other Operating Results, and;         •  $12 million of other combined net decreases, including a $9 million charge recorded during the third quarter of 2017 in connection with a court order in Texas related to certain litigation (see Item 1 - Legal Proceedings for additional disclosure). Net income attributable to UHS decreased $11 million to $141 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 as compared to $152 million during the comparable prior year quarter. Changes to our net income attributable to UHS during the third quarter of 2017, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, included:        •  a decrease of $25 million in income before income taxes, as discussed above;        •  an increase of $1 million resulting from a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and;         •  an increase of $13 million resulting from a net decrease in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from: (i) a decrease in the provision for income taxes resulting from the $24 million decrease in pre-tax income ($25 million decrease in income before income taxes partially offset by the $1 million decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interests); (ii) lower effective tax rates applicable to the income generated during the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 in connection with our acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC’s adult services division; (iii) a $2 million reduction to our provision for income taxes recorded during the third quarter of 2017 in connection with a change in estimated tax credits, and; (iv) a $1 million reduction to the provision for income taxes resulting from our January 1, 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”), as discussed herein.    Impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria:  We estimate that our pre-tax financial results for three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 were unfavorably impacted by approximately $13 million to $15 million related to the hurricane expenses and estimated business interruption impact incurred by 28 of our behavioral health care facilities located in Texas, Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and our 3 acute care hospitals located in Florida. Generally, our facilities impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria did not sustain extensive property damage and the vast majority have resumed normal operations. However, a portion of the beds at our 124-bed behavioral health facility located in Houston, Texas remain closed and, although our 3 behavioral health facilities located in Puerto Rico are operational (240 beds in the aggregate), they continue to operate on auxiliary power in areas that suffered extensive damage to surrounding infrastructure and properties. It is difficult to predict the impact that the hurricanes may have on the future operating results of these four facilities.  26  Nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016: The following table summarizes our results of operations and is used in the discussion below for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 (dollar amounts in thousands):             Nine months ended September 30, 2017        Nine months ended September 30, 2016             Amount        % of Net Revenues        Amount        % of Net Revenues       Net revenues before provision for doubtful accounts     $  8,428,971                    $  7,869,352                   Less: Provision for doubtful accounts        661,893                       578,827                   Net revenues        7,767,078           100.0  %        7,290,525           100.0  %    Operating charges:                                                    Salaries, wages and benefits        3,725,786           48.0  %        3,428,801           47.0  %    Other operating expenses        1,868,076           24.1  %        1,744,849           23.9  %    Supplies expense        820,242           10.6  %        767,465           10.5  %    Depreciation and amortization        334,127           4.3  %        309,172           4 2  %    Lease and rental expense        77,413           1.0  %        73,057           1.0  %    Subtotal-operating expenses        6,825,644           87.9  %        6,323,344           86.7  %    Income from operations        941,434           12.1  %        967,181           13.3  %    Interest expense, net        108,383           1.4  %        92,171           1.3  %    Income before income taxes        833,051           10.7  %        875,010           12.0  %    Provision for income taxes        286,774           3.7  %        306,577           4.2  %    Net income        546,277           7.0  %        568,433           7.8  %    Less: Income attributable to noncontrolling interests        13,583           0.2  %        40,232           0.6  %    Net income attributable to UHS     $  532,694           6.9  %     $  528,201           7.2  %     Net revenues increased 6.5%, or $477 million, to $7.77 billion during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 as compared to $7.29 billion during the first nine months of 2016. The net increase was primarily attributable to: (i) a $212 million or 3.0% increase in net revenues generated from our acute care hospital services and behavioral health services, on a same facility basis, and; (ii) $265 million of other combined revenue increases consisting primarily of the revenues generated at the facilities acquired in December, 2016 in connection with our acquisition of Cambian Adult Services, and the revenues generated at Henderson Hospital, a newly constructed acute care hospital that was completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2016.  Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) decreased $42 million to $833 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 as compared to $875 million during the comparable nine-month period of 2016. The net decrease in our income before income taxes during the first nine months of 2017, as compared to the comparable prior year period of 2016, was due to:        •  an increase of $32 million at our acute care facilities as discussed below in Acute Care Hospital Services;        •  a decrease of $51 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in Behavioral Health Services;        •  a decrease of $16 million due to an increase in interest expense, as discussed below in Other Operating Results, and;         •  $7 million of other combined net decreases, including the above-mentioned $9 million charge recorded during the third quarter of 2017 in connection with a court order in Texas related to certain litigation (see Item 1 - Legal Proceedings for additional disclosure). Net income attributable to UHS increased $5 million to $533 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 as compared to $528 million during the comparable prior year period. The increase during the first nine months of 2017, as compared to the comparable prior year period, consisted of:        •  a decrease of $42 million in income before income taxes, as discussed above;        •  an increase of $27 million resulting from a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests due primarily to the May, 2016 purchase of the minority ownership interests held by a third-party in six acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada, and;         •  an increase of $20 million resulting from a net decrease in the provision for income taxes resulting from: (i) an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting from the $15 million decrease in pre-tax income ($42 million decrease in income before income taxes partially offset by the $27 million decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interests); (ii) a  27          $9 million reduction to the provision for income taxes resulting from our January 1, 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, as discussed herein, and; (iii) lower effective tax rates applicable to the income generated during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 in connection with our acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC’s adult services division.    Acute Care Hospital Services Same Facility Basis Acute Care Hospital Services  We believe that providing our results on a “Same Facility” basis (which is a non-GAAP measure), which includes the operating results for facilities and businesses operated in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance. Our Same Facility results also neutralize (if applicable) the impact of the EHR applications, the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains/losses on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived assets and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods. Our Same Facility basis results reflected on the tables below also exclude from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below Sources of Revenue-Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs. However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under All Acute Care Hospital Services. The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses. To obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance, the Same Facility results should be examined in connection with our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis and is used in the discussion below for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 (dollar amounts in thousands):             Three months ended        Three months ended        Nine months ended        Nine months ended             September 30, 2017        September 30, 2016        September 30, 2017        September 30, 2016             Amount        % of Net Revenues        Amount        % of Net Revenues        Amount        % of Net Revenues        Amount        % of Net Revenues       Net revenues before provision for doubtful accounts     $  1,452,997                    $  1,402,732                    $  4,431,714                    $  4,224,695                   Less: Provision for doubtful accounts     $  196,542                       172,883                       548,387                       491,556                   Net revenues        1,256,455           100.0  %        1,229,849           100.0  %        3,883,327           100.0  %        3,733,139           100.0  %    Operating charges:                                                                                                    Salaries, wages and benefits        551,144           43.9  %        528,249           43.0  %        1,623,774           41.8  %        1,547,580           41.5  %    Other operating expenses        307,909           24.5  %        309,702           25.2  %        925,122           23.8  %        896,589           24.0  %    Supplies expense        212,350           16.9  %        210,973           17.2  %        654,218           16.8  %        621,258           16.6  %    Depreciation and amortization        62,446           5.0  %        59,252           4.8  %        185,151           4.8  %        174,855           4.7  %    Lease and rental expense        14,390           1.1  %        12,572           1.0  %        41,864           1.1  %        39,489           1.1  %    Subtotal-operating expenses        1,148,239           91.4  %        1,120,748           91.1  %        3,430,129           88.3  %        3,279,771           87.9  %    Income from operations        108,216           8.6  %        109,101           8.9  %        453,198           11.7  %        453,368           12.1  %    Interest expense, net        639           0.1  %        817           0.1  %        2,073           0.1  %        2,460           0.1  %    Income before income taxes     $  107,577           8.6  %     $  108,284           8.8  %     $  451,125           11.6  %     $  450,908           12.1  %   Three-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016: During the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, net revenues from our acute care hospital services, on a same facility basis, increased $27 million or 2.2%. Income before income taxes (and before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) decreased less than $1 million, or 1%, amounting to $108 million or 8.6% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2017 and $108 million or 8.8% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2016.  As discussed above, in connection with Hurricane Irma, we estimate that our pre-tax acute care hospital services’ financial results for three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 were unfavorably impacted by approximately $5 million to $6 million related to the hurricane expenses and estimated business interruption impact incurred by our 3 acute care hospitals located in Florida.  During the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, net revenue per adjusted admission decreased 0.6% while net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 1.3%, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2016. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, inpatient admissions to our acute care hospitals increased 5.1% and adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 3.5%. Patient days at these facilities increased 3.1% and adjusted patient days increased 1.5% during the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.5 days during each of the three-month periods ended September  28  30, 2017 and 2016. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 59% during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016.   Nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016: During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the comparable prior year period, net revenues from our acute care hospital services, on a same facility basis, increased $150 million or 4.0%. Income before income taxes (and before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) remained relatively unchanged at $451 million or 11.6% of net revenues during the first nine months of 2017 as compared to $451 million or 12.1% of net revenues during the comparable period of 2016.  During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, net revenue per adjusted admission decreased 0.3% while net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 2.5%, as compared to the comparable period of 2016. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the comparable prior year period, inpatient admissions to our acute care hospitals increased 5.5% and adjusted admissions increased 4.9%. Patient days at these facilities increased 2.5% and adjusted patient days increased 2.0% during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.5 days and 4.6 days during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 61% and 60% during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  All Acute Care Hospitals The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care operations during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016. These amounts include: (i) our acute care results on a same facility basis, as indicated above; (ii) the impact of the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals; (iii) the impact of provider tax assessments which increased net revenues and other operating expenses but had no impact on income before income taxes, and; (iv) certain other amounts including the results of a 25-bed acute care hospital located in Pahrump, Nevada that was acquired in August, 2016, the results of the newly constructed Henderson Hospital, a 130-bed acute care hospital located in Henderson, Nevada that was completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the favorable impact of Medicaid settlements relating to prior years that is included in our results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017.

Income before income taxes increased $9 million, or 9%, to $107 million or 8.1% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $98 million or 7.8% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2016.    Included in these results are the following:   29         •  the $1 million decrease in income before income taxes from our acute care hospital services, on a same facility basis, as discussed above, and;        •  other combined net increase of $10 million consisting primarily of the income generated at the two above-mentioned acute care hospitals located in Nevada that were acquired or opened during 2016.  Nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016: During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, net revenues from our acute care hospital services increased $278 million or 7.3% to $4.07 billion as compared to $3.79 billion due to: (i) a $150 million, or 4.0%, increase same facility revenues, as discussed above, and; (ii) other combined net increase of $128 million due primarily to the net revenues generated at the two above-mentioned acute care hospitals located in Nevada that were acquired or opened during 2016, and the $15 million of net revenues recorded (during the second quarter of 2017) in connection with Medicaid settlements relating to prior years.    Income before income taxes increased $32 million, or 8%, to $452 million or 11.1% of net revenues during the first nine months of 2017 as compared to $421 million or 11.1% of net revenues during the first nine months of 2016.   Included in these results are the following:        •  no change in income before income taxes from our acute care hospital services, on a same facility basis, as discussed above;        •  a net $6 million increase resulting from: (i) the income recorded in connection with Medicaid settlements relating to prior years ($15 million), partially offset by; (ii) increased professional and general liability expense relating to prior years that was recorded during the second quarter of 2017, based upon a reserve analysis ($9 million), and;         •  other combined net increase of $25 million consisting primarily of the income generated at the two above-mentioned acute care hospitals located in Nevada that were acquired or opened during 2016.  Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient’s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles. We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account. For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters. Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old. All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge. Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge. Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy. If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort. Historically, a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles. Generally, patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care. The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size. Effective January 1, 2016, our hospitals in certain states in which we operate reduced the charity care eligibility threshold to less than the federal poverty guidelines. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net. A portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states. Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient’s responsible party at the time of registration. At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned. There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered. Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible. When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending, our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates, subject to the ultimate disposition of the patient’s Medicaid eligibility. When the patient’s ultimate eligibility is determined, reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in  30  future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending. Although the patient’s ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period, these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 or 2016 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible. We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in “uninsured discounts” amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable. In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied. Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $469 million and $410 million at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The following tables show the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016: Uncompensated care:     Amounts in millions     Three Months Ended        Nine Months Ended             September 30,                    September 30,                    September 30,                    September 30,                            2017        %           2016        %           2017        %           2016        %       Charity care     $  216           48  %     $  175           47  %     $  723           53  %     $  508           48  %    Uninsured discounts     231           52  %     195           53  %     639           47  %     547           52  %    Total uncompensated care     $  447           100  %     $  370           100  %     $  1,362           100  %     $  1,055           100  %     As reflected on the tables above in All Acute Care Hospitals, the provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals amounted to approximately $205 million and $173 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $573 million and $492 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Estimated cost of providing uncompensated care: The estimated costs of providing uncompensated care as reflected below were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts. Amounts included in the provision for doubtful accounts, as mentioned above, are not included in the calculation of estimated costs of providing uncompensated care. The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities.

Our Same Facility basis results reflected on the tables below also exclude from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below Sources of Revenue-Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs. However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under All Behavioral Health Care Services. The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses. To obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance, the Same Facility results should be examined in connection with our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Income before income taxes decreased $21 million, or 9%, to $225 million or 19.6% of net revenues during the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, as compared to $246 million or 21.8% of net revenues during the comparable quarter of 2016.  As discussed above, in connection with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, we estimate that our pre-tax behavioral health services’ financial results for three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 were unfavorably impacted by approximately $8 million to $9 million related to the hurricane expenses and estimated business interruption impact incurred by 28 of our behavioral health care facilities located in Texas, Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Generally, our behavioral health care facilities impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria did not sustain extensive property damage and the vast majority have resumed normal operations. However, a portion of the beds at our 124-bed behavioral health facility located in Houston, Texas remain closed and, although our 3 behavioral health facilities located in Puerto Rico are operational (240 beds in the aggregate), they continue to operate on auxiliary power in areas that suffered extensive damage to surrounding infrastructure and properties. It is difficult to predict the impact that the hurricanes may have on the future operating results of these four facilities.  During the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, net revenue per adjusted admission increased 1.3% and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 2.6%, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2016. On a same facility basis, inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities increased 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the comparable quarter of 2016. Patient days were relatively unchanged and adjusted patient days decreased 0.2% during the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 12.8 days and 13.0 days during the three-month periods ended  32  September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 74% and 75% during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016: On a same facility basis during the first nine months of 2017, as compared to the comparable period of 2016, net revenues generated from our behavioral health services increased $61 million, or 1.8%, to $3.48 billion from $3.42 billion. Income before income taxes decreased $52 million, or 7%, to $738 million or 21.2% of net revenues during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, as compared to $790 million or 23.1% of net revenues during the comparable period of 2016. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, net revenue per adjusted admission decreased 0.4% and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 1.5%, as compared to the comparable period of 2016. On a same facility basis, inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities increased 2.5% and 2.4% during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the comparable period of 2016. Patient days and adjusted patient days each increased 0.5% during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 12.8 days and 13.0 days during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 76% during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016.  In certain markets in which we operate, the ability of our behavioral health facilities to fully meet the demand for their services has been unfavorably impacted by a shortage of clinicians which includes psychiatrists, nurses and mental health technicians which has, at times, caused the closure of a portion of available bed capacity. As a result, we have instituted certain initiatives at the impacted facilities designed to enhance recruitment and retention of clinical staff. Although we believe the impact on these facilities is temporary, we can provide no assurance that these factors will not continue to unfavorably impact our patient volumes.  All Behavioral Health Care Facilities The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our behavioral health care services during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016. These amounts include: (i) our behavioral health care results on a same facility basis, as indicated above; (ii) the impact of provider tax assessments which increased net revenues and other operating expenses but had no impact on income before income taxes, and; (iii) certain other amounts including the results of facilities acquired or opened during the past twelve months including the behavioral health care facilities acquired in the U.K. in connection with our acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC’s adult services division which was acquired in late December, 2016.

Income before income taxes decreased $17 million, or 7%, to $229 million or 18.7% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $246 million or 21.3% during the third quarter of 2016. Included in these results are the following:        •  a $21 million decrease at our behavioral health care facilities on a same facility basis, as discussed above, and;         •  other combined net increase of $4 million consisting primarily of the income generated during the third quarter of 2017 at the facilities acquired in the Cambian Group, PLC’s adult services transaction in December, 2016.  Nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016: During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the comparable prior year period, net revenues generated from our behavioral health services increased $196 million or 5.6% due to: (i) the above-mentioned $61 million or 1.8% increase in net revenues on a same facility basis, and; (ii) $135 million of other combined net increases consisting primarily of the revenues generated at the facilities acquired in the U.K. in late December 2016 in connection with our acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC’s adult services division.

Included in these results are the following:        •  a $52 million decrease at our behavioral health care facilities on a same facility basis, as discussed above;         •  a $13 million decrease due to: (i) a prior year, Medicaid disproportionate share hospital revenue adjustment related to a certain state recorded during the second quarter of 2017 ($7 million), and; (ii) increased professional and general liability expense relating to prior years that was recorded during the second quarter of 2017, based upon a reserve analysis ($6 million), and;        •  other combined net increase of $14 million consisting primarily of the income generated during the first nine months of 2017 at the facilities acquired in the Cambian Group, PLC’s adult services transaction in December, 2016.  Sources of Revenue Overview: We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients. Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control. The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis. We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues. Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year. Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts. Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform: Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, and the federal budget deficit in  34  general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations. In March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872, P.L. 111-152), (the “Reconciliation Act”) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), (the “ACA”), were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below. Initiatives to repeal the ACA, in whole or in part, to delay elements of implementation or funding, and to offer amendments or supplements to modify its provisions, have been persistent and may increase as a result of the 2016 election. The ultimate outcomes of legislative attempts to repeal or amend the ACA and legal challenges to the ACA are unknown. Recent Congressional and Presidential election results created a political environment in which there have been repeated attempts to repeal or replace substantial portions of the ACA. In May, 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to adopt legislation (the “AHCA”) to replace portions of the ACA. The legislation featured provisions that would have, in material part (i) eliminated the individual and large employer mandates to obtain or provide health insurance coverage, respectively; (ii) permitted insurers to impose a surcharge up to 30 percent on individuals who go uninsured for more than two months and then purchase coverage; (iii) provided tax credits towards the purchase of health insurance, with a phase-out of tax credits according to income level; (iv) expanded health savings accounts; (v) imposed a per capita cap on federal funding of state Medicaid programs, or, if elected by a state, transitioned federal funding to a block grant; and (vi) permitted states to seek a waiver of certain federal requirements that would have allowed such states to define essential health benefits differently from federal standards and that would allow certain commercial health plans to take health status, including pre-existing conditions, into account in setting premiums. Between June and September, 2017, the U.S. Senate evaluated various forms of proposed legislation substantially similar to the AHCA. The most recently evaluated healthcare bill would have provided block grants to state to use for health care, repealed the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA, and eliminated the tax credits that assist people purchasing insurance on the ACA exchanges. As of the date of this report, the U.S. Senate has not passed any of the various proposed amended forms of healthcare legislation. It is uncertain when or if any other bills similar to the AHCA or other bills amending or repealing all or portions of the ACA will be enacted. Effective September 30, 2017, the U.S. Senate lost the ability to adopt healthcare legislation by simple majority under reconciliation without another vote approving that process. However, Congress may seek to include legislative provisions similar to those adopted in the AHCA and as otherwise described herein in the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution or other omnibus legislation.  On October 11, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the formation of association health plans that would be exempt from certain ACA requirements such as the essential health benefits mandate. The executive order also: (i) provides for expanded access to short-term health plans that are limited under the ACA; (ii) seeks to expand how workers use employer-funded accounts to purchase their own policies, and; (iii) calls for an analysis of ways to limit consolidation within the insurance and health care industries. Additionally, on October 12, 2017, President Trump announced that ACA cost-sharing reduction payments will no longer be made to insurers. Cost sharing reduction payments help offset deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses for exchange health insurance coverage for approximately seven million individuals earning up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level. The Congressional Budget Office previously reported that if cost sharing reduction payments were to end, premiums for silver-level plans would increase by 20% in 2018. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California challenging the Administration’s action and asking the court to issue a preliminary injunction, which was subsequently denied by the court, mandating that the Administration continue to make cost sharing reduction payments. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions announced a bipartisan proposal intended to continue cost sharing reduction payments, but no such legislation has been passed to date. There can be no assurance that if the any of the announced or proposed changes described above are implemented there will not be negative financial impact on our hospitals, which material effects may include a potential decrease in the market for health care services or a decrease in our hospitals’ ability to receive reimbursement for health care services provided which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The following table shows the approximate percentages of net patient revenue for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 presented on: (i) a combined basis for both our acute care and behavioral health facilities; (ii) for our acute care facilities only, and; (iii) for our behavioral health facilities only. Net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from established billing rates, which we derived from various sources of payment for the periods indicated. 35        Acute Care and Behavioral Health Facilities Combined     Percentage of Net Patient Revenues        Percentage of Net Patient Revenues             Three Months Ended        Nine Months Ended             September 30,        September 30,             2017        2016        2017        2016       Third Party Payors:                                                    Medicare        20  %        20  %        20  %        20  %    Medicaid        11  %        12  %        11  %        12  %    Managed Care (HMO and PPOs)        57  %        56  %        56  %        56  %    Other Sources        12  %        12  %        13  %        12  %    Total        100  %        100  %        100  %        100  %         Acute Care Facilities     Percentage of Net Patient Revenues        Percentage of Net Patient Revenues             Three Months Ended        Nine Months Ended             September 30,        September 30,             2017        2016        2017        2016       Third Party Payors:                                                    Medicare        25  %        25  %        25  %        25  %    Medicaid        7  %        7  %        7  %        7  %    Managed Care (HMO and PPOs)        65  %        64  %        64  %        64  %    Other Sources        3  %        4  %        4  %        4  %    Total        100  %        100  %        100  %        100  %         Behavioral Health Facilities     Percentage of Net Patient Revenues        Percentage of Net Patient Revenues             Three Months Ended        Nine Months Ended             September 30,        September 30,             2017        2016        2017        2016       Third Party Payors:                                                    Medicare        14  %        16  %        14  %        15  %    Medicaid        14  %        16  %        15  %        16  %    Managed Care (HMO and PPOs)        48  %        49  %        48  %        48  %    Other Sources        24  %        19  %        23  %        21  %    Total        100  %        100  %        100  %        100  %     Medicare: Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities. Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program. Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge. The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient’s Medicare severity diagnosis related group (“MS-DRG”). Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care. This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity. While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an “outlier” payment if a particular patient’s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold. MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the “hospital market basket index,” gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals. In August, 2017, CMS published its IPPS 2018 final payment rule which provides for a 2.9% market basket increase to the base  36  Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, without consideration for the decreases related to the required Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (“DSH”) payment changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments would approximate 2.3%. Including the estimated decrease to our DSH payments (approximating 0.1%) and certain other adjustments, we estimate our overall increase from the final IPPS 2018 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018) will approximate 1.8%. This projected impact from the IPPS 2018 final rule includes an increase of approximately 0.5% to partially restore cuts made as a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, as required by the 21st Century Cures Act but excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as discussed below. CMS will also begin using uncompensated care data from the 2014 hospital cost report Worksheet S-10, one-third weighting as part of the proxy methodology to allocate approximately $7 billion in the DSH Uncompensated Care Pool. This final rule change will result in wide variations among all hospitals nationwide in the distribution of these DSH funds compared to previous years. As a result of this final change by CMS, we could incur a material decrease in our DSH payments in federal fiscal year 2019 and forward if CMS increases the weighting of the Worksheet S-10 data in the DSH Pool allocation methodology.  In August, 2016, CMS published its IPPS 2017 final payment rule which provides for a 2.7% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, without consideration for the decreases related to the required DSH payment changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments would approximate 0.95%. Including the estimated decreases to our DSH payments (approximating -0.8%) and certain other adjustments, we estimate our overall decrease from the final IPPS 2017 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017) will approximate -0.2%. This projected impact from the IPPS 2017 final rule includes both the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as discussed below. In July, 2015, CMS published its IPPS 2016 final payment rule which provided for a 2.4% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, without consideration for the decreases related to the required Medicare DSH payment changes and decrease to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments approximated 1.1%. Including the decreases to our Medicare DSH payments (approximating 1.6%) and certain other adjustments, our overall decrease from the final IPPS 2016 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016) was approximately -0.1%. The impact from the IPPS 2016 final rule includes both the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as discussed below. In August, 2013, CMS published its final IPPS 2014 payment rule which expanded CMS’s policy under which it defines inpatient admissions to include the use of an objective time of care standard. Specifically, it would require Medicare’s external review contractors to presume that hospital inpatient admissions are reasonable and necessary when beneficiaries receive a physician order for admission and receive medically necessary services for at least two midnights (the “Two Midnight” rule). In October, 2015 as part of the 2016 Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”) final rule (additional related disclosure below), CMS will allow payment for one-midnight stays under the Medicare Part A benefit on a case-by case basis for rare and unusual exceptions based the presence of certain clinical factors. CMS also announced in the final rule that, effective October 1, 2015, Quality Improvement Organizations (“QIOs”) will conduct reviews of short inpatient stay reviews rather than Medicare Administrative Contractors. Additionally, CMS also announced that Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”) resumed patient status reviews for claims with admission dates of January 1, 2016 or later, and the agency indicates that RACs will conduct these reviews focused on providers with high denial rates that are referred by the QIOs. In its IPPS 2017 final payment rule, CMS: (i) reversed the Two-Midnight rule’s 0.2% reduction in hospital payments, and; (ii) implemented a temporary one-time increase of 0.8% in FFY2017 payments to offset cuts in the preceding fiscal years affected by the prior 0.2% reduction.  In August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) was enacted into law. Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, continued the 2% reductions to Medicare reimbursement imposed under the 2011 Act.  37  On January 2, 2013 ATRA was enacted which, among other things, includes a requirement for CMS to recoup $11 billion from hospitals from Medicare IPPS rates during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2017. The recoupment relates to IPPS documentation and coding adjustments for the period 2008 to 2013 for which adjustments were not previously applied by CMS. Both the 2014 and 2015 IPPS final rules include a -0.8% recoupment adjustment. CMS has included the same 0.8% recoupment adjustment in fiscal year 2016, a 1.5% recoupment adjustment in federal fiscal year 2017, and a 0.45% positive adjustment in fiscal year 2018 in order to recover the entire $11 billion. This adjustment is reflected in the IPPS estimated impact amounts noted above. On April 16, 2015, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 was enacted and an anticipated 3.2% payment increase in 2018 is scheduled to be phased in at approximately 0.5% per year over 6 years beginning in fiscal year 2018.  Inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program are paid under a Psychiatric Prospective Payment System (“Psych PPS”). Medicare payments to psychiatric hospitals are based on a prospective per diem rate with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics. The Psych PPS also contains provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. In August, 2017, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2018. Under this final rule, payments to our psychiatric hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 1.25% compared to federal fiscal year 2017. This amount includes the effect of the 2.6% market basket update less a 0.75% adjustment as required by the ACA and a 0.6% productivity adjustment. In July, 2016, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2017. Under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 2.3% compared to federal fiscal year 2016. This amount includes the effect of the 2.8% market basket update less a 0.2% adjustment as required by the ACA and a 0.3% productivity adjustment.  In July, 2015, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2016. Under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units increased by approximately 1.7% compared to federal fiscal year 2015. This amount includes the effect of the 2.4% market basket update less a 0.2% adjustment as required by the ACA and a 0.5% productivity adjustment. The final rule also updates the Inpatient Psychiatric Quality Reporting Program, which requires psychiatric facilities to report on quality measures or incur a reduction in their annual payment update. In November, 2017, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2018. The hospital market basket increase is 2.7%. The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.6% and 0.75% reduction to the 2017 OPPS market basket resulting in a 2018 OPPS market basket update at 1.35%. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2018 will aggregate to a net increase of 4.2% which includes a 0.8% increase to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates. When the behavioral health division’s partial hospitalization rate impact is excluded, we estimate that our Medicare 2018 OPPS payments will result in a 4.8% increase in payment levels for our acute care division, as compared to 2017. Additionally, the Medicare inpatient-only (IPO) list includes procedures that are only paid under the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System. Each year, CMS uses established criteria to review the IPO list and determine whether or not any procedures should be removed from the list. CMS is removing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) from the IPO list effective January 1, 2018. Additionally, CMS will redistribute $1.6 billion in cost savings within the OPPS system attributable to changes in the federal 340B hospital drug pricing payment methodology in 2018. The impact of these IPO and 340B changes are reflected in the above noted estimated acute care division percentage change in OPPS reimbursement. In November, 2016, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2017. The hospital market basket increase is 2.7%. The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.3% and 0.75% reduction to the 2017 OPPS market basket resulting in a 2017 OPPS market basket update at 1.65%. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2017 will aggregate to a net increase of 1.5% which includes a -1.3% decrease to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates. When the behavioral health division’s partial hospitalization rate impact is excluded, we estimate that our Medicare 2017 OPPS payments will result in a 2.1% increase in payment levels for our acute care division, as compared to 2016. In October, 2015, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2016. The hospital market basket increase is 2.8%. The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.2% reduction to the 2016 OPPS market basket. Additionally, CMS also proposes a reduction of 2.0%, which the CMS claims is necessary to eliminate $1 billion in excess laboratory payments that CMS packaged into OPPS payment rates in 2014 resulting in a 2016 OPPS market basket update at -0.3%. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2016 aggregated to a net decrease of approximately -0.2% which includes a 7.0% increase to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates. When the behavioral health division’s partial hospitalization rate impact is excluded, our Medicare 2016 OPPS payments resulted in a -1.6% decrease in payment levels for our acute care division, as compared to 2015. 38  In October, 2014, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2015. The hospital market basket increase is 2.9%. The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.2% reduction to the 2015 OPPS market basket resulting in a 2015 OPPS market basket update at 2.2%. In the final rule, CMS will reduce the 2015 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs. When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS for 2015 aggregated to a net increase of approximately 0.2%. Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2015 was approximately 1.5%. Medicaid: Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities. We receive revenues from various state and county based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate (we receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $100 million annually from each of Texas, California, Nevada, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Massachusetts); CMS-approved Medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including Texas, Mississippi, Illinois, Oklahoma, Nevada, Arkansas, California and Indiana, and; state Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including Texas and South Carolina. We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. We can provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.   The ACA substantially increases the federally and state-funded Medicaid insurance program, and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized non-Medicaid health plans for low-income residents not eligible for Medicaid starting in 2014. However, the Supreme Court has struck down portions of the ACA requiring states to expand their Medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding. Accordingly, many states in which we operate have not expanded Medicaid coverage to individuals at 133% of the federal poverty level. Facilities in states not opting to expand Medicaid coverage under the ACA may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments beginning in 2018, as discussed below. We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.   Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs:   We incur health-care related taxes (“Provider Taxes”) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items or services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services. Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state Medicaid programs. As outlined below, we derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments.    Included in these Provider Tax programs are reimbursements received in connection with Texas Uncompensated Care/Upper Payment Limit program (“UC/UPL”) and Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments program (“DSRIP”). Additional disclosure related to the Texas UC/UPL and DSRIP programs is provided below.    Texas Uncompensated Care/Upper Payment Limit Payments: Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hidalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in Medicaid supplemental payment Section 1115 Waiver indigent care programs. Section 1115 Waiver Uncompensated Care (“UC”) payments replace the former Upper Payment Limit (“UPL”) payments. These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties. Our hospitals receive both supplemental payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals. The supplemental payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer (“IGT”) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals. However, the county or hospital district is prohibited from entering into an agreement to condition any IGT on the amount of any private hospital’s indigent care obligation.    For state fiscal year 2017, Texas Medicaid continues to operate under a CMS-approved Section 1115 five-year Medicaid waiver demonstration program extended by CMS for fifteen months to December 31, 2017. The Texas Health and Human Services  39  Commission (“THHSC”) has also submitted a request to CMS for a 21-month extension of the 1115 waiver that would continue this UC and DSRIP funding through September 30, 2019. During the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal year 2012, the THHSC transitioned away from UPL payments to new waiver incentive payment programs, UC and DSRIP payments. During the first year of transition, which commenced on October 1, 2011, THHSC made payments to Medicaid UPL recipient providers that received payments during the state’s prior fiscal year. During demonstration years two through seven (October 1, 2012 through December 31, 2017), THHSC has, and will continue to, make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria are met by hospitals. Supplemental payments are also subject to aggregate statewide caps based on CMS approved Medicaid waiver amounts.   Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments: In addition, the Texas Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver includes a DSRIP pool to incentivize hospitals and other providers to transform their service delivery practices to improve quality, health status, patient experience, coordination, and cost-effectiveness. DSRIP pool payments are incentive payments to hospitals and other providers that develop programs or strategies to enhance access to health care, increase the quality of care, the cost-effectiveness of care provided and the health of the patients and families served. In May, 2014, CMS formally approved specific DSRIP projects for certain of our hospitals for demonstration years 3 to 5 (our facilities did not materially participate in the DSRIP pool during demonstration years 1 or 2). DSRIP payments are contingent on the hospital meeting certain pre-determined milestones, metrics and clinical outcomes. Additionally, DSRIP payments are contingent on a governmental entity providing an IGT for the non-federal share component of the DSRIP payment. THHSC generally approves DSRIP reported metrics, milestones and clinical outcomes on a semi-annual basis in June and December.    Summary of Amounts Related To The Above-Mentioned Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs:  The following table summarizes the revenues, Provider Taxes and net benefit related to each of the above-mentioned Medicaid supplemental programs for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016. The Provider Taxes are recorded in other operating expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as included herein.

This estimate is based upon various terms and conditions that are out of our control including, but not limited to, the states’/CMS’s continued approval of the programs and the applicable hospital district or county making IGTs consistent with 2016 levels. Future changes to these terms and conditions could materially reduce our net benefit derived from the programs which could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations. In addition, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations. 40  Texas and South Carolina Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: Hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a DSH adjustment. Congress established a national limit on DSH adjustments. Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the Medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse.  Upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas’ and South Carolina’s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received additional reimbursement from each state’s DSH fund. The South Carolina and Texas DSH programs were renewed for each state’s 2018 DSH fiscal year (covering the period of October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018).  In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of approximately $10 million and $11 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $27 million and $29 million during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a result of the federal DSH reductions required under the ACA (as outlined in Health Care Reform below), we expect the aggregate reimbursements to our hospitals pursuant to the Texas and South Carolina 2018 fiscal year programs to be approximately $30 million which will be less than the aggregate 2017 fiscal year amounts.  The ACA and subsequent federal legislation provides for a significant reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2018 (see below in Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform-Medicaid Revisions for additional disclosure). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is to determine the amount of Medicaid DSH payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology. As Medicaid DSH payments to states will be cut, consequently, payments to Medicaid-participating providers, including our hospitals in Texas and South Carolina, will be reduced in the coming years. Based on the CMS proposed rule published in July, 2017, Medicaid DSH payments in South Carolina and Texas could be reduced by approximately 20% and 14%, respectively, over the prior federal fiscal year.    Nevada SPA:   In Nevada, CMS approved a state plan amendment (“SPA”) in August, 2014 that implemented a hospital supplemental payment program retroactive to January 1, 2014. This SPA has been approved for additional state fiscal years including the 2018 fiscal year covering the period of July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018.    In connection with this program, included in our financial results was approximately $6 million and $4 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively and $16 million and $9 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Assuming the program is approved for the state’s 2019 fiscal year, we estimate that our reimbursements will be at amounts similar to 2017 fiscal year program amounts.    Risk Factors Related To State Supplemental Medicaid Payments:   As outlined above, we receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental Medicaid payment programs. The states include, but are not limited to, Texas, Mississippi, Illinois, Oklahoma, Nevada, Arkansas, California and Indiana. Failure to renew these programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary IGTs for the states’ share of the DSH programs, failure of our hospitals that currently receive supplemental Medicaid revenues to qualify for future funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.   In April, 2016, CMS published its final Medicaid Managed Care Rule which explicitly permits but phases out the use of pass-through payments (including supplemental payments) by Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (“MCO”) to hospitals over ten years but allows for a transition of the pass-through payments into value-based payment structures, delivery system reform initiatives or payments tied to services under a MCO contract. Since we are unable to determine the financial impact of this aspect of the final rule, we can provide no assurance that the final rule will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.   Massachusetts Health Safety Net Care Pool (“SCNP”) Included in our financial results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 was a $7 million pre-tax charge incurred to establish a reserve related to Massachusetts Health SNCP payments received by certain of our behavioral health facilities during the period October, 2014 through December, 2016. SNCP payments are made by Massachusetts under the current CMS approved Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver available to Institutions of Medical Disease. During the second quarter of 2017, we received notification that such payments are subject to a retroactively applied uncompensated care cost limit protocol.  41  HITECH Act: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations implementing the health information technology (“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria. The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate have chosen to participate. Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful use” criteria. The government’s ultimate goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all Americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system. Pursuant to HITECH Act regulations, hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015. However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year. Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations. In connection with the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals, our consolidated results of operations include net pre-tax charges of $4 million and $9 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $19 million and $25 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These net pre-tax charges consisted of depreciation and amortization expense related to the costs incurred for the purchase and development of the application, net of the portion of the net expense that was attributable to noncontrolling interests.   Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable “meaningful use” requirements. Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31st, we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the “meaningful use” criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year. Managed Care: A significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs. In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow. The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate. Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies. Commercial Insurance: Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance. Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital’s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy. Private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor. Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services. To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers’ reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals. Other Sources: Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage. Such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals’ indigent and charity care policy. Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances. Health Care Reform: Listed below are the Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are have been, or are scheduled to be, implemented as a result of the ACA.  42  Implemented Medicare Reductions and Reforms:                 •  The Reconciliation Act reduced the market basket update for inpatient and outpatient hospitals and inpatient behavioral health facilities by 0.25% in each of 2010 and 2011, by 0.10% in each of 2012 and 2013, 0.30% in 2014, 0.20% in each of 2015 and 2016 and 0.75% in each of 2017 and 2018.        •  The ACA implemented certain reforms to Medicare Advantage payments, effective in 2011.       •  A Medicare shared savings program, effective in 2012.       •  A hospital readmissions reduction program, effective in 2012.       •  A value-based purchasing program for hospitals, effective in 2012.       •  A national pilot program on payment bundling, effective in 2013.       •  Reduction to Medicare DSH payments, effective in 2014, as discussed above.   Medicaid Revisions:              •  Expanded Medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments, effective in 2014.       •  The ACA (as amended by subsequent federal legislation) requires annual aggregate reductions in federal DSH funding from federal fiscal year (“FFY”) 2018 through FFY 2025. The aggregate annual reduction amounts are $2.0 billion for FFY 2018, $3.0 billion for FFY 2019, $4.0 billion for FFY 2020, $5.0 billion for FFY 2021, $6.0 billion for FFY 2022, $7.0 billion for FFY 2023, and $8.0 billion for each of FFY 2024 and 2025.    Health Insurance Revisions:               •  Large employer insurance reforms, effective in 2015.       •  Individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies, effective in 2014.       •  Federally mandated insurance coverage reforms, effective in 2010 and forward.   The ACA seeks to increase competition among private health insurers by providing for transparent federal and state insurance exchanges. The ACA also prohibits private insurers from adjusting insurance premiums based on health status, gender, or other specified factors. We cannot provide assurance that these provisions will not adversely affect the ability of private insurers to pay for services provided to insured patients, or that these changes will not have a negative material impact on our results of operations going forward. Value-Based Purchasing: There is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events. Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. The ACA contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing. The ACA prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions (“HAC”). Beginning in FFY 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments. Additionally, hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard. The ACA also required HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on October 1, 2012. The ACA requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1% in FFY 2013 and increasing by 0.25% each fiscal year up to 2% in FFY 2017 and subsequent years. HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS. HHS will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions. In its fiscal year 2016 IPPS final rule, CMS funded the value- 43  based purchasing program by reducing base operating DRG payment amounts to participating hospitals by 1.75%. For FFY 2017, this reduction was increased to its maximum of 2%. Readmission Reduction Program: In the ACA, Congress also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program (“HRRP”). The HRRP currently assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates for heart failure, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA), excluding planned readmissions, when compared to expected rates. In the fiscal year 2015 IPPS final rule, CMS added readmissions for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgical procedures beginning in fiscal year 2017. The impact of HRRP has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Accountable Care Organizations: The ACA requires HHS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations (“ACOs”). The ACO program allows providers (including hospitals), physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. In addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities. The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers’ rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments. Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.   Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results. 44  Other Operating Results Interest Expense: As reflected on the schedule below, interest expense was $37 million and $32 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $108 million and $92 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively (amounts in thousands):             Three Months Ended September 30, 2017        Three Months Ended September 30, 2016        Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017        Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016       Revolving credit & demand notes (a.)     $  2,976        $  578        $  8,055        $  3,917       $400 million, 7.125% Senior Notes due 2016 (b.)        -           -           -           12,031       $300 million, 3.75% Senior Notes due 2019        2,812           2,812           8,437           8,437       $700 million, 4.75% Senior Notes due 2022, net (c.)        8,070           8,070           24,210           16,558       $400 million, 5.00% Senior Notes due 2026 (d.)        5,000           5,000           15,000           6,556       Term loan facility A (a.)        12,654           9,663           34,956           26,637       Accounts receivable securitization program (e.)        2,205           1,130           5,701           3,540       Subtotal-revolving credit, demand notes, Senior Notes,  term loan facility and accounts receivable  securitization program        33,717           27,253           96,359           77,676       Interest rate swap expense, net        246           2,146           2,337           6,606       Amortization of financing fees        2,239           2,221           6,690           5,985       Other combined interest expense        1,070           1,246           3,711           3,811       Capitalized interest on major projects        (299  )        (712  )        (672  )        (1,839  )    Interest income        (17  )        (25  )        (42  )        (68  )    Interest expense, net     $  36,956        $  32,129        $  108,383        $  92,171               (a.)  In June, 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment to our credit agreement dated November 15, 2010, as amended, to increase the size of the Term Loan A facility by $200 million. Interest rates were not impacted by this amendment. The credit agreement, as amended, which is scheduled to expire in August, 2019, consists of: (i) an $800 million revolving credit facility ($380 million of outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2017, and; (ii) a Term Loan A facility with $1.80 billion outstanding as of September 30, 2017.         (b.)  The $400 million, 7.125% Senior Notes matured and were repaid in June, 2016 utilizing a portion of the funds generated from the debt issuances discussed in (a.), (c.) and (d.).         (c.)  In June, 2016, we completed the offering of an additional $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due in 2022 (issued at a yield of 4.35%), the terms of which were identical to the terms of our $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due in 2022, issued in August, 2014. These Senior Notes, combined, are referred to as $700 million, 4.75% Senior Notes due in 2022.        (d.)  In June, 2016, we completed the offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Senior Notes due in 2026.         (e.)  In July, 2017, we amended our accounts receivable securitization program, which is scheduled to expire in December, 2018, to increase the borrowing limit to $440 million from $400 million ($435 million of borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2017).    Interest expense increased $5 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, and $16 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the comparable periods of 2016. The $5 million increase in interest expense during the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to: (i) a $6 million increase in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facility and accounts receivable securitization program resulting from an increase in the aggregate average outstanding borrowings ($4.04 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to $3.62 billion in the comparable 2016 period), as well as an increase in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities (3.3% during the three months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to 3.0% in the comparable period of 2016), partially offset by; (ii) a $2 million decrease in the interest rate swap expense.    The $16 million increase in interest expense during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, was primarily due to: (i) a $19 million increase in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facility and accounts receivable securitization program resulting from an increase in the aggregate average outstanding borrowings ($4.03 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to $3.51 billion in the comparable 2016 period), as well as an increase in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities  45  (3.2% during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to 2.9% in the comparable period of 2016); (ii) a $1 million increase due to a decrease in capitalized interest on major projects, partially offset by; (iii) a $4 million decrease in our interest rate swap expense.   Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates:   The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 (dollar amounts in thousands):            Three months ended        Nine month ended             September 30,        September 30,        September 30,        September 30,             2017        2016        2017        2016       Provision for income taxes     $  74,992        $  88,175        $  286,774        $  306,577       Income before income taxes        220,554           245,440           833,051           875,010       Effective tax rate        34.0  %        35.9  %        34.4  %        35.0  %     In May, 2016, we purchased third-party minority ownership interests in six acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Prior to that date, outside owners held various noncontrolling, minority ownership interests in eight of our acute care facilities and one behavioral health care facility. Each of these facilities are owned and operated by limited liability companies (“LLC”) or limited partnerships (“LP”). As a result, since there is no income tax liability incurred at the LLC/LP level (since it passes through to the members/partners), the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests does not include any income tax provision/benefit. When computing the provision for income taxes, as reflected on our consolidated statements of income, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from income before income taxes since it represents the third-party members’/partners’ share of the income generated by the joint-venture entities. In addition to providing the effective tax rates, as indicated above (as calculated from dividing the provision for income taxes by the income before income taxes as reflected on the consolidated statements of income), we believe it is helpful to our investors that we also provide our effective tax rate as calculated after giving effect to the portion of our pre-tax income that is attributable to the third-party members/partners. The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income before income taxes, minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 (dollar amounts in thousands):              Three months ended        Nine month ended                September 30,        September 30,        September 30,        September 30,                2017        2016        2017        2016       Provision for income taxes        $  74,992        $  88,175        $  286,774        $  306,577                                                               Income before income taxes           220,554           245,440           833,051           875,010       Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests           (4,117  )        (5,400  )        (13,583  )        (40,232  )    Income before income taxes and after net income                                                        attributable to noncontrolling interests           216,437           240,040           819,468           834,778       Effective tax rate           34.6  %        36.7  %        35.0  %        36.7  %     The decrease in the effective tax rate during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the comparable periods of 2016, was due primarily to: (i) reductions in the provision for income taxes of $1 million and $9 million during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017, respectively, resulting from our January 1, 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”, as discussed herein; (ii) lower effective income tax rates applicable to the income generated during the three and nine-month periods of 2017 at the behavioral health care facilities located in the U.K. that were acquired in late December, 2016 in connection with our acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC’s adult services division, and; (iii) a $2 million reduction to our provision for income taxes recorded during the third quarter of 2017 in connection with a change in estimated tax credits.  46  Liquidity Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $878 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 and $1.14 billion during the comparable period of 2016. The net decrease of $258 million was primarily attributable to the following:        •  an unfavorable change of $128 million in cash flows from forward exchange contracts related to our investments in the United Kingdom;         •  an unfavorable change of $101 million in other working capital accounts resulting primarily from changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to timing of disbursements;        •  an unfavorable change of $32 million in accrued and deferred income taxes        •  a favorable change of $17 million in accounts receivable, and;        •  $14 million of other combined net unfavorable changes. Days sales outstanding (“DSO”): Our DSO are calculated by dividing our net revenue by the number of days in the nine-month periods. The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance at September 30th of each year to obtain the DSO. Our DSO were 51 days and 49 days at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 include amounts due from Illinois of approximately $52 million and $38 million, respectively. Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures. Approximately $35 million as of September 30, 2017 and $25 million as of December 31, 2016, of the receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date. Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements. However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois. Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due to us from Illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows. Net cash used in investing activities The $468 million of net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2017 consisted of:         •  $419 million spent on capital expenditures including capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities;          •  $20 million spent to acquire businesses and property;          •  $26 million spent on the purchase and implementation of an information technology application, and;          •  $3 million spent to increase the statutorily required capital reserves of our commercial insurance subsidiary. The $532 million of net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2016 consisted of:         •  $396 million spent on capital expenditures, and;           •  $136 million spent to acquire businesses and property including the acquisition cost of Desert View Hospital, a 25-bed facility located in Pahrump, Nevada.  Net cash used in financing activities During the first nine months of 2017, we used $380 million of net cash in financing activities as follows:        •  spent $144 million on net repayments of debt as follows: (i) $67 million related to our term loan A facility; (ii) $75 million related to our revolving credit facility, and; (iii) $2 million related to other debt facilities;        •  generated $43 million of proceeds related to new borrowings pursuant to our accounts receivable securitization program ($36 million) and on demand credit facility ($7 million);        •  spent $243 million to repurchase shares of our Class B Common Stock in connection with: (i) income tax withholding obligations related to stock-based compensation programs ($14 million), and; (ii) open market purchases pursuant to our $800 million stock repurchase program ($229 million); 47         •  spent $16 million to pay profit distributions related to noncontrolling interests in majority owned businesses;        •  spent $29 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $.10 per share, and;        •  generated $8 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans. During the first nine months of 2016, we used $600 million of net cash in financing activities as follows:        •  spent $815 million on net repayments of debt as follows: (i) $400 million related to the 7.125% senior secured notes that matured in June, 2016; (ii) $300 million related to our revolving credit facility; (iii) $75 million related to our accounts receivable securitization program; (iv) $33 million related to our term loan A facility, and; (v) $7 million related to other debt facilities;        •  generated $1.026 billion of proceeds related to new borrowings as follows: (i) $406 million received in connection with the issuance of additional 4.75% senior secured notes due in 2022; (ii) $400 million received from the issuance of 5.0% senior secured notes due in 2026; (iii) $200 million of additional borrowings pursuant to our term loan A facility, and; (iv) $20 million of additional borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility;        •  spent $418 million to purchase third-party minority ownership interests in our six acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada;        •  spent $297 million to repurchase shares of our Class B Common Stock in connection with: (i) income tax withholding obligations related to stock-based compensation programs ($44 million), and; (ii) open market purchases pursuant to our $800 million stock repurchase program ($253 million);        •  spent $61 million to pay profit distributions related to noncontrolling interests in majority owned businesses;        •  spent $29 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $.10 per share;        •  spent $12 million on financing costs, and;        •  generated $6 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans. During the remaining three months of 2017, we expect to spend approximately $110 million to $140 million on capital expenditures which includes expenditures for capital equipment, renovations and new projects at existing hospitals. We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and/or additional funds, as discussed below. Capital Resources Credit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities On June 7, 2016, we entered into a Fifth Amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to our credit agreement dated as of November 15, 2010, as amended on March 15, 2011, September 21, 2012, May 16, 2013 and August 7, 2014, among UHS, as borrower, the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time parties thereto, as lenders (“Credit Agreement”). The Fifth Amendment increased the size of the term loan A facility by $200 million and those proceeds were utilized to repay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement, as amended, which is scheduled to mature in August, 2019, consists of: (i) an $800 million revolving credit facility ($380 million of borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2017), and; (ii) a term loan A facility with $1.798 billion of borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2017. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at our election at either (1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the lender’s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month LIBOR rate plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings, or (2) the one, two, three or six month LIBOR rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings. As of September 30, 2017, the applicable margins were 0.50% for ABR-based loans and 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit and term loan-A facilities. As of September 30, 2017, we had $380 million of borrowings outstanding pursuant to the terms of our $800 million revolving credit facility and we had $366 million of available borrowing capacity net of $33 million of outstanding letters of credit and $22 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to a short-term, on-demand credit facility. The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain assets of the Company (which generally excludes asset classes such as substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals, certain real estate assets and assets held in joint-ventures with third-parties) and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries. 48  Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, term loan-A installment payments of approximately $22 million per quarter commenced during the fourth quarter of 2016 and are scheduled through June, 2019. Previously, approximately $11 million of quarterly installment payments were made from the fourth quarter of 2014 through the third quarter of 2016.  In July, 2017, we amended our accounts receivable securitization program (“Securitization”) with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks to increase the borrowing capacity to $440 million from $400 million previously. Pursuant to the terms of our Securitization program, on which the scheduled maturity date of December, 2018 remained unchanged, substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals (“Receivables”) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings. We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings. We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us. The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities. The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks. The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans. At September 30, 2017, we had $435 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to the terms of the Securitization and $5 million of available borrowing capacity.  As of September 30, 2017, we had combined aggregate principal of $1.4 billion from the following senior secured notes:        •  $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior secured notes due in August, 2019 (“2019 Notes”) which were issued on August 7, 2014.         •  $700 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior secured notes due in August, 2022 (“2022 Notes”) which were issued as follows:        o  $300 million aggregate principal amount issued on August 7, 2014 at par.        o  $400 million aggregate principal amount issued on June 3, 2016 at 101.5% to yield 4.35%.        •  $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior secured notes due in June, 2026 (“2026 Notes”) which were issued on June 3, 2016. Interest is payable on the 2019 Notes and the 2022 Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year until the maturity date of August 1, 2019 for the 2019 Notes and August 1, 2022 for the 2022 Notes. Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 until the maturity date of June 1, 2026. The 2019 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2026 Notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The 2019 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2026 Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. In June, 2016, we repaid the $400 million, 7.125% senior secured notes which matured on June 30, 2016.  Our Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, dividends and stock repurchases; and requires compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as of September 30, 2017. At September 30, 2017, the net carrying value and fair value of our debt were approximately $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2016, the carrying value and fair value of our debt were each approximately $4.1 billion. The fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions. We consider these to be “level 2” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with debt instruments. Our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 45% at September 30, 2017 and 48% at December 31, 2016. We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay dividends and potentially repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility or through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement; (ii) the issuance of other long-term debt, and/or; (iii) the issuance of equity. We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity under our $800 million revolving credit facility and $440 million accounts receivable securitization program, as well as access to the capital markets, provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months. However, in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 49  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the three months ended September 30, 2017, there have been no material changes in the off-balance sheet arrangements consisting of operating leases and standby letters of credit and surety bonds. Reference is made to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of September 30, 2017 we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled $120 million consisting of: (i) $113 million related to our self-insurance programs, and; (ii) $7 million of other debt and public utility guarantees.  We have various obligations under operating leases or master leases for real property and under operating leases for equipment. The real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income. We sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received from these subleases are offset against the expense. In addition, we lease three hospital facilities from Universal Health Realty Trust (the “Trust”) with terms expiring in 2021. These leases contain up to two 5-year renewal options. We also lease two free-standing emergency departments and space in certain medical office buildings which are owned by the Trust. In addition, we lease the real property of certain other facilities from non-related parties.    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures during the three months ended September 30, 2017. Reference is made to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.    Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of September 30, 2017, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure obligations under the 1934 Act and the SEC rules thereunder. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the third quarter of 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   50  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION     Item 1. Legal Proceedings We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry which subjects us to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations. These claims or suits include claims for damages for personal injuries, medical malpractice, commercial/contractual disputes, wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians’ staff privileges, and employment related claims. In addition, health care companies are subject to investigations and/or actions by various state and federal governmental agencies or those bringing claims on their behalf. Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations against healthcare providers concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes as well as compliance with clinical and operational regulations. Currently, and from time to time, we and some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries in the form of subpoenas, Civil Investigative Demands, audits and other document requests from various federal and state agencies. These inquiries can lead to notices and/or actions including repayment obligations from state and federal government agencies associated with potential non-compliance with laws and regulations. Further, the federal False Claim Act allows private individuals to bring lawsuits (qui tam actions) against healthcare providers that submit claims for payments to the government. Various states have also adopted similar statutes. When such a claim is filed, the government will investigate the matter and decide if they are going to intervene in the pending case. These qui tam lawsuits are placed under seal by the court to comply with the False Claims Act’s requirements. If the government chooses not to intervene, the private individual(s) can proceed independently on behalf of the government. Health care providers that are found to violate the False Claims Act may be subject to substantial monetary fines/penalties as well as face potential exclusion from participating in government health care programs or be required to comply with Corporate Integrity Agreements as a condition of a settlement of a False Claim Act matter. In September 2014, the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) announced that all qui tam cases will be shared with their Division to determine if a parallel criminal investigation should be opened. The DOJ has also announced an intention to pursue civil and criminal actions against individuals within a company as well as the corporate entity or entities. In addition, health care facilities are subject to monitoring by state and federal surveyors to ensure compliance with program Conditions of Participation. In the event a facility is found to be out of compliance with a Condition of Participation and unable to remedy the alleged deficiency(s), the facility faces termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs or compliance with a System Improvement Agreement to remedy deficiencies and ensure compliance. The laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry are complex covering, among other things, government healthcare participation requirements, licensure, certification and accreditation, privacy of patient information, reimbursement for patient services as well as fraud and abuse compliance. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and expanding. Further, the Affordable Care Act has added additional obligations on healthcare providers to report and refund overpayments by government healthcare programs and authorizes the suspension of Medicare and Medicaid payments “pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud.” We monitor our business and have developed an ethics and compliance program with respect to these complex laws, rules and regulations. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with government regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with the sanctions referenced above which include fines, penalties and/or substantial damages, repayment obligations, payment suspensions, licensure revocation, and expulsion from government healthcare programs. Even if we were to ultimately prevail in any action brought against us or our facilities or in responding to any inquiry, such action or inquiry could have a material adverse effect on us. Certain legal matters are described below: Government Investigations: UHS Behavioral Health  In February, 2013, the Office of Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) served a subpoena requesting various documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. (“UHS”) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and certain UHS owned behavioral health facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health. Prior to receipt of this subpoena, some of these facilities had received independent subpoenas from state or federal agencies. Subsequent to the February 2013 subpoenas, some of the facilities above have received additional, specific subpoenas or other document and information requests. In addition to the OIG, the DOJ and various U.S. Attorneys’ and state Attorneys’ General Offices are also involved in this matter. Since February 2013, additional facilities have also received subpoenas and/or document and information requests or we have been notified are included in the omnibus investigation. Those facilities include: National Deaf Academy, Arbour-HRI Hospital, Behavioral Hospital of Bellaire, St. Simons By the Sea, Turning Point Care Center, Salt Lake Behavioral Health, Central Florida Behavioral Hospital, University Behavioral Center, Arbour Hospital, Arbour-Fuller Hospital, Pembroke Hospital, Westwood Lodge, Coastal Harbor Health System, Shadow Mountain Behavioral Health, Cedar Hills Hospital, Mayhill Hospital, Southern Crescent Behavioral Health (Anchor Hospital and Crescent Pines campuses), Valley  51  Hospital (AZ), Peachford Behavioral Health System of Atlanta, University Behavioral Health of Denton, and El Paso Behavioral Health System.   In October, 2013, we were advised that the DOJ’s Criminal Frauds Section had opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center. Since that time, we have been notified that the Criminal Frauds section has opened investigations of National Deaf Academy, Hartgrove Hospital and UHS as a corporate entity. In April 2017, the DOJ’s Criminal Division issued a subpoena requesting documentation from Shadow Mountain Behavioral Health. In August 2017, Kempsville Center of Behavioral Health (a part of Harbor Point Behavioral Health previously identified above) received a subpoena requesting documentation.  In April, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) instituted a Medicare payment suspension at River Point Behavioral Health in accordance with federal regulations regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (“AHCA”) subsequently issued a Medicaid payment suspension for the facility. River Point Behavioral Health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension. Notwithstanding, CMS continued the payment suspension. River Point Behavioral Health provided additional information to CMS in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the Medicare suspension remains in effect. In June 2017, AHCA advised that while they were maintaining the suspension for dual eligible and cross-over Medicare beneficiaries, the Medicaid payment suspension was lifted effective June 27, 2017. We cannot predict if and/or when the facility’s remaining suspended payments will resume in total. Although the operating results of River Point Behavioral Health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 or the year ended December 31, 2016, the payment suspension has had a material adverse effect on the facility’s results of operations and financial condition. The DOJ has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated investigation referenced above is a False Claims Act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities. At present, we are uncertain as to potential liability and/or financial exposure of the Company and/or individual facilities, if any, in connection with these matters. Litigation: U.S. ex rel Escobar v. Universal Health Services, Inc. et.al.  This is a False Claims Act case filed against Universal Health Services, Inc., UHS of Delaware, Inc. and HRI Clinics, Inc. d/b/a Arbour Counseling Services in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. This qui tam action primarily alleges that Arbour Counseling Services failed to appropriately supervise certain clinical providers in contravention of regulatory requirements and the submission of claims to Medicaid were subsequently improper. Relators make other claims of improper billing to Medicaid associated with alleged failures of Arbour Counseling to comply with state regulations. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office initially declined to intervene. UHS filed a motion to dismiss and the trial court originally granted the motion dismissing the case. The First Circuit Court of Appeals (“First Circuit”) reversed the trial court’s dismissal of the case. The United States Supreme Court subsequently vacated the First Circuit’s opinion and remanded the case for further consideration under the new legal standards established by the Supreme Court for False Claims Act cases. During the 4th quarter of 2016, the First Circuit issued a revised opinion upholding their reversal of the trial court’s dismissal. The case was then remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. In January 2017, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office advised of the potential for intervention in the case. The Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office subsequently filed its motion to intervene which was granted and, in April 2017, filed their Complaint in Intervention. We are defending this case vigorously. At this time, we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.  Shareholder Class Action  In December 2016 a purported shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against UHS, and certain UHS officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws. Plaintiff alleges that defendants violated federal securities laws relating to the disclosures made in public filings associated with practices at our behavioral health facilities. The case was originally filed as Heed v. Universal Health Services, Inc. et. al. (Case No. 2:16-CV-09499-PSG-JC). The court subsequently appointed Teamsters Local 456 Pension Fund and Teamsters Local 456 Annuity Fund to serve as lead plaintiffs. The case has been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the style of the case has been changed to Teamsters Local 456 Pension Fund, et. al. v. Universal Health Services, Inc. et. al. (Case No. 2:17-CV-02817-LS). In September, 2017, Teamsters Local 456 Pension Fund filed an amended complaint. We deny liability and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. At this time, we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.  Shareholder Derivative Cases  In March 2017, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by plaintiff David Heed in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. A notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania has been filed. Plaintiff has filed a motion to remand. The suit alleges breaches of fiduciary duties and other allegedly wrongful conduct by the members of the Board of Directors and certain officers of Universal Health Services, Inc. relating to practices at our behavioral health facilities. UHS has been named as a nominal defendant in the case. (Case No. 2:17-cv-01476-LS). In May, June and July 2017, additional shareholder  52  derivative suits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs in those cases are: Central Laborers’ Pension Fund (Case No. 17-cv-02187-LS); Firemen’s Retirement System of St. Louis (Case No. 17—cv-02317-LS); Waterford Township Police & Fire Retirement System (Case No. 17-cv-02595-LS); and Amalgamated Bank Longview Funds (Case No. 17-cv-03404-LS). The Fireman’s Retirement System case has since been voluntarily dismissed. In addition, a shareholder derivative case was filed in Chancery Court in Delaware by the Delaware County Employees’ Retirement Fund (Case No. 2017-0475-JTL). These additional cases make substantially similar allegations and claims based upon alleged violations of federal securities laws as well common law causes of action against the individual defendants. All of these additional cases have also named all members of the UHS Board of Directors as well as certain officers of the Company. The defendants deny liability and intend to defend these cases vigorously. At this time, we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with these matters. Chowdary v. Universal Health Services, Inc., et. al.  This is a lawsuit filed in 1999 in state court in Hidalgo County, Texas by a physician and his professional associations alleging tortious interference with contractual relationships and retaliation against McAllen Medical Center in McAllen, Texas as well as Universal Health Services, Inc. The state court has entered a summary judgment order awarding plaintiff $3.85 million in damages. With prejudgment interest, the total amount of the order amounts to approximately $8.5 million, for which a related expense and liability was included in our financial results for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017. A trial on punitive damages, emotional distress and attorneys’ fees remains to be conducted if the summary judgment order is not vacated. The case has been removed to federal court. Plaintiffs have filed a motion to remand. Once the remand motion is decided, we will file a motion for reconsideration and/or new trial. In the event the trial court does not grant the motion reversing the summary judgment order, we intend to appeal.  Disproportionate Share Hospital Payment Matter:  In late September, 2015, many hospitals in Pennsylvania, including seven of our behavioral health care hospitals located in the state, received letters from the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (the “Department”) demanding repayment of allegedly excess Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments (“DSH”) for the federal fiscal year 2011 (“FFY2011”) amounting to approximately $4 million in the aggregate. Since that time, we have received similar requests for repayment for alleged DSH overpayments for FFYs 2012 and 2013 aggregating to approximately $11 million. We filed administrative appeals for all of our facilities contesting the recoupment efforts for FFYs 2011 through 2013 as we believe the Department’s calculation methodology is inaccurate and conflicts with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. The Department has agreed to postpone the recoupment of the state’s share of the DSH payments until all hospital appeals are resolved but started recoupment of the federal share. The Department will likely make similar repayment demand for FFY 2014. Due to a change in the Pennsylvania Medicaid State Plan and implementation of a CMS-approved Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver, we do not believe the methodology applied by the Department to FFYs 2011 through 2013 is applicable to reimbursements received for Medicaid services provided after January 1, 2015 by our behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania. We can provide no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our legal and administrative appeals related to the Department’s repayment demands. If our legal and administrative appeals are unsuccessful, our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by these repayments.  Matters Relating to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”): The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of PSI) which were in existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010: Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital  In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility. Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010. The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ. All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI’s ownership prior to our acquisition. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter. 53  Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital  In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility. The requested documents were collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination. Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July, 2011 requesting additional documents, which have also been delivered to the DOJ. All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI’s ownership prior to our acquisition. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter. Other Matters: Various other suits, claims and investigations, including government subpoenas, arising against, or issued to, us are pending and additional such matters may arise in the future. Management will consider additional disclosure from time to time to the extent it believes such matters may be or become material. The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters described above or that are otherwise pending because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the matter is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes. It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.   Item 1A.
