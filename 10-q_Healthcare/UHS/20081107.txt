Item 1A. Risk Factors  General economic and credit market conditionsâ€”The deterioration in the general economic conditions has not yet had a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations. However, our future patient volumes, our ability to collect our outstanding accounts receivable and our overall future results of operations could be materially unfavorably impacted by continued deterioration in general economic conditions which could result in increases to the number of people unemployed and/or uninsured as well as potential reductions to our revenues due to decreased funding related to Medicaid and other healthcare programs in certain states. The ongoing tightening in the credit markets and the instability in the banking and financial institutions has not had a material impact on us. However, there can be no assurance that continued deterioration in credit market conditions will not have a material unfavorable impact on our ability to finance our future growth through borrowed funds.  There have been no other material changes in our risk factors from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.      Item 2.
