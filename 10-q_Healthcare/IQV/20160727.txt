Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the risk factors set forth in Part I — Item 1A — “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the “10-K”) and Part II — Item 1A — “Risk Factors” of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016 (the “10-Q”), investors should consider the following risk factors arising from our intention to combine with IMS Health through a “merger of equals” business combination (the “merger”). On May 3, 2016, we entered into a definitive merger agreement (the “merger agreement”) with IMS Health. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, IMS Health will be merged with and into us. Upon completion of the merger, the separate corporate existence of IMS Health will cease, and we will continue as the Surviving Corporation in the merger. Following a stockholder vote by both companies, the merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, although we cannot assure you that the transaction will close during that time or at all. The risk factors below should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in the 10-K and 10-Q and the other information contained in this report as our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks actually occur. 28  We will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending that may cause disruption from the transaction and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, suppliers or clients. Uncertainties about the effect of the merger on employees, clients, suppliers, business partners and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may have an adverse effect on us prior to the merger and on the Surviving Corporation following the merger. In connection with the pendency of the merger, as well as during times of significant change and uncertainty such as the period following the merger, clients, suppliers, business partners and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer business decisions, decide to terminate, modify or renegotiate their relationships with us, or take other actions as a result of the merger that could negatively affect the Surviving Corporation’s and/or our revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of our securities. The ability of the Surviving Corporation, or us to raise additional capital through the debt markets, and the associated borrowing costs, may also be negatively impacted. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of ours, including an adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation’s ability to realize the expected cost savings and other benefits of the merger. The risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement. Employee execution of retention agreements and recruitment of additional employees may be particularly challenging prior to the completion of the merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Surviving Corporation. If, despite our retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or prospective key employees fail to accept employment with us because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the Surviving Corporation, our financial results could be adversely affected. Furthermore, the Surviving Corporation’s operational and financial performance following the merger could be adversely affected if it is unable to retain key employees and skilled workers of ours. The loss of the services of key employees and skilled workers and their experience and knowledge regarding our businesses could adversely affect the Surviving Corporation’s future operating results and its successful ongoing operation of the business. In addition, the merger agreement restricts us, without IMS Health’s consent, from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the merger occurs or the merger agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to their respective businesses prior to completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement. The Surviving Corporation may be unable to fully realize the competitive and operating synergies that are projected to be achieved through the combination of our services and IMS Health’s offerings. Part of the strategic rationale for the merger is the opportunity for the Surviving Corporation to potentially drive additional revenue and earnings through the utilization by us of IMS Health’s data assets and capabilities in accelerating clinical trials. However, the utilization of data in the two companies’ markets is still evolving and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the following:          •     government regulatory agencies and legislative bodies, including agencies and legislatures regulating the use of personal data, may impose new conditions or restrictions which affect the Surviving Corporation’s use of IMS Health data;            •     clients of the Surviving Corporation may decide that they will not award additional business to the Surviving Corporation based on its data capabilities;            •     implementation of any operational plans to create new data products and solutions for clients of the Surviving Corporation will likely be complex and technically challenging to implement, and may be subject to delays and cost overruns and there is no assurance that the implementation can be carried out effectively;            •     clinical research is a complex and evolving area, and creating effective approaches involving the use of third party data to drive more effective and efficient research outcomes is difficult and challenging; and            •     third parties outside of our control (including suppliers, regulators, and clients) may impose restrictions or conditions which affect the projected data synergies arising from the transaction.   The Surviving Corporation is unable to predict the extent to which these factors will inhibit its business plans and any one of them could result in decreased or delays in post-closing performance by the Surviving Corporation. 29  We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. The Surviving Corporation may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the two businesses. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction will depend, to a large extent, on the Surviving Corporation’s ability to integrate the two businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we and IMS Health will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the realization of the full-expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the Surviving Corporation and could adversely affect the results of operations of the Surviving Corporation. In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of client relationships, and diversion of management’s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:          •     difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination;            •     difficulties in the integration of the companies’ businesses;            •     difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;            •     challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and            •     potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the merger.   Many of these factors will be outside of the control of the Surviving Corporation and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Surviving Corporation. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the transaction may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of ours and IMS Health. All of these factors could negatively impact the earnings per share of the Surviving Corporation, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction and negatively impact the price of the Surviving Corporation’s shares. As a result, there is no assurance that the combination of us and IMS Health will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the merger. Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock prices and our future business and financial results. If the merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of our or IMS Health stockholders failing to approve the applicable proposals, our ongoing businesses may be materially adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:          •     we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on their respective stock prices;            •     we and our respective subsidiaries may experience negative reactions from their respective clients, suppliers, regulators, vendors and employees;            •     we will still be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;            •     we may be required to pay one or more cash termination fees as required by the merger agreement;            •     the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of the respective businesses, which may have delayed or prevented us from undertaking business opportunities that, absent the merger agreement, we may have been pursued;            •     matters relating to the merger (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could have resulted in the distraction of our management from ongoing business operations and pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to the applicable company; and            •     litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform their respective obligations under the merger agreement.   If the merger is not completed, the risks described above may materialize and they may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial position and stock prices. 30  Any delay in completing the merger may reduce or eliminate the benefits expected to be achieved thereunder. The merger is subject to a number of conditions beyond our control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. We cannot predict whether and when these conditions will be satisfied. Any delay in completing the merger could cause the Surviving Corporation not to realize some or all of the operational and revenue synergies and other benefits that we expect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame.  Completion of the merger is subject to a number of conditions, which, if not satisfied or waived, may result in termination of the merger agreement. The merger agreement contains a number of conditions to completion of the merger, including, among others:          •     receipt of our requisite shareholder approval;            •     receipt of the requisite IMS Health stockholder approval;            •     the termination or expiration of any applicable waiting period under applicable law and any required waiting periods, clearances, consents or approvals under certain foreign antitrust laws having expired or been obtained;            •     the absence of any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment, order or decree issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint that prohibits or makes illegal the completion of the merger;            •     the effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form S-4, as amended (Registration No. 333-211794) and the absence of a stop order or proceedings threatened or initiated by the SEC for that purpose;            •     the accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the merger agreement by us, subject to certain materiality thresholds, and each party having performed, in all material respects, all obligations required to be performed by it under the merger agreement at or prior to the effective time of the merger; and            •     the non-occurrence of any fact, circumstance, development, event, change, occurrence or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on either party.   Many of the conditions to completion of the merger are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied. If any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to March 31, 2017, it is possible that the merger agreement may be terminated. Although we have agreed in the merger agreement to use reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to complete the merger in the most expeditious manner practicable, these and other conditions to completion of the merger may fail to be satisfied. The merger is subject to the receipt of consents and clearances from domestic and foreign regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or the Surviving Corporation or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the merger. Before the merger may be completed, applicable waiting periods must expire or terminate under antitrust and competition laws. In deciding whether to grant regulatory clearances, the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the merger on competition within their relevant jurisdiction. The terms and conditions of the approvals that are granted may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the Surviving Corporation’s business. The merger agreement may require us to comply with conditions imposed by regulatory entities and, in certain circumstances, we may refuse to close the merger on the basis of those regulatory conditions. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the merger, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the Surviving Corporation following the merger or result in abandonment of the merger. The future results of the Surviving Corporation will suffer if the Surviving Corporation does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the completion of the merger. Following the completion of the merger, the size of the business of the Surviving Corporation will increase significantly beyond the current size of either us or IMS Health. The Surviving Corporation’s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. If the Surviving Corporation is unsuccessful in managing its integrated operations, or if it does not realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger, the operations and financial condition of the Surviving Corporation could be adversely affected and the Surviving Corporation may not be able to take advantage of business development opportunities. 31  The merger may not be accretive and may cause dilution to the Surviving Corporation’s earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. We currently anticipate that the merger will be accretive to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the Surviving Corporation stockholders during 2017 using the respective calculation methods for us and assuming the achievement of revenue growth, cost savings and utilization of IMS Health tax assets. However, this expectation is based on preliminary estimates, which may change materially. The Surviving Corporation could also fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger or experience material delays or inefficiencies in realizing such benefits, which could cause dilution to the Surviving Corporation’s adjusted diluted earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and cause a decrease in the market value of the Surviving Corporation’s common stock. In connection with the completion of the merger, we expect to issue approximately 127 million shares of our common stock. The issuance of these new shares of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Any of these factors could negatively impact our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and cause a decrease in the market price of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Our business is subject to international economic, political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. We have significant operations in foreign countries that may require complex arrangements to deliver services on global contracts for our clients. Additionally, we have established operations in locations remote from our most developed business centers. As a result, we are subject to heightened risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including the following:          •     conducting a single clinical trial across multiple countries is complex, and issues in one country, such as a failure to comply with local regulations or restrictions, may affect the progress of the clinical trial in the other countries, for example, by limiting the amount of data necessary for a clinical trial to proceed, resulting in delays or potential cancellation of contracts, which in turn may result in loss of revenue;            •     the United States or foreign countries could enact legislation or impose regulations or other restrictions, including unfavorable labor regulations, tax policies or economic sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in or expatriate profits from the countries in which we operate;            •     foreign countries are expanding or may expand their regulatory framework with respect to patient informed consent, protection and compensation in clinical trials, which could delay or inhibit our ability to conduct clinical trials in such jurisdictions;            •     the regulatory or judicial authorities of foreign countries may not enforce legal rights and recognize business procedures in a manner in which we are accustomed or would reasonably expect;            •     changes in political and economic conditions may lead to changes in the business environment in which we operate, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including the recent United Kingdom referendum on its membership in the European Union that resulted in a majority of United Kingdom voters voting to exit the European Union (“Brexit”), which may result in increased risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates;            •     potential violations of local laws or anti-bribery laws, such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and the UK Bribery Act, may cause difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations, as well as significant consequences to us if those laws are violated;            •     clients in foreign jurisdictions may have longer payment cycles, and it may be more difficult to collect receivables in foreign jurisdictions; and            •     natural disasters, pandemics or international conflict, including terrorist acts, could interrupt our services, endanger our personnel or cause project delays or loss of clinical trial materials or results.
