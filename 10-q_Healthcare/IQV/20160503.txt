Item 1A. Risk Factors For a discussion of the risks relating to our business, see “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Aside from that described below, there have been no significant changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report. If our proposed merger with IMS is not consummated, our business could suffer and our stock price could decline. On May 3, 2016, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger, or the Merger Agreement, with IMS. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of our company and IMS, if the merger is completed, every 1 share of common stock of IMS issued and outstanding will be converted into and exchangeable for 0.3840 shares of our common stock. We currently expect the merger, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by our shareholders and the shareholders of IMS, to close in the second half of 2016. 24  The merger may present certain risks to our business and operations prior to its close, including the following:        ·  the merger is subject to the receipt of shareholder approval and the consents and clearances from domestic and foreign regulatory authorities, which, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the merger or cause a delay in completing the merger, or could result in conditions that might cause the parties to abandon the merger or reduce or eliminate the benefits expected to be achieved from the merger;        ·  a condition to closing of the merger may not be satisfied or the merger may not be completed for some reason, which may (i) have an adverse effect on our stock price to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the proposed merger will be completed, (ii) negatively affect our future business and financial results and (iii) in certain circumstances, result in an obligation to pay IMS a $250 million termination fee and to reimburse IMS for expenses incurred in connection with the termination;        ·  the disruption caused by the merger and the fact that our management’s attention and other resources may be focused on the merger instead of on day-to-day management activities, may harm our business, including current plans and operations or pursuing other opportunities beneficial to our company;        ·  we may lose management personnel and other key employees and be unable to attract and retain such personnel and employees;         ·  the proposed transactions may have adverse effects on or change relationships with customers, employees and suppliers;        ·  the potential business uncertainty, including attempts by some of our business partners or IMS’s business partners to change or terminate their relationships with us as a result of the proposed merger, could affect our financial condition;        ·  we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or strategic transactions that would otherwise be in our best interest as a standalone company due to restrictions in the merger agreement on our solicitation of competing acquisition proposals and the conduct of our business between the date of signing the merger agreement and the closing of the merger, all of which may affect our financial performance;        ·  we may incur substantial unexpected transaction fees and merger-related costs;        ·  we may invest significant time and resources in the transaction process, and the merger agreement may still be terminated; and        ·  litigation could be instituted against Quintiles or IMS or their respective directors.  In addition, certain risks may continue to exist after the closing of the merger, including the following:        ·  we may be unable to successfully integrate the large, geographically diverse and complex businesses and workforces of our company with those of IMS to achieve anticipated cost savings and other synergies, such as the integration of the data assets of IMS into the products and services we offer may not occur as anticipated, and the technology infrastructure required to do so may take longer to build or be more expensive than anticipated;        ·  the anticipated benefits of combining our company and IMS, including without limitation, anticipated revenues, expenses, earnings and other financial results, the growth and expansion of the new combined company’s operations and the anticipated tax treatment, may not be realized fully or at all;        ·  the combined company may lose management personnel and other key employees and be unable to attract and retain such personnel and employees;        ·  the combination of companies may preclude other business development opportunities;        ·  receipt of consents and clearances to the merger from domestic and foreign regulatory authorities may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on the combined company after the merger;         ·  management of the combined company, who have an in-depth knowledge of their respective businesses, might not be successful in managing the combined company, which will have distinct business lines that reach across different industries; 25         ·  completion of the merger may trigger assignment, change of control or other provisions in certain commercial contracts to which IMS is a party, such that counterparties may potentially have the right to terminate the contracts or give consent to the Merger; and         ·  launching branding or rebranding initiatives may involve substantial costs and may not be favorably received by customers of the combined companies.
