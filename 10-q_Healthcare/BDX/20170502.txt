Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.•Weakness in the global economy and financial markets, which could increase the cost of operating our business, weaken demand for our products and services, negatively impact the prices we can charge for our products and services, or impair our ability to produce our products.•Competitive factors that could adversely affect our operations, including new product introductions (for example, new forms of drug delivery) by our current or future competitors, increased pricing pressure due to the impact of low-cost manufacturers as certain competitors have established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers in low-cost manufacturing locations as a means to lower their costs, patents attained by competitors (particularly as patents on our products expire), and new entrants into our markets.•The adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. •Regional, national and foreign economic factors, including inflation, deflation, and fluctuations in interest rates, and their potential effect on our operating performance.•Our ability to achieve our projected level or mix of product sales, as our earnings forecasts are based on projected sales volumes and pricing of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others.•Changes in reimbursement practices of third-party payers or adverse decisions relating to our products by such payers, which could reduce demand for our products or the price we can charge for such products.•The impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "PPACA") in the United States, which implemented an excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices (which has been suspended until January 1, 2018), and which could result in reduced demand for our products, increased pricing pressures or otherwise adversely affect our business.•Future healthcare reform in the United States and other countries in which we do business that may involve changes in government pricing and reimbursement policies or other cost containment reforms.•Changes in domestic and foreign healthcare industry practices that result in a reduction in procedures using our products or increased pricing pressures, including the continued consolidation among healthcare providers and trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. •The impact of changes in U.S. federal laws and policy adopted under the new administration and Congress, including the effect that such changes will have on fiscal and tax policies, the potential repeal of all or portions of the PPACA, and international trade agreements and policies.•Fluctuations in the cost and availability of oil-based resins and other raw materials, as well as certain components, used in our products, the ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships (particularly with respect to sole-source suppliers), and the potential adverse effects of any disruption in the availability of such items.•Security breaches of our information technology systems or our products, which could impair our ability to conduct business, result in the loss of BD trade secrets or otherwise compromise sensitive information of BD or its customers, suppliers and other business partners, or of customers' patients, or result in product efficacy or safety concerns for certain of our products.•Difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, successfully complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and abroad, obtain intellectual property protection for our products, obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for new products, or gain and maintain market approval of products, as well as the possibility of infringement claims by competitors with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights, all of which can preclude or delay commercialization of a product. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or clearances from the FDA or other regulatory agencies or changes in the regulatory process may also delay product launches and increase development costs.•The impact of business combinations, including any volatility in earnings relating to acquisition-related costs, and our ability to successfully integrate any business we may acquire.•Our ability to penetrate or expand our operations in emerging markets, which depends on local economic and political conditions, and how well we are able to acquire or form strategic business alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities and distribution networks. Our international operations also increase our compliance risks, including risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws.28•Political conditions in international markets, including civil unrest, terrorist activity, governmental changes, trade barriers, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders and governmental expropriation of assets. This includes the possible impact of the June 2016 advisory referendum by British voters to exit the European Union, which has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the United Kingdom and the EU. •Deficit reduction efforts or other actions that reduce the availability of government funding for healthcare and research, which could weaken demand for our products and result in additional pricing pressures, as well as create potential collection risks associated with such sales.•Fluctuations in university or U.S. and international governmental funding and policies for life sciences research.•Fluctuations in the demand for products we sell to pharmaceutical companies that are used to manufacture, or are sold with, the products of such companies, as a result of funding constraints, consolidation or otherwise.•The effects of events that adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products (particularly where production of a product line is concentrated in one or more plants) or our ability to source materials or components from suppliers (including sole-source suppliers) that are needed for such manufacturing.•Pending and potential future litigation or other proceedings adverse to BD, including antitrust, product liability, environmental and patent infringement, and the availability or collectability of insurance relating to any such claims.•New or changing laws and regulations affecting our domestic and foreign operations, or changes in enforcement practices, including laws relating to trade, monetary and fiscal policies, taxation (including tax reforms that could adversely impact multinational corporations), sales practices, environmental protection, price controls, and licensing and regulatory requirements for new products and products in the postmarketing phase. In particular, the U.S. and other countries may impose new requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products. Environmental laws, particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD.•Product efficacy or safety concerns regarding our products resulting in product recalls, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or foreign counterparts, declining sales and product liability claims, particularly in light of the current regulatory environment, in which there has been increased enforcement activity by the FDA. As a result of the CareFusion acquisition, we are operating under a consent decree with the FDA relating to our U.S. infusion pump business. The consent decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing products, recall products or take other actions, and we may be required to pay significant monetary damages if we fail to comply with any provision of the consent decree.•Risks relating to our acquisition of CareFusion, including our ability to continue to successfully combine and integrate the CareFusion operations in order to fully obtain the anticipated benefits and costs savings from the transaction.•Risks related to our pending acquisition of Bard, including:◦The failure to satisfy the conditions to completing the transaction, including obtaining required regulatory approvals or approval of the Bard stockholders.◦Conditions to obtaining regulatory approval that may place restrictions on the business of the combined company.◦Our failure to obtain the anticipated benefits and costs savings from the acquisition.◦The impact of the additional debt we will incur and the equity and equity-linked securities that we will issue to finance the acquisition, including on our credit ratings and costs of borrowing.•The effect of adverse media exposure or other publicity regarding BD’s business or operations, including the effect on BD’s reputation or demand for its products.•The effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in BD’s pension plans and on actuarial interest rate and asset return assumptions, which could require BD to make additional contributions to the plans or increase our pension plan expense.•Our ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs, if any, that we may undertake.•Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission.The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any 29forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.30Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThere have been no material changes in information reported since the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.Item 4. Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation was carried out by BD’s management, with the participation of BD’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of BD’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of March 31, 2017. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were, as of the end of the period covered by this report, effective and designed to ensure that material information relating to BD and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within these entities. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 identified in connection with the above-referenced evaluation that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, BD’s internal control over financial reporting.31PART II - OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1. Legal ProceedingsWe are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business, including product liability and environmental matters as set forth in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Since December 31, 2016, there have been no material developments with respect to the legal proceedings in which we are involved, except as provided below.Antitrust and False Advertising ActionAs previously reported, on December 2, 2016, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion reversing the district court judgment as to RTI’s attempted monopolization claim and rendered judgment on that claim in favor of BD. The Court of Appeals affirmed the district court judgment for Lanham Act liability, and remanded the case to the district court to consider whether and if so how much profit should be disgorged by BD on that claim. The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded the injunction ordered by the Court. On January 31, 2017, RTI filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. On March 20, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari, and the matter will now return to the district court for a ruling on RTI’s request for disgorgement.SummaryGiven the uncertain nature of litigation generally, BD is not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which BD is a party. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, BD establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). In view of the uncertainties discussed above, BD could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BD’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows.32Item 1A. Risk FactorsThere were no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K during the period covered by this report, except as follows:Risks Related to the Bard AcquisitionCompletion of the Bard acquisition is subject to conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Bard acquisition will not be completed.The obligations of us and Bard to complete the Bard acquisition are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including approval of the Bard acquisition by the Bard stockholders, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period in connection with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), the receipt of any authorization or consent from certain other governmental authorities required to be obtained with respect to the merger under applicable foreign antitrust laws, the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with respect to shares of our common stock to be issued in the Bard acquisition, approval of the listing on the NYSE of shares of our common stock to be issued in the Bard acquisition, and the absence of an injunction prohibiting the Bard acquisition. Each party’s obligation to complete the Bard acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under applicable law) of certain other customary conditions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party under the Bard merger agreement (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the Bard merger agreement), the performance by the other party of its respective obligations under the Bard merger agreement in all material respects and delivery of officer certificates by the other party certifying satisfaction of the two preceding conditions. Either we or Bard may, subject to certain exceptions, terminate the Bard merger agreement upon mutual consent or if the Bard acquisition has not been consummated on or before January 23, 2018 (or before April 23, 2018 if all closing conditions have been satisfied other than the receipt of required competition approvals). The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the Bard acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. If the Bard acquisition is not completed, our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Bard acquisition, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:•the market price of our common stock could decline; •if the Bard merger agreement is terminated and our board of directors seeks another business combination, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that Bard has agreed to in the Bard merger agreement; •time and resources, financial and other, committed by our management to matters relating to the Bard acquisition could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities for our company; •we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers or employees; and•we will be required to pay our respective costs relating to the Bard acquisition, including legal, accounting, financial advisory, financing and printing fees, whether or not the Bard acquisition is completed.In addition, if the Bard acquisition is not completed, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Bard acquisition or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Bard merger agreement. The materialization of any of these risks could materially and adversely impact our ongoing business.Similarly, any delay in completing the Bard acquisition could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the Bard acquisition and cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Bard acquisition is successfully completed within its expected timeframe. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the Bard acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that the Bard acquisition will be consummated.In order to complete the Bard acquisition, we and Bard must make certain governmental filings and obtain certain governmental authorizations, and if such filings and authorizations are not made or granted or are granted with conditions, completion of the Bard acquisition may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the Bard acquisition could be reduced.Although we and Bard have agreed in the Bard merger agreement to use reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain governmental filings, to obtain the required expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and to obtain any authorization or consent from certain other governmental authorities required to be obtained with respect to the merger under applicable foreign antitrust laws, there can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained. As a condition to granting termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and to adoption of approvals of the 33Bard acquisition, governmental authorities may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after completion of the Bard acquisition.Under the terms of the Bard merger agreement, subject to certain exceptions, we and our subsidiaries are required to accept certain conditions and take certain actions imposed by certain governmental authorities that would apply to, or affect, the businesses, assets or properties of us, our subsidiaries or Bard and its subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of (i) delaying completion of the Bard acquisition, (ii) imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Bard acquisition, or (iii) otherwise adversely affecting our businesses and results of operations after completion of the Bard acquisition. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the Bard acquisition. Each party is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed merger is pending, which could adversely affect each party’s or the combined company’s business and operations.In connection with the pendency of the Bard acquisition, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we or Bard have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or Bard, as the case may be, as a result of the Bard acquisition, which could negatively affect our or Bard’s respective revenues, earnings and cash flows, regardless of whether the Bard acquisition is completed. If the Bard acquisition is completed, such terminations, changes or renegotiations could negatively affect the revenues, earnings and cash flows of the combined company. These risks may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the Bard acquisition.Risks Relating to the Combined Company After Completion of the Bard AcquisitionCombining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Bard acquisition may not be realized.We and Bard have operated and, until the completion of the Bard acquisition, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the Bard acquisition, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our business with the business of Bard. The Bard acquisition will involve the integration of Bard’s business with our existing business, which is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. It is possible that the pendency of the Bard acquisition and/or the integration process could result in material challenges, including, without limitation: •the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the devotion of management’s attention to the Bard acquisition; •managing a larger combined company; •maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; •the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; •retaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships;•consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations and inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; •coordinating geographically separate organizations; •unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; and •unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Bard acquisition.Many of these factors will be outside of the combined company’s control and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially affect the combined company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Bard acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on (i) each of us and Bard during this transition period and (ii) the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of the Bard acquisition. In addition, the actual cost savings of the Bard acquisition could be less than anticipated.In addition, certain risks associated with our industry and business described herein and in our public filings may become more significant following consummation of the Bard acquisition, including, but not limited to, risks relating to: the continued focus by third-party payors on cost containment and government scrutiny of the healthcare industry’s sales and 34marketing practices, various healthcare reform proposals that have emerged on the federal and state levels and in other jurisdictions where the combined company sells its products, collective bargaining and labor activity and the integrity of our information systems that are run by third party vendors and such vendors’ ability to maintain their systems and reduce any vulnerability to natural and system disruptions and prevent cyber-attacks and other unauthorized access.The future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the completion of the Bard acquisition.Following the completion of the Bard acquisition, the size of the combined company’s business will be significantly larger than the current size of either our or Bard’s respective businesses. The combined company’s ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend, in part, upon management’s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two discrete companies, but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the Bard acquisition.The combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the Bard acquisition and the integration of BD and Bard.We and Bard have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Bard acquisition and combining the operations of the two companies. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will be comprised of transaction and regulatory costs related to the Bard acquisition.We also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the Bard acquisition and the integration of the two companies’ businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.In connection with the Bard acquisition, we will incur significant additional indebtedness, and certain of Bard’s indebtedness will remain outstanding, which could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility, and will increase our interest expense.Our consolidated indebtedness as of March 31, 2017 was approximately $10.3 billion. We will have substantially increased indebtedness following completion of the Bard acquisition, including the incurrence of new indebtedness to finance the Bard acquisition and assumption of Bard’s existing indebtedness, in comparison to our indebtedness on a recent historical basis, which could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing our interest expense. The amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the Bard acquisition, and thus the demands on our cash resources, will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the Bard acquisition. The increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the Bard acquisition could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness as it becomes due and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. In addition, certain of the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the Bard acquisition may bear interest at variable interest rates. If interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could further adversely affect our cash flows. If we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the Bard acquisition, or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations, then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.In addition, our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. In connection with the debt financing for the Bard acquisition, it is anticipated that we will seek ratings of our indebtedness from one or more nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. There can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future or that we will be able to maintain our current rating. Furthermore, we expect that our combined company’s credit ratings will be lower following the Bard acquisition, including below “investment grade” by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., which may further increase the combined company’s future borrowing costs and reduce the combined company’s access to capital.35Moreover, in the future we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. Our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all.We may not be able to service all of the combined company’s indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. Our failure to meet our debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments. We expect to be able to meet the estimated cash interest payments on the combined company’s debt following the Bard acquisition through a combination of the expected cash flows from operations of the combined company. However, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations of the combined company and to utilize other methods to make scheduled payments will depend on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. There can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional capital, sell assets or refinance our indebtedness. Any such action may not be successful and we may be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the Bard acquisition may contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that may affect our ability to operate our businesses.The agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the Bard acquisition may contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, have liens on our property, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person, engage in certain transactions with affiliates and change the nature of our business. In addition, the agreements may also require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including financial ratios. The ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations.Uncertainties associated with the Bard acquisition may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees of Bard or us, which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company following the Bard acquisition.We and Bard are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our respective officers and other key employees to execute our respective business plans. The combined company’s success after the Bard acquisition will depend in part upon its ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of us and Bard. Current and prospective employees of us and Bard may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the Bard acquisition, which may materially adversely affect the ability of each of us and Bard to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of and after the Bard acquisition. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees of us and Bard.Completion of the Bard acquisition will trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Bard is a party, which may have an adverse impact on the combined company’s business and results of operations.The completion of the Bard acquisition will trigger change in control and other provisions in certain agreements to which Bard is a party. If we and Bard are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if we and Bard are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Bard or the combined company. Any of the foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on the combined company’s business and results of operations. For example, if the ratings of certain of Bard’s outstanding senior notes are reduced beyond certain thresholds within certain time periods prior to or following the consummation of the Bard acquisition, Bard could be required to offer to 36repurchase such notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.Following the consummation of the Bard acquisition, the combined company will assume certain potential liabilities relating to Bard, including certain products liability and mass torts claims.Following the consummation of the Bard acquisition, the combined company will have assumed certain potential liabilities relating to Bard, including certain products liability and mass tort claims with respect to the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices and related settlement agreements and judgements. Such claims include Hernia Product Claims, Women’s Health Product Claims, Filter Product Claims and other claims. As of March 31, 2017, Bard has reported that there are: (i) approximately 25 federal and 80 state lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 105 plaintiffs, as well as one putative class action in the United States, are currently pending against Bard with respect to the Hernia Product Claims, (ii) product liability lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 5,305 plaintiffs are currently pending against Bard in various federal and state jurisdictions with respect to the Women’s Health Product Claims and (iii) product liability lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 1,755 plaintiffs are currently pending against Bard in various federal and state jurisdictions with respect to the Filter Product Claims.Bard does not maintain or has limited remaining insurance coverage for certain of these claims and the combined company may not be able to obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms or at all that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Moreover, in some circumstances adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture, quality or marketing of our combined company’s products could result in the FDA suspending or delaying its review of our applications for new product approvals, or imposing post market approval requirements. In addition, reserves established by Bard or the combined company for estimated losses, including with respect to these claims, do not represent an exact calculation of actual liability but instead represent estimates of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates, additional reserves may be established from time-to-time, and actual losses relating to the assumed Bard liabilities may be materially higher or lower than the related reserve. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockFuture sales and issuances of our shares of common stock could reduce the market price of our shares of common stock.We will issue a significant number of shares of our common stock in connection with the Bard acquisition. Many Bard stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of our common stock they will receive in the Bard acquisition. Other Bard stockholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of our common stock that they receive in the Bard acquisition. Such sales of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock and may take place promptly following the Bard acquisition.In addition, we expect to issue a significant amount of equity and equity-linked securities to finance a portion of the Bard acquisition. To the extent we issue equity or equity-linked securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by:•investors’ anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock, including common stock received upon conversion of any equity-linked securities;•possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the equity-linked securities as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock; and•hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving the equity or equity-linked securities.Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.37Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
