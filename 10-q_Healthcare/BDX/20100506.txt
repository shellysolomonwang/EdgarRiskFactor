Item 1A. Risk Factors  There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2009 fiscal year, except as provided below:  Recently enacted federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”) was enacted in March 2010. Under the PPACA, beginning in 2013, medical device manufacturers, such as BD, will pay a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices. We can not predict with any certainty what other impact the PPACA may have on our business. The PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals, clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies, and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures. These factors, in turn, could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure. It is also possible that the PPACA will result in lower reimbursements for our products. While the PPACA is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the U.S., the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of BD’s products is uncertain at this time.
