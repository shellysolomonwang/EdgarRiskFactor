Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K.        •    Continued weakness in the global economy and financial markets, and the potential adverse effect on the cost of operating our business, the demand for our products and services, prices for our products and services due to increases in pricing pressure, or our ability to produce our products, including the impact on developing countries. In particular, deficit reduction efforts or other adverse changes in the availability of government funding for healthcare and research, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, could further weaken demand for our products and result in additional pricing pressures, as well as create potential collection risks associated with such sales. In that regard, in the U.S., automatic spending cuts, or sequestration, that could affect government healthcare spending and research funding are set to go into effect in the absence of further legislative action.        •    The consequences of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the United States, which implemented an excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices, and which could result in reduced demand for our products, increased pricing pressures or otherwise adversely affect BD’s business.        •    Future healthcare reform in the countries in which we do business may also involve changes in government pricing and reimbursement policies or other cost containment reforms.        •    Changes in domestic and foreign healthcare industry practices that result in a reduction in procedures using our products or increased pricing pressures, including the continued consolidation among healthcare providers and trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment (including changes in reimbursement practices by third party payors).        •    Our ability to penetrate developing and emerging markets, which depends on local economic and political conditions and how well we are able to acquire or form strategic business alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and technology.    32    Table of Contents     •    Regional, national and foreign economic factors, including inflation, deflation, fluctuations in interest rates and, in particular, foreign currency exchange rates, and the potential effect on our revenues, expenses, margins and credit ratings.        •    New or changing laws and regulations affecting our domestic and foreign operations, or changes in enforcement practices, including laws relating to trade, monetary and fiscal policies, taxation (including tax reforms that could adversely impact multinational corporations), sales practices, price controls and licensing and regulatory requirements for new products and products in the postmarketing phase. In particular, the U.S. and other countries may impose new requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products. Environmental laws, particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD.        •    Product efficacy or safety concerns regarding our products resulting in product recalls, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or foreign counterparts, declining sales and product liability claims, particularly in light of the current regulatory environment, including increased enforcement activity by the FDA.        •    Competitive factors that could adversely affect our operations, including new product introductions (for example, new forms of drug delivery) by our current or future competitors, increased pricing pressure due to the impact of low-cost manufacturers as certain competitors have established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers in low-cost manufacturing locations as a means to lower their costs, patents attained by competitors (particularly as patents on our products expire), and new entrants into our markets.        •    The effects of events that adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products (particularly where production of a product line is concentrated in one or more plants) or our ability to source materials or components from suppliers that are needed for such manufacturing, including pandemics, natural disasters, or environmental factors.        •    Fluctuations in the cost and availability of oil-based resins and other raw materials, as well as certain sub-assemblies and finished goods, the ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships (particularly with respect to sole-source suppliers), and the potential adverse effects of any disruption in the availability of such items.        •    Difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and abroad, obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for new products, or gain and maintain market approval of products, as well as the possibility of infringement claims by competitors with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights, all of which can preclude or delay commercialization of a product. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or clearances from the FDA or other    33    Table of Contents       regulatory agencies or changes in the regulatory process (including potential 510(k) reforms) may also delay product launches and increase development costs.        •    Fluctuations in the demand for products we sell to pharmaceutical companies that are used to manufacture, or are sold with, the products of such companies, as a result of funding constraints, consolidation or otherwise.        •    Fluctuations in university or U.S. and international governmental funding and policies for life sciences research.        •    Our ability to achieve our projected level or mix of product sales, as our earnings forecasts are based on projected volumes and sales of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others.        •    Our ability to implement our ongoing upgrade of our enterprise resource planning system, as any delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our upgrade could adversely affect our business.        •    Security breaches of our computer and communications systems, including computer viruses, “hacking” and “cyber-attacks,” which could impair our ability to conduct business, or result in the loss of BD trade secrets or otherwise compromise sensitive information of BD or its customers, suppliers and other business partners.        •    Pending and potential future litigation or other proceedings adverse to BD, including antitrust claims, product liability claims and patent infringement claims, and the availability or collectability of insurance relating to any such claims.        •    The effect of adverse media exposure or other publicity regarding BD’s business or operations, including the effect on BD’s reputation or demand for its products.        •    The effects, if any, of governmental and media activities regarding the business practices of group purchasing organizations, which negotiate product prices on behalf of their member hospitals with BD and other suppliers.        •    The effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in BD’s pension plans and on actuarial interest rate and asset return assumptions, which could require BD to make additional contributions to the plans or increase our pension plan expense.        •    Political conditions in international markets, including civil unrest, terrorist activity, governmental changes, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders and expropriation of assets by a government, including the recent civil unrest in parts of the Middle East.        •    The impact of business combinations, including any volatility in earnings relating to acquired in-process research and development assets, and our ability to successfully integrate any business we may acquire.    34    Table of Contents     •    Our ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs, if any, that we may undertake.        •    Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.    35    Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  There have been no material changes in information reported since the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012.  Item 4. Controls and Procedures  An evaluation was carried out by BD’s management, with the participation of BD’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of BD’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2012. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were, as of the end of the period covered by this report, effective and designed to ensure that material information relating to BD and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within these entities. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2012 identified in connection with the above-referenced evaluation that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, BD’s internal control over financial reporting.    36    Table of Contents PART II—OTHER INFORMATION  Item 1. Legal Proceedings  We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business, including product liability and environmental matters as set forth in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Since September 30, 2012, the following developments have occurred with respect to the legal proceedings in which we are involved:  Antitrust Class Actions  The District Court preliminarily approved the $45 million settlement with the direct purchasers. A hearing has been scheduled before the District Court for March 2013 to rule on final approval of the $45 million settlement.  Retractable Technologies, Inc. (“RTI”)  In January 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court denied RTI’s petition for review of the ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that BD’s 3ml BD Integra™ products did not infringe the asserted RTI patents. No date has been set yet for the trial on RTI’s antitrust and false advertising claims.  Gen-Probe  As previously reported, on December 1, 2012, BD entered into a settlement agreement with Gen-Probe in the action before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, under which the Company is granted a license to make, use and sell products accused of infringing Gen-Probe patents in the action. The payments that BD will make to Gen-Probe under the settlement, which include a settlement payment, a licensing fee and ongoing royalties, are not material to BD’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows. Following the settlement, the case was dismissed with prejudice.  Summary  Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, BD is not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which BD is a party. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, BD establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). In view of the uncertainties discussed above, BD could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BD’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows.    37    Table of Contents Item 1A.
