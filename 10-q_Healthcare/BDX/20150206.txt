Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.        •   Weakness in the global economy and financial markets, and the potential adverse effect on the cost of operating our business, the demand for our products and services, the prices for our products and services due to increases in pricing pressure, or our ability to produce our products, including the impact on developing countries.        •   Deficit reduction efforts or other adverse changes in the availability of government funding for healthcare and research, particularly in the United States and Europe, that could further weaken demand for our products and result in additional pricing pressures, as well as create potential collection risks associated with such sales.        •   The consequences of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the United States, which implemented an excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices, and which could result in reduced demand for our products, increased pricing pressures or otherwise adversely affect BD’s business.        •   Future healthcare reform in the countries in which we do business that may involve changes in government pricing and reimbursement policies or other cost containment reforms.        •   Changes in domestic and foreign healthcare industry practices that result in a reduction in procedures using our products or increased pricing pressures, including the continued consolidation among healthcare providers and trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. For example, changes to guidelines providing for increased cervical cancer screening intervals has and may continue to negatively impact sales of our Women’s Health and Cancer platform.        •   Changes in reimbursement practices of third-party payers.        •   Our ability to penetrate emerging markets, which depends on local economic and political conditions, and how well we are able to acquire or form strategic business alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities and distribution networks. Our international operations also increase our compliance risks, including risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws.        •   Political conditions in international markets, including civil unrest, terrorist activity, governmental changes, trade barriers, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders and expropriation of assets by a government.        •   Security breaches of our computer and communications systems, including computer viruses, “hacking” and “cyber-attacks,” which could impair our ability to conduct business, or result in the loss of BD trade secrets or otherwise compromise sensitive information of BD or its customers, suppliers and other business partners.        •   Fluctuations in the cost and availability of oil-based resins and other raw materials, as well as certain components, the ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships (particularly with respect to sole-source suppliers), and the potential adverse effects of any disruption in the availability of such items.    29    Table of Contents     •   Regional, national and foreign economic factors, including inflation, deflation, fluctuations in interest rates and, in particular, foreign currency exchange rates, and the potential effect on our revenues, expenses, margins and credit ratings.        •   New or changing laws and regulations affecting our domestic and foreign operations, or changes in enforcement practices, including laws relating to trade, monetary and fiscal policies, taxation (including tax reforms that could adversely impact multinational corporations), sales practices, environmental protection, price controls and licensing and regulatory requirements for new products and products in the postmarketing phase. In particular, the U.S. and other countries may impose new requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products. Environmental laws, particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD.        •   Product efficacy or safety concerns regarding our products resulting in product recalls, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or foreign counterparts, declining sales and product liability claims, particularly in light of the current regulatory environment, including increased enforcement activity by the FDA.        •   Competitive factors that could adversely affect our operations, including new product introductions (for example, new forms of drug delivery) by our current or future competitors, increased pricing pressure due to the impact of low-cost manufacturers as certain competitors have established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers in low-cost manufacturing locations as a means to lower their costs, patents attained by competitors (particularly as patents on our products expire), and new entrants into our markets.        •   The effects of events that adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products (particularly where production of a product line is concentrated in one or more plants) or our ability to source materials or components from suppliers (including sole-source suppliers) that are needed for such manufacturing, including pandemics, natural disasters, or environmental factors.        •   Difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and abroad, obtain intellectual property protection for our products, obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for new products, or gain and maintain market approval of products, as well as the possibility of infringement claims by competitors with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights, all of which can preclude or delay commercialization of a product. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or clearances from the FDA or other regulatory agencies or changes in the regulatory process may also delay product launches and increase development costs.        •   Fluctuations in the demand for products we sell to pharmaceutical companies that are used to manufacture, or are sold with, the products of such companies, as a result of funding constraints, consolidation or otherwise.        •   Fluctuations in university or U.S. and international governmental funding and policies for life sciences research.    30    Table of Contents     •   Our ability to achieve our projected level or mix of product sales, as our earnings forecasts are based on projected sales volumes and pricing of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others.        •   Our ability to complete the implementation of our ongoing upgrade of our enterprise resource planning system, as any delays or deficiencies in completing the implementation could adversely affect our business.        •   Pending and potential future litigation or other proceedings adverse to BD, including antitrust, product liability, environmental and patent infringement, and the availability or collectability of insurance relating to any such claims.        •   The effect of adverse media exposure or other publicity regarding BD’s business or operations, including the effect on BD’s reputation or demand for its products.        •   The effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in BD’s pension plans and on actuarial interest rate and asset return assumptions, which could require BD to make additional contributions to the plans or increase our pension plan expense.        •   The impact of business combinations, including any volatility in earnings relating to acquired in-process research and development assets, and our ability to successfully integrate any business we may acquire.        •   Our ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs, if any, that we may undertake.        •   Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission.        •   Risk related to our pending acquisition of CareFusion including,        •   The failure to satisfy the conditions to completing the transaction, including obtaining required regulatory approvals.        •   Conditions to obtaining regulatory approval that may place restrictions on the business of the combined company.        •   Our failure to obtain the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the acquisition.        •   The impact of the additional debt we will incur to finance the acquisition.  The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.    31    Table of Contents   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  There have been no material changes in information reported since the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014.      Item 4. Controls and Procedures  An evaluation was carried out by BD’s management, with the participation of BD’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of BD’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2014. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were, as of the end of the period covered by this report, effective and designed to ensure that material information relating to BD and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within these entities. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2014 identified in connection with the above-referenced evaluation that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, BD’s internal control over financial reporting.    32    Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1. Legal Proceedings  We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business, including product liability and environmental matters as set forth in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Since September 30, 2014, the following developments have occurred with respect to the legal proceedings in which we are involved:  Retractable Technologies  Patent Infringement Action  On July 7, 2014, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the November 9, 2009 District Court ruling that awarded Retractable Technologies, Inc. $5 million in damages for patent infringement. On January 16, 2015, BD filed a petition for U.S. Supreme Court review of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals decision leaving the damages award intact.  Antitrust and False Advertising Action  On January 14, 2015, the Court granted in part and denied in part BD’s motion for a stay of the injunction that had been entered by the Court. The Court held that, pending appeal, BD would be not be required to send the corrective advertising notices to end-user customers, but only to employees, distributors and Group Purchasing Organizations. The Court otherwise upheld its November 10, 2014 Order regarding the injunction. On January 15, 2015, the Court entered its Final Judgment in the case. In the Final Judgment, the Court ordered that RTI recovers $341 million for its attempted monopolization claim and $12 million for attorneys’ fees, and awarded pre and post-judgment interest and costs. On February 3, 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied BD’s motion for a stay of the injunction pending the final appeal. BD intends to file a post-judgment motion to the district court and expects that the motion will include a challenge to that court’s award of pre-judgment interest, which had not been requested in any pleading prior to the entry of Final Judgment. BD also intends to file an appeal to the Court of Appeals challenging the entirety of the Final Judgment.  CareFusion Shareholder Litigation  On December 30, 2014, the parties to the actions filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Delaware Actions”) entered into an agreement in principle to settle the Delaware Actions on the basis of additional disclosures made in a CareFusion Schedule 14A, filed with the SEC on January 5, 2015. The settlement terms are reflected in a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”). On December 31, 2014, plaintiffs’ counsel notified the Delaware Court of Chancery of the settlement and MOU. Pursuant to the MOU, the parties to the Delaware Actions have agreed to negotiate in good faith to execute a stipulation of settlement, and will present the proposed settlement to the Delaware Court of Chancery as soon as practicable. The actions filed in the Superior Court of California are not part of the proposed settlement and are still pending.  Summary  Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, BD is not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which BD is a party. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, BD establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). In view of the uncertainties discussed above, BD could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BD’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows.    33    Table of Contents   Item 1A. Risk Factors  Except as discussed in Part I, Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, and in Part II, Item 1 “Legal Proceedings”, there have been no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
