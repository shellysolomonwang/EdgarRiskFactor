Item 1A Risk Factors  The discussion of our business and operations should be read together with the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, which was filed with the SEC and describes the various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. At March 31, 2013, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012, except for the following: Government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products, which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products. Our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can, without notice, deny coverage for treatments that may include the use of our products. Therefore, even if a product is approved for marketing, we cannot make assurances that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product, that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount, even if initially adequate, will not be subsequently reduced. For example, in some markets, such as Spain, France and Germany, government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In other markets, such as Australia, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat SDB conditions. As we continue to develop new products, those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement until they are approved for marketing, if at all.  In the United States, we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers, hospitals and to sleep clinics. Reductions in reimbursement to our customers by third-party payers, if they occur, may have a material impact on our customers and, therefore, may indirectly affect our sales to, or the collectability of receivables we have from, those customers. A recent development affecting reimbursement negatively stems from the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, which instructed the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, to establish and implement programs under which our customers who provide home healthcare services must compete to offer products in designated competitive bidding areas, or CBAs. CMS recently rolled out the competitive bidding program in 9 CBAs and included home medical equipment such as oxygen and oxygen equipment, CPAP and respiratory assist devices, and related supplies and accessories. On July 2, 2010, CMS announced the single payment amount – the amount paid to successful bidders –for the first round of the competitive bidding and began offering contracts to qualifying home health companies, effective January 1, 2011. The average reduction from current Medicare payment rates in this first round of competitive bidding was approximately 32% overall and 34% for CPAP and respiratory devices and became effective January 1, 2011.

AND SUBSIDIARIES      Item 1A Risk Factors, Continued     CMS announced the single payment amounts for the second round, which cover a total of 91 CBAs. For CPAP and respiratory devices, the average reduction from current Medicare payment rates in the second round was approximately 47% on a weighted average basis, effective July 1, 2013. By 2016, the competitive bidding process must either be nationalized or CMS must reduce Medicare prices in non-competitive bidding areas to match competitive bidding prices. We cannot predict at this time what impact, if any, these changes to the competitive bidding program will have on our business and financial condition.
