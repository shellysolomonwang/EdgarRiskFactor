AND SUBSIDIARIES     ﻿   We have made certain assumptions relating to our recent acquisitions that may prove to be materially inaccurate. We have made certain assumptions relating to our recent acquisitions, including of MatrixCare, such as:     ·    projections of each acquired company’s future revenue;    ·    the amount of goodwill and intangibles that will result from our acquisitions;    ·    acquisition costs, including transaction, contingent consideration and integration costs; and    ·    other financial and strategic rationales and risks of the acquisitions.  ﻿   While management has made such assumptions in good faith and believes them to be reasonable, the assumptions may turn out to be materially inaccurate, including for reasons beyond our control. If these assumptions are incorrect we may change or modify our assumptions, and such change or modification could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.   ﻿   Prior to our recent acquisitions, those companies were privately-held, and their new obligations of being a part of a public company may require significant resources and management attention. Upon consummation of our recent acquisitions, the acquired entities became subsidiaries of our consolidated company, and need to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. We will need to ensure that each of the acquired companies establishes and maintains effective disclosure controls as well as internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, and such compliance efforts may be costly and may divert the attention of management.    ﻿   Item 2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
