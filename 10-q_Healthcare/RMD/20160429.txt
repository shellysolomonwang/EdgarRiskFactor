Item 1A Risk Factors  The discussion of our business and operations should be read together with the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and our quarterly report for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2015, which were filed with the SEC and describe the various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. As of March 31, 2016, there have been no further material changes to such risk factors with the exception of the following:  Our leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business. In connection with our acquisition of Brightree LLC, in April 2016, our total consolidated debt is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:          •   making it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations;     •   increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions;     •   limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;     •   limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and     •   exposing us to greater interest rate risk.    27    Table of Contents       PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1-6   RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal in indebtedness, which could impede our growth. Our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness, and to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
