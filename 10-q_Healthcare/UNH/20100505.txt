Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part II of this Form 10-Q.  Adverse Economic Conditions. The current U.S. recessionary economic environment has impacted demand for some of our products and services. For example, decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our employer customers, putting pressure on top line growth for our UnitedHealthcare and OptumHealth businesses. This workplace attrition will continue to impact UnitedHealthcare’s commercial risk and fee-based membership in 2010, and this is expected to continue until national employment stabilizes. In contrast, our AmeriChoice business is experiencing growth in its state Medicaid offerings as employment rates fall. If the recessionary economic environment continues for a prolonged period, federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate and/or impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments. Our revenues are also impacted by U.S. monetary and fiscal policy. In response to recessionary conditions, the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained the target federal funds rate at a range of zero to 25 basis points.  In general, we believe that economic recessions could impact our revenue growth rate and our operating profitability. We also believe that government funding pressure, coupled with recessionary economic conditions, will impact the financial positions of hospitals, physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses. For additional discussions regarding how the adverse economic conditions could affect our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of our 2009 10-K.  Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. The Paul Wellstone-Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act 2008 (Mental Health Parity Act) became effective for plan years beginning on or after October 3, 2009 and requires that financial requirements and treatment limitations applicable to mental health or substance abuse benefits be no more restrictive than those imposed on medical and surgical benefits. The Mental Health Parity Act does not require plans to offer mental health or substance abuse benefits. The Federal Mental Health Parity Act Interim Final Regulations were released in February 2010 with an effective date as early as July 1, 2010 for some plans. Based on our current interpretations of the regulatory changes, we expect to see some impacts to risk-based behavioral health benefit costs beginning in 2011. Based on our renewal cycle, we believe the impact on our 2010 results of operations will not be material. We anticipate pricing actions in 2011 may mitigate the impact of revised regulations.    31    Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY                        (in millions, except percentages and per share data)   Three Months Ended March 31,     Increase (Decrease)       2010       2009      2010 vs. 2009     Revenues:                      Premiums   $  21,128     $  20,111     $  1,017     5 %    Services     1,364       1,296       68     5     Products     528       439       89     20     Investment and other income     173       158       15     9                                     Total revenues     23,193       22,004       1,189     5                                     Operating costs:                      Medical costs     17,170       16,570       600     4     Medical care ratio     81.3 %      82.4 %         (1.1 )    Operating costs     3,276       3,128       148     5     Operating cost ratio     14.1 %      14.2 %         (0.1 )    Cost of products sold     483       404       79     20     Depreciation and amortization     248       234       14     6                                     Total operating costs     21,177       20,336       841     4                                     Earnings from operations     2,016       1,668       348     21     Operating margin     8.7 %      7.6 %         1.1     Interest expense     (125 )      (131 )      6     5                                     Earnings before income taxes     1,891       1,537       354     23     Provision for income taxes     (700 )      (553 )      (147 )    (27 )    Tax rate     37.0 %      36.0 %         1.0                                     Net earnings   $ 1,191     $ 984     $ 207     21 %                                    Diluted net earnings per common share   $ 1.03     $ 0.81     $ 0.22     27 %    Return on equity     19.9 %      18.7 %         1.2 %  2010 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2009 RESULTS  Consolidated Financial Results  Revenues  The increases in revenues in the first quarter of 2010 were primarily due to strong organic growth in risk-based offerings in our public and senior markets businesses, commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends and growth in public sector specialty benefit offerings and health care technology software and services, partially offset by decreases in our commercial membership.  Medical Costs  Medical costs in the first quarter of 2010 increased primarily due to growth in our public and senior markets risk-based businesses, which was partially offset by overall net favorable development in prior period medical costs.  For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, there was $490 million and $200 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The 2010 favorable development was primarily driven by changes in previous estimates related to more efficient claims handling and processing,    32    Table of Contents  resulting in higher completion factors, lower than expected health system utilization levels, the H1N1 influenza outbreak being less costly than had been estimated and the mix effect of longer duration state Medicaid members who have a more favorable health status.  Operating Costs  Operating costs for the first quarter of 2010 increased due to acquired and organic business growth, partially offset by ongoing cost management and quality improvements.  Income Tax Rate  The increase in our effective income tax rate in 2010 resulted primarily from limitations on the future deductibility of certain compensation related to the Health Reform Legislation, which was signed into law during the first quarter of 2010.  Reporting Segments  We have four reporting segments:        •    Health Benefits, which includes UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice;        •    OptumHealth;        •    Ingenix; and        •    Prescription Solutions.  See Note 11 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the types and services from which each of these reporting segments derives its revenues.  Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Benefits customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Benefits customers by OptumHealth, and consulting and other services sold to Health Benefits by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation.    33    Table of Contents The following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments:                        (in millions, except percentages)   Three Months Ended March 31,     Increase (Decrease)      2010     2009     2010 vs. 2009     Revenues                      Health Benefits   $ 21,637     $ 20,672     $ 965     5 %    OptumHealth     1,417       1,332       85     6     Ingenix     505       385       120     31     Prescription Solutions     4,096       3,539       557     16     Eliminations     (4,462 )      (3,924 )      (538 )    nm                                     Consolidated revenues   $  23,193     $  22,004     $  1,189     5 %                                    Earnings from operations                      Health Benefits   $ 1,682     $ 1,321     $ 361     27 %    OptumHealth     151       158       (7 )    (4 )    Ingenix     53       49       4     8     Prescription Solutions     130       140       (10 )    (7 )                                    Consolidated earnings from operations   $ 2,016     $ 1,668     $ 348     21 %                                    Operating margin                      Health Benefits     7.8 %      6.4 %         1.4 %    OptumHealth     10.7       11.9          (1.2 )    Ingenix     10.5       12.7          (2.2 )    Prescription Solutions     3.2       4.0          (0.8 )                                 Consolidated operating margin     8.7 %      7.6 %         1.1 %                               nm = not meaningful  The following summarizes the number of individuals served by our Health Benefits businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of March 31, 2010 and 2009:                          Increase (Decrease)     (in thousands, except percentages)   2010   2009   2010 vs. 2009     Commercial risk-based   9,140   9,915   (775 )    (8 )%    Commercial fee-based   15,380   15,525   (145 )    (1 )                          Total commercial   24,520   25,440   (920 )    (4 )                          Medicare Advantage   2,005   1,695   310     18     Medicaid   3,045   2,695   350     13     Standardized Medicare Supplement   2,715   2,600   115     4                           Total public and senior   7,765   6,990   775     11                           Total Health Benefits   32,285   32,430   (145 )    (0 )%                        Health Benefits  The revenue growth in Health Benefits for the three months ended March 31, 2010 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends, partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products, principally reflecting the decline in U.S. employment, and Medicare Advantage premium rate decreases. For the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, revenues were $10.0 billion and $10.3 billion for UnitedHealthcare; $9.3 billion and $8.4 billion for Ovations; and $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion for AmeriChoice, respectively.    34    Table of Contents Health Benefits earnings from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010 increased $361 million or 27% over the prior year primarily due to factors that increased revenues described above as well as the effect of increased net favorable development in prior period medical costs.  OptumHealth  Increased revenues in OptumHealth for the three months ended March 31, 2010 were driven by new business development in large scale public sector programs and increased sales of benefits and services to external employer markets, partially offset by a decline in revenues associated with a decrease in UnitedHealthcare commercial membership. As of March 31, 2010, OptumHealth provided services to approximately 62 million consumers as compared to 58 million as of March 31, 2009.  Earnings from operations and operating margins for the three months ended March 31, 2010 decreased due to the loss of higher margin UnitedHealthcare risk-based business with earnings growth from expanding services in the public sector and external employer markets partially offsetting the decline in earnings from operations.  Ingenix  Increased revenues in Ingenix for the three months ended March 31, 2010 were primarily due to the impact of 2009 acquisitions and growth in information technology services and payment cycle management services. The decrease in operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2010 was primarily due to increases in the mix of lower margin services businesses, continued pressure in the pharmaceutical services business and investments in new growth areas.  Prescription Solutions  The increased Prescription Solutions revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2010 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our Ovations business. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $3.6 billion and $3.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Prescription Solutions earnings from operations and operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2010 decreased primarily due to changes in performance-based pricing contracts with Medicare Part D plan sponsors, which were partially offset by prescription volume growth, gains in mail service drug fulfillment and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals.  LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Liquidity  Introduction   We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before depreciation, amortization and other non-cash expenses. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The diversity of our businesses, our geographic and customer diversity and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk-based businesses, which seek to match premium rate increases with future expected medical costs, partially mitigates the risk of rising medical and operating costs.  Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash    35    Table of Contents  flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. We make these investments pursuant to our Board of Directors’ approved investment policy, which focuses on preservation of capital, credit quality, diversification, income and duration. The policy also generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations, tax implications and risk tolerances.  Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by NAIC. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval.  In 2010, based on the 2009 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that can be paid is $3.2 billion. For the three months ended March 31, 2010, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies ordinary dividends of $460 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $2.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. The total dividends included all of the ordinary capacity of $3.1 billion. In some cases, ordinary dividends were reclassified as extraordinary dividends due to their increased size and/or accelerated timing. Given current statutory capital levels, we anticipate lower overall regulated subsidiary dividends in 2010 as compared to 2009.  Our non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, as well as the availability of our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, expanding our services through business acquisitions, repaying debt and/or repurchasing shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions.    36    Table of Contents Results  A summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below:                    Three Months EndedMarch 31.     (in millions)   2010     2009     Sources of cash:             Cash provided by operating activities   $  1,205     $  1,112     Sales of investments     960       1,349     Maturities of investments     740       757     Interest rate swap termination     0       513     Customer funds administered     898       621     Other     327       201                       Total sources of cash     4,130       4,553                       Uses of cash:             Purchases of investments     (2,073 )      (2,102 )    Retirement of long-term debt     (833 )      (900 )    Common stock repurchases     (626 )      (689 )    Other     (478 )      (401 )                      Total uses of cash     (4,010 )      (4,092 )                      Net increase in cash   $  120     $  461                     2010 Cash Flows Compared to 2009 Cash Flows  First quarter cash flows from operating activities increased $93 million, or 8%, in 2010. Factors that improved cash flows from operating activities were growth in net earnings and related income tax accruals and the timing of prescription rebate receipts. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from operations related to the change in medical costs payable due to the acceleration of the payment cycle associated with the Medicare Part D program, as well as the timing of other medical claim payments. Cash flows used for investing activities increased $427 million, or 274%, primarily due to decreases in sales of investments.  Financial Condition  As of March 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $24.7 billion included $9.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.9 billion was held by non-regulated entities), $14.2 billion of debt securities and $602 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 equity securities, may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our $2.5 billion bank credit facility, reduce the need to sell investments in adverse markets. See Note 3 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements.  Our investment portfolio has a weighted-average duration of 2.2 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of March 31, 2010. Included in the debt securities balance were $2.9 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by third parties. A number of different guarantors guarantee the securities, and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct    37    Table of Contents  through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is “AA” as of March 31, 2010.  Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity  In addition to cash flow from operations and significant cash and cash equivalent balances at our regulated and unregulated entities, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:  Commercial Paper. We maintain a commercial paper program, which facilitates the issuance of senior unsecured debt sold on a discount basis with maturities of up to 270 days through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the $2.5 billion bank credit facility described below. We had $225 million of commercial paper outstanding as of March 31, 2010.  Bank Credit Facility. We have a $2.5 billion five-year revolving bank credit facility with 23 banks, which matures in May 2012. This facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of March 31, 2010. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on LIBOR plus a spread. As of March 31, 2010, the interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 0.4% to 0.7%.  Our bank credit facility contains various covenants, the most restrictive of which requires us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio below 50%. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio, calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders’ equity, was 30.2% and 32.1% as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of March 31, 2010.  Shelf Registration. In February 2008, we filed a universal S-3 shelf registration statement with the SEC registering an unspecified amount of debt securities.  Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at March 31, 2010 were as follows:                        Moody's   Standard & Poor's   Fitch      Ratings   Outlook   Ratings   Outlook   Ratings   Outlook   Senior unsecured debt   Baa1   Stable   A-   Negative   A-   Negative   Commercial paper   P-2   n/a   A-2   n/a   F1   n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have therefore adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital.  Debt Tender. In February 2010, we completed cash tender offers for $775 million in aggregate principal of certain of our outstanding fixed-rate notes to improve the matching of the interest rate exposure related to our floating rate assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We expect interest expense to be lower in 2010 as a result of the debt tender.  Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, subject to certain Board restrictions. In February 2010, the Board renewed and increased our share repurchase program, and authorized us to repurchase up to 120 million shares of our common stock. During the three months ended    38    Table of Contents  March 31, 2010, we repurchased 18.9 million shares at an average price of approximately $33 per share and an aggregate cost of $626 million. As of March 31, 2010, we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 105.2 million shares of our common stock.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2009 was disclosed in our 2009 10-K. During the three months ended March 31, 2010, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements” (ASU 2009-13). This update removes the criterion that entities must use objective and reliable evidence of fair value in separately accounting for deliverables and provides entities with a hierarchy of evidence that must be considered when allocating arrangement consideration. The new guidance also requires entities to allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on the deliverables’ relative selling price. The provisions will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in our fiscal year 2011 and must be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2009-13.  We have determined that all other recently issued accounting standards will not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, or do not apply to our operations.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  We prepared our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and trends and factor in known and projected trends. On an on-going basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates and this difference would be reported in our current operations.  For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of our 2009 10-K. As of March 31, 2010, our critical accounting policies have not changed from those described in our 2009 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2009 10-K.  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK  Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of March 31, 2010, we had an aggregate $2 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of    39    Table of Contents  the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as “A.” As of March 31, 2010, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this report include “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. Generally the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties and involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors.  Some factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include: the ultimate impact of the Health Reform Legislation, which could materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations through reduced revenues, increased costs, new taxes, expanded liability, changes to the ways in which we conduct business or putting us at risk for loss of business; our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs, including the impact of any new coverage requirements; the potential impact that new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement could have on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, including as a result of increases in medical, administrative, technology or other costs resulting from federal and state regulations affecting the health care industry; the potential impact of adverse economic conditions on our revenues (including decreases in enrollment resulting from increases in the unemployment rate and commercial attrition) and results of operations; regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures, which could affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share; uncertainties regarding changes in Medicare; potential reductions in revenue received from Medicare and Medicaid programs; our ability to execute contracts on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service professionals; our ability to attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent third-party brokers, consultants and agents; failure to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and data security regulations; events that may negatively affect our contracts with AARP; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with increased litigation; possible impairment of the value of our intangible assets if future results do not adequately support goodwill and intangible assets recorded for businesses that we acquire; increases in health care costs resulting from large-scale medical emergencies; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems; misappropriation of our proprietary technology; our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries to fund our obligations; failure to complete or receive anticipated benefits of acquisitions; potential downgrades in our credit ratings; and failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements, including savings resulting from technology enhancement and administrative modernization.  This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. We discuss certain of these matters more fully, as well as certain risk factors that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, in Part II, Item 1A, of this report and in our other periodic and current filings with the SEC, including our 2009 10-K. Any or all forward-looking statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements.    40    Table of Contents   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments.  As of March 31, 2010, $9.9 billion of our financial investments was classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $4.1 billion of our debt as of March 31, 2010 was at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.  The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of March 31, 2010, $14.4 billion of our investments was fixed-rate debt securities and $6.4 billion of our debt was fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.  We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices, as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we enter into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense. Our swap agreements converted a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments. Additional information on our derivative financial instruments is included in Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following table summarizes the impact of a hypothetical change in market interest rates by 1% or 2% as of March 31, 2010 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our financial investments and debt (in millions):                         Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate   InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a)     Interest ExpensePer Annum (a)     Fair Value ofFinancialInvestments     Fair Value ofDebt     2%   $  198     $  81     $  (1,104 )    $  (971 )    1%     99       41       (564 )      (523 )    (1)%     (15 )      (12 )      561       609     (2)%     nm       nm       1,113       1,324   nm = not meaningful      (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating rate assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2010, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 1% point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero.  As of March 31, 2010, we had $602 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were invested in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments.    41    Table of Contents   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In connection with the filing of this Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2010. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2010.  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    42    Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our 2009 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2009 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.  There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2009 10-K, except that we modified our risk factor relating to health care reform, as set forth below, due to enactment of the Health Reform Legislation.  The enactment or implementation of health care reforms could materially adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our revenues, financial position and results of operations.  In the first quarter of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as the Health Reform Legislation, were signed into law. The Health Reform Legislation enhances access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs and CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. Among other things, the Health Reform Legislation includes guaranteed coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded, establishes minimum medical cost ratios, imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits, reduces the Medicare Part D coverage gap and reduces payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage.  Provisions of the Health Reform Legislation become effective at various dates over the next several years. HHS, NAIC, the Department of Labor and the Treasury Department have yet to issue necessary enabling regulations and guidance with respect to the Health Reform Legislation. Due to the complexity of the Health Reform Legislation, including yet to be promulgated implementing regulations, lack of interpretive guidance and gradual implementation, the impact of the Health Reform Legislation is difficult to predict and not yet fully known.  For example, the Health Reform Legislation established minimum medical cost ratios for all commercial health plans in the large employer group, small employer group and individual markets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals), and companies with medical cost ratios below these targets will be required to rebate premiums to their customers annually. HHS has not yet promulgated rules addressing the appropriate measurement and application of these ratios. Depending on the results of the calculation and the manner in which we adjust our business model in light of this requirement, there could be meaningful disruptions in local health care markets, and our market share, revenues and results of operations could suffer a material adverse effect.  Several of the provisions in the Health Reform Legislation will likely increase our medical cost trends. Examples of these provisions are the excise tax on medical devices, annual fees on prescription drug manufacturers and the prohibition of pre-existing condition exclusions. The annual insurance industry assessment ($8 billion levied on the insurance industry in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter), which may not be deductible for income tax purposes, will increase our operating costs. Premium increases will be necessary to offset the impact these and other provisions will have on our medical and operating costs. These premium increases are oftentimes    43    Table of Contents  subject to state regulatory approval, and Congress is also considering additional health care reform measures that would subject all rate increases to a federal or state governmental pre-approval process. If we are not able to secure approval for premium increases to offset increases in our cost structure, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. For additional information regarding the Health Reform Legislation, see “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Executive Overview — Business Trends — Health Care Reforms.”  Congress is also considering additional health care reform measures, and a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets. The effects of the Health Reform Legislation and recently adopted state laws, and the regulations that have been and will be promulgated thereunder, are difficult to predict, and we cannot predict whether any other federal or state proposals will ultimately become law. Such laws and rules could force us to materially change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth in certain products and market segments, restrict premium growth rates for certain products and market segments, increase our medical and administrative costs and capital requirements, expose us to an increased risk of liability (including increasing our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations and contract interpretation) or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our results of operations, our market share, our financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill, and our cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes.
