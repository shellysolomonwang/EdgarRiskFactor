Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part II of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 (March 2010 10-Q).  Adverse Economic Conditions. The current U.S. recessionary economic environment has impacted demand for some of our products and services. For example, decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our employer customers, putting pressure on top line growth for our UnitedHealthcare and OptumHealth businesses. This workplace attrition will continue to impact UnitedHealthcare’s commercial risk and fee-based membership throughout 2010, and this is expected to continue until national employment stabilizes. In contrast, our AmeriChoice business is experiencing growth in its state Medicaid offerings as employment rates fall. If the recessionary economic environment continues for a prolonged period, federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate and/or impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments. Our revenues are also impacted by U.S. monetary and fiscal policy. In response to recessionary conditions, the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained the target federal funds rate at a range of zero to 25 basis points.  In general, we believe that economic recessions could impact our revenue growth rate and our operating profitability. We also believe that government funding pressure, coupled with recessionary economic conditions, will impact the financial positions of hospitals, physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses. For additional discussions regarding how the adverse economic conditions could affect our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of our 2009 10-K.  Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. The Paul Wellstone-Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act 2008 (Mental Health Parity Act) became effective for plan years beginning on or after October 3, 2009 and requires that financial requirements and treatment limitations applicable to mental health or substance abuse benefits be no more restrictive than those imposed on medical and surgical benefits. The Mental Health Parity Act does not require plans to offer mental health or substance abuse benefits. The Federal Mental Health Parity Act Interim Final Regulations were released in February 2010 with an effective date as early as July 1, 2010 for some plans. Based on our current interpretations of the regulatory changes, we expect to see some impacts to risk-based behavioral health benefit costs beginning in 2011. Based on our customer renewal cycle, we believe the impact on our 2010 results of operations will not be material. We anticipate pricing actions in 2011 will mitigate or partially mitigate the impact of revised regulations on our margins.    34    Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY                                          Three Months Ended June 30,     Six Months Ended June 30,     (in millions, except percentages and per share data)   2010     2009     Increase(Decrease) 2010 vs. 2009     2010     2009     Increase(Decrease) 2010 vs. 2009     Revenues:                                         Premiums   $ 21,125     $ 19,746     $ 1,379     7 %    $ 42,253     $ 39,857     $ 2,396     6 %    Services     1,413       1,307       106     8       2,777       2,603       174     7     Products     577       449       128     29       1,105       888       217     24     Investment and other income     149       153       (4 )    (3 )      322       311       11     4                                                                   Total revenues     23,264       21,655       1,609     7       46,457       43,659       2,798     6                                                                   Operating costs:                                         Medical costs     17,221       16,507       714     4       34,391       33,077       1,314     4     Medical care ratio     81.5 %      83.6 %         (2.1 )      81.4 %      83.0 %         (1.6 )    Operating costs     3,359       3,037       322     11       6,635       6,165       470     8     Operating cost ratio     14.4 %      14.0 %         0.4       14.3 %      14.1 %         0.2     Cost of products sold     534       422       112     27       1,017       826       191     23     Depreciation and amortization     249       249       0     0       497       483       14     3                                                                   Total operating costs     21,363       20,215       1,148     6       42,540       40,551       1,989     5                                                                   Earnings from operations     1,901       1,440       461     32       3,917       3,108       809     26     Operating margin     8.2 %      6.6 %         1.6       8.4 %      7.1 %         1.3     Interest expense     (119 )      (139 )      20     14       (244 )      (270 )      26     10                                                                   Earnings before income taxes     1,782       1,301       481     37       3,673       2,838       835     29     Provision for income taxes     (659 )      (442 )      (217 )    (49 )      (1,359 )      (995 )      (364 )    (37 )    Tax rate     37.0 %      34.0 %         3.0       37.0 %      35.1 %         1.9                                                                   Net earnings   $ 1,123     $ 859     $ 264     31 %    $ 2,314     $ 1,843     $ 471     26 %                                                                  Net margin     4.8 %      4.0 %         0.8 %      5.0 %      4.2 %         0.8 %    Diluted net earnings per common share   $ 0.99     $ 0.73     $ 0.26     36 %    $ 2.02     $ 1.54     $ 0.48     31 %    Return on equity     18.3 %      16.0 %         2.3 %      19.1 %      17.4 %         1.7 %  2010 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2009 RESULTS  Consolidated Financial Results  Revenues  The increases in revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 were primarily due to strong organic growth in risk-based benefit offerings in our public and senior markets businesses. Growth in customers served by our health services businesses, particularly through pharmaceutical benefit management programs, increasing revenues from public sector programs and health care technology software and services also contributed to our revenue growth.  Medical Costs  Medical costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 increased primarily due to growth in our public and senior markets risk-based businesses and medical cost inflation, which were partially offset by overall net favorable development of prior period medical costs and decreases in commercial membership.  For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period.    35    Table of Contents  For the three months ended June 30, 2010, there was $90 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years and $180 million of net favorable medical cost development related to the first quarter of 2010. For the six months ended June 30, 2010, medical costs included $580 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The favorable development for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 was primarily driven by changes in previous estimates related to more efficient claims handling and processing, resulting in higher completion factors and lower than expected health system utilization levels.  For the three months ended June 30, 2009, there was no net medical cost development related to prior fiscal years and $30 million of net favorable medical cost development related to the first quarter of 2009. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, medical costs included $200 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years.  Operating Costs  Operating costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 increased due to acquired and organic business growth and the absorption of new business development and start-up costs.  Income Tax Rate  The increases for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 in our effective income tax rate as compared to the comparable periods in 2009 resulted from limitations on the future deductibility of certain compensation related to the Health Reform Legislation, which was signed into law during the first quarter of 2010, as well as a benefit in the 2009 tax rate from the resolution of various historical federal and state income tax matters.  Reporting Segments  We have four reporting segments:        •    Health Benefits, which includes UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice;        •    OptumHealth;        •    Ingenix; and        •    Prescription Solutions.  See Note 12 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the types and services from which each of these reporting segments derives its revenues.  Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Benefits customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Benefits customers by OptumHealth, and consulting and other services sold to Health Benefits by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation.    36    Table of Contents The following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments:                                      (in millions, except percentages)   Three Months Ended June 30,     Six Months Ended June 30,      2010     2009     Increase(Decrease) 2010 vs. 2009     2010     2009     Increase(Decrease) 2010 vs. 2009     Revenues                                         Health Benefits   $ 21,638     $ 20,282     $ 1,356     7 %    $ 43,275     $ 40,954     $ 2,321     6 %    OptumHealth     1,454       1,356       98     7       2,871       2,688       183     7     Ingenix     529       421       108     26       1,034       806       228     28     Prescription Solutions     4,214       3,556       658     19       8,310       7,095       1,215     17     Eliminations     (4,571 )      (3,960 )      (611 )    nm       (9,033 )      (7,884 )      (1,149 )    nm                                                                   Consolidated revenues   $ 23,264     $ 21,655     $ 1,609     7 %    $ 46,457     $ 43,659     $ 2,798     6 %                                                                  Earnings from operations                                         Health Benefits   $ 1,544     $ 1,073     $ 471     44 %    $ 3,226     $ 2,394     $ 832     35 %    OptumHealth     161       142       19     13       312       300       12     4     Ingenix     60       59       1     2       113       108       5     5     Prescription Solutions     136       166       (30 )    (18 )      266       306       (40 )    (13 )    Consolidated earnings from                                                                                                       operations   $ 1,901     $ 1,440     $ 461     32 %    $ 3,917     $ 3,108     $ 809     26 %                                                                  Operating margin                                         Health Benefits     7.1 %      5.3 %         1.8 %      7.5 %      5.8 %         1.7 %    OptumHealth     11.1       10.5          0.6       10.9       11.2          (0.3 )    Ingenix     11.3       14.0          (2.7 )      10.9       13.4          (2.5 )    Prescription Solutions     3.2       4.7          (1.5 )      3.2       4.3          (1.1 )    Consolidated operating margin     8.2 %      6.6 %         1.6 %      8.4 %      7.1 %         1.3 %  nm = not meaningful  The following summarizes the number of individuals served by our Health Benefits businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of June 30, 2010 and 2009:                           Increase (Decrease)     (in thousands, except percentages)   2010   2009   2010 vs. 2009     Commercial risk-based   9,235   9,655   (420 )    (4 )%    Commercial fee-based   15,355   15,375   (20 )    (0 )                          Total commercial   24,590   25,030   (440 )    (2 )                          Medicare Advantage   2,040   1,740   300     17     Medicaid   3,185   2,750   435     16     Standardized Medicare supplement   2,725   2,625   100     4                           Total public and senior   7,950   7,115   835     12                           Total Health Benefits   32,540   32,145   395     1 %                        Health Benefits  The revenue growth in Health Benefits for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends, partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products, principally reflecting the decline in U.S. employment in 2009, and Medicare Advantage premium rate decreases. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 revenues were    37    Table of Contents  $10.2 billion and $20.2 billion for UnitedHealthcare; $9.0 billion and $18.3 billion for Ovations; and $2.5 billion and $4.8 billion for AmeriChoice, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 revenues were $10.3 billion and $20.6 billion for UnitedHealthcare; $8.0 billion and $16.4 billion for Ovations; and $2.0 billion and $4.0 billion for AmeriChoice, respectively.  Health Benefits earnings from operations and operating margins for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 increased over the prior year primarily due to factors that increased revenues described above as well as the effect of increased net favorable development in prior period medical costs.  OptumHealth  Increased revenues in OptumHealth for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 were driven by new business development in large scale public sector programs and increased sales of benefits and services to external employer markets, partially offset by a decline in revenues associated with a decrease in UnitedHealthcare commercial membership. As of June 30, 2010, OptumHealth provided services to 63 million consumers as compared to 58 million as of June 30, 2009.  Earnings from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 increased primarily due to the factors that increased revenues described above as well as the increased effectiveness of medical cost management.  Ingenix  Increased revenues in Ingenix for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 were primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and growth in health care information technology offerings and services focused on cost management, regulatory compliance and clinical research.  The decrease in operating margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 was primarily due to increases in the mix of lower margin services businesses, continued margin pressure in the pharmaceutical services business and continued investments in new growth areas.  Prescription Solutions  The increased Prescription Solutions revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our Ovations business. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 were $3.6 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 were $3.1 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively.  Prescription Solutions earnings from operations and operating margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 decreased primarily due to changes in performance-based pricing contracts with Medicare Part D plan sponsors, which were partially offset by prescription volume growth, increased usage of mail service and generic drugs by consumers and effective operating cost management.  LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Liquidity  Introduction   We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before depreciation, amortization and other non-cash    38    Table of Contents  expenses. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The diversity of our businesses, our geographic and customer diversity and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk-based businesses, which seek to match premium rate increases with future expected medical costs, partially mitigates the risk of rising medical and operating costs.  Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. We make these investments pursuant to our Board of Directors’ approved investment policy, which focuses on preservation of capital, credit quality, diversification, income and duration. The policy also generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations, tax implications and risk tolerances.  Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by NAIC. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval.  In 2010, based on the 2009 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that can be paid is $3.2 billion. For the six months ended June 30, 2010, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $1.2 billion, including $60 million of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $2.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. The total dividends included all of the ordinary dividend capacity of $3.1 billion, based upon 2008 statutory net income, capital and surplus levels. In some cases, ordinary dividends were classified as extraordinary dividends due to their increased size and/or accelerated timing. Given current statutory capital levels, we anticipate that our total regulated subsidiary dividends in 2010 will approximate ordinary dividend capacity.  Our non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, as well as the availability of our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, expanding our businesses through acquisitions, shareholder dividends, repaying debt and/or repurchasing shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions.    39    Table of Contents Results  A summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below:                  Six Months EndedJune 30,     (in millions)   2010     2009     Sources of cash:             Cash flows from operating activities   $ 1,928     $ 1,604     Sales of investments     1,522       2,635     Maturities of investments     1,426       1,296     Interest rate swap termination     0       513     Customer funds administered     1,108       674     Proceeds from issuance of commercial paper     880       0     Other     112       210                       Total sources of cash     6,976       6,932                       Uses of cash:             Purchases of investments     (3,258 )      (3,710 )    Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed     (165 )      (400 )    Retirement of long-term debt     (1,333 )      (900 )    Common stock repurchases     (1,241 )      (1,504 )    Other     (796 )      (597 )                      Total uses of cash     (6,793 )      (7,111 )                      Net increase (decrease) in cash   $ 183     $ (179 )                    2010 Cash Flows Compared to 2009 Cash Flows  Cash flows from operating activities increased $324 million, or 20%, for the six months ended June 30, 2010. Factors that increased cash flows from operating activities were growth in net earnings and related income tax effects, partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from operations related to the change in medical costs payable due to the acceleration of the payment cycle associated with the Medicare Part D program as well as the timing of other medical claim payments.  Cash flows used for investing activities increased $328 million, or 67%, primarily due to decreases in sales of investments.  Cash flows used for financing activities decreased $366 million, or 28%, primarily due to an increase in customer funds administered related to payables associated with CMS subsidies and a decrease in the amount of cash used for share repurchases, partially offset by an increase in the amount of cash dividends paid on our common stock.  Financial Condition  As of June 30, 2010, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $24.9 billion included $10.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $2.0 billion was held by non-regulated entities), $14.4 billion of debt securities and $455 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 equity securities, may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date.    40    Table of Contents  Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our $2.5 billion bank credit facility, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 3 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements.  Our investment portfolio has a weighted-average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of June 30, 2010. Included in the debt securities balance are $2.9 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties. We do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is “AA” as of June 30, 2010.  Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity  In addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:  Commercial Paper. We maintain a commercial paper program, which facilitates the issuance of senior unsecured debt sold on a discount basis with maturities of up to 270 days through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the $2.5 billion bank credit facility described below. We had $880 million of commercial paper outstanding as of June 30, 2010.  Bank Credit Facility. We have a $2.5 billion five-year revolving bank credit facility with 23 banks, which matures in May 2012. This facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of June 30, 2010. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on LIBOR plus a spread. As of June 30, 2010, the annual interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 0.5% to 1.0%.  Our bank credit facility contains various covenants, the most restrictive of which requires us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio below 50%. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio, calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders’ equity, was 30.1% and 32.1% as of June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of June 30, 2010.  Shelf Registration. In February 2008, we filed a universal S-3 shelf registration statement with the SEC registering an unspecified amount of debt securities.  Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at June 30, 2010 were as follows:                       Moody's   Standard & Poor's   Fitch       Ratings   Outlook   Ratings   Outlook   Ratings   Outlook   Senior unsecured debt   Baa1   Stable   A-   Negative   A-   Negative   Commercial paper   P-2   n/a   A-2   n/a   F1   n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have therefore adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital.  Debt Tender. In February 2010, we completed cash tender offers for $775 million in aggregate principal of certain of our outstanding fixed-rate notes to improve the matching of the interest rate exposure related to our floating rate assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We expect interest expense to be lower in 2010 as a result of the debt tender.    41    Table of Contents Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, subject to certain Board restrictions. In February 2010, the Board renewed and increased our share repurchase program, and authorized us to repurchase up to 120 million shares of our common stock. During the six months ended June 30, 2010, the Company repurchased 39 million shares at an average price of approximately $32 per share and an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. As of June 30, 2010, the Company had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 85 million shares of its common stock.  Dividends. In May 2010, our Board of Directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders and moved us to a quarterly dividend payment cycle. The first quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share was paid on June 21, 2010 to shareholders of record on June 7, 2010. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. Prior to May 2010 our policy had been to pay an annual dividend, the most recent of which was $0.03 per share paid on April 20, 2010 to shareholders of record on April 6, 2010.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2009 was disclosed in our 2009 10-K. During the six months ended June 30, 2010, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements” (ASU 2009-13). This update removes the criterion that entities must use objective and reliable evidence of fair value in separately accounting for deliverables and provides entities with a hierarchy of evidence that must be considered when allocating arrangement consideration. The new guidance also requires entities to allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on the deliverables’ relative selling price. The provisions will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in our fiscal year 2011 and must be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2009-13.  We have determined that all other recently issued accounting standards will not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, or do not apply to our operations.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  We prepared our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and trends and factor in known and projected trends. On an on-going basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates and this difference would be reported in our current operations.  For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of our 2009 10-K. As of June 30, 2010, our critical accounting policies have not changed from those described in our 2009 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2009 10-K.    42    Table of Contents CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK  Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of June 30, 2010, we had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as “A.” As of June 30, 2010, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this report include “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. Generally the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties and involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors.  Some factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include: the ultimate impact of the Health Reform Legislation, which could materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations through reduced revenues, increased costs, new taxes, and expanded liability, or require changes to the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business; our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs, including the impact of any new coverage requirements; the potential impact that new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement could have on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, including as a result of increases in medical, administrative, technology or other costs resulting from federal and state regulations affecting the health care industry; the potential impact of adverse economic conditions on our revenues (including decreases in enrollment resulting from increases in the unemployment rate and commercial attrition) and results of operations; regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures, which could affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share; uncertainties regarding changes in Medicare; potential reductions in revenue received from Medicare and Medicaid programs; our ability to execute contracts on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service professionals; our ability to attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent third-party brokers, consultants and agents; failure to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and data security regulations; events that may negatively affect our contracts with AARP; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with increased litigation; possible impairment of the value of our intangible assets if future results do not adequately support goodwill and intangible assets recorded for businesses that we acquire; increases in health care costs resulting from large-scale medical emergencies; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems; misappropriation of our proprietary technology; our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries to fund our obligations; the potential impact of our future cash and capital requirements on our ability to maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle; failure to complete or receive anticipated benefits of acquisitions; potential downgrades in our credit ratings; and failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements, including savings resulting from technology enhancement and administrative modernization.    43    Table of Contents This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. We discuss certain of these matters more fully, as well as certain risk factors that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, in Part II, Item 1A, of this report and in our other periodic and current filings with the SEC, including our 2009 10-K and our March 2010 10-Q. Any or all forward-looking statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements.      ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments.  As of June 30, 2010, $10.0 billion of our financial investments was classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $4.9 billion of our debt as of June 30, 2010 was at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.  The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of June 30, 2010, $14.7 billion of our investments was fixed-rate debt securities and $5.8 billion of our debt was fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.  We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices, as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we enter into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense. Our swap agreements converted a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments. Additional information on our derivative financial instruments is included in Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following table summarizes the impact of a hypothetical change in market interest rates by 1% or 2% as of June 30, 2010 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our financial investments and debt (in millions):                         Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate   InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a)     Interest ExpensePer Annum (a)     Fair Value ofFinancialInvestments     Fair Value ofDebt     2%   $  200     $  99     $  (1,128 )    $  (991 )    1%     100       49       (572 )      (576 )    (1)%     (20 )      (17 )      568       623     (2)%     nm       nm       1,135       1,353   nm = not meaningful      (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating rate assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2010, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 1% point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero.    44    Table of Contents As of June 30, 2010, we had $455 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were invested in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments.      ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In connection with the filing of this Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2010. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2010.  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the six months ended June 30, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    45    Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 13 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our 2009 10-K and the factors discussed in Part II, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our March 2010 10-Q, in each case as filed with the SEC, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2009 10-K and March 2010 10-Q are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.  There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2009 10-K and March 2010 10-Q.      ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
