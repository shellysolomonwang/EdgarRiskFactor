Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of our 2008 10-K, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (2008 10-K).    31    Table of Contents American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Our businesses may benefit from elements of the federal economic stimulus package that was enacted in response to the current recession. These elements include expansion of funding to state programs, which could mitigate funding pressure for AmeriChoice Medicaid offerings at the state level, and funding for health care information technology, which could expand market opportunities for Ingenix.  Proposed Health Care Reforms and Reimbursement Changes. There is regular discussion of health care reforms at both state and national levels, due to the size of and national interest in the health economy. Currently, the administration and numerous members of the U.S. Congress have proposed substantive changes to the U.S. health care system and expressed their intention to pass health care reform in 2009. Examples of health care reform proposals include policy changes that would change the dynamics of the health care industry, including having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care system such as competing with private health insurers, imposing new and potentially significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits, guaranteed coverage requirements combined with restrictions on our ability to price products based on our underwriting standards, or restructuring the Medicare or Medicaid programs. It is not yet clear what the final proposed legislative changes will be or whether a bill will ultimately pass both houses of Congress and be signed into law. Any health care reforms enacted may be phased in over a number of years, but, if enacted, could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our operating results, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes.  The administration and various congressional leaders have advanced proposals to reduce payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage over the intermediate term. Further, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented a reduction in Medicare Advantage reimbursements of approximately 5% for 2010. We have made a number of operating adjustments in response to these rate reductions. For 2010, we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis, terminated benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the Medicare Advantage program. The reduction of payments to private plans may also cause declines in the number of seniors participating in Medicare Advantage and the industry-wide revenues and earnings derived from these plans. Our operating results, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such declines. If industry-wide Medicare Advantage membership declines, there is likely to be increased demand for Medicare Supplemental insurance and Part D prescription drug coverage, and in both categories Ovations is a market leader.  We operate a diversified set of health care focused businesses; this business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors. Therefore, we could see simultaneous increases and decreases in demand for our various products and services, depending on the scope, shape and timing of health care reforms. It is difficult to predict the outcome of reform discussions with precision over the mid- to long-term time horizon. For additional discussions regarding our risks related to health care reforms and Medicare Advantage reimbursement changes, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of our 2008 10-K.    32    Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY                                          Three Months Ended September 30,     Nine Months Ended September 30,     (in millions, except percentages andper share data)               Increase(Decrease)           Increase(Decrease)      2009     2008     2009 vs. 2008     2009     2008     2009 vs. 2008     Revenues:                                         Premiums   $  19,729     $  18,294     $  1,435     8 %    $  59,586     $  55,027     $  4,559     8 %    Services     1,336       1,287       49     4       3,939       3,857       82     2     Products     490       432       58     13       1,378       1,186       192     16     Investment and other income     140       143       (3 )    (2 )      451       662       (211 )    (32 )                                                                  Total revenues     21,695       20,156       1,539     8       65,354       60,732       4,622     8                                                                   Operating costs:                                         Medical costs     16,171       14,943       1,228     8       49,248       45,344       3,904     9     Medical care ratio     82.0 %      81.7 %         0.3       82.7 %      82.4 %         0.3     Operating costs     3,156       2,974       182     6       9,321       9,617       (296 )    (3 )    Operating cost ratio     14.5 %      14.8 %         (0.3 )      14.3 %      15.8 %         (1.5 )    Cost of products sold     442       387       55     14       1,268       1,065       203     19     Depreciation and amortization     250       254       (4 )    (2 )      733       722       11     2                                                                   Total operating costs     20,019       18,558       1,461     8       60,570       56,748       3,822     7                                                                   Earnings from operations     1,676       1,598       78     5       4,784       3,984       800     20     Operating margin     7.7 %      7.9 %         (0.2 )      7.3 %      6.6 %         0.7     Interest expense     (137 )      (166 )      (29 )    (17 )      (407 )      (484 )      (77 )    (16 )                                                                  Earnings before income taxes     1,539       1,432       107     7       4,377       3,500       877     25     Provision for income taxes     (504 )      (512 )      (8 )    (2 )      (1,499 )      (1,249 )      250     20     Tax rate     32.7 %      35.8 %         (3.1 )      34.2 %      35.7 %         (1.5 )                                                                  Net earnings   $ 1,035     $ 920     $ 115     13 %    $ 2,878     $ 2,251     $ 627     28 %                                                                  Diluted net earnings per common share   $ 0.89     $ 0.75     $ 0.14     19 %    $ 2.43     $ 1.80     $ 0.63     35 %    Return on equity     18.6 %      18.7 %         (0.1 )%      17.7 %      15.2 %         2.5 %    Total people served     70       73       (3 )    (4 )%                      2009 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2008 RESULTS  Consolidated Financial Results  Revenues  Consolidated revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 increased primarily due to the increase in premium revenues in the Health Care Services reporting segment.  Premium Revenues. The increases in premium revenues for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 were primarily due to strong organic growth in risk-based offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases in response to growth in underlying medical costs. The effect of 2008 Health Care Services acquisitions also contributed to the increase in premium revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2009.    33    Table of Contents Investment and Other Income. The decrease in investment and other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was primarily due to capital market conditions causing lower investment yields and a decrease in net realized gains.  Medical Costs  Medical costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 increased primarily due to growth in public and senior markets risk-based businesses, elevated medical costs due to the H1N1 influenza virus, medical cost inflation and increased utilization of medical services, which was partially offset by net favorable development in prior period medical costs.  For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For the three months ended September 30, 2009, there was $100 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years and $90 million of net favorable medical cost development related to the first half of 2009. For the three months ended September 30, 2008, there was $10 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years and $120 million related to the first half of 2008. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, medical costs included $300 and $210 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years.  Operating Costs  Operating costs increased for the three months ended September 30, 2009 primarily due to acquired and organic business growth and the increased costs from state insurance assessments levied against premiums, a portion of which is in lieu of state income taxes in one of the states in which we operate. These costs were partially offset by productivity improvements in our underlying cost structure. Operating costs decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 due to certain expenses incurred in 2008 as discussed below, partially offset by the aforementioned items that increased third quarter operating costs and the impact of 2008 acquisitions.  Operating costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 included $882 million for settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs, $50 million related to estimated costs to conclude a legal matter and $46 million for employee severance related to operating cost reduction initiatives and other items, partially offset by a $185 million reduction in operating costs for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership in the individual Medicare Advantage business in Nevada in May 2008.  Interest Expense  Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 decreased primarily due to reduced levels in our debt outstanding and lower market interest rates on our floating-rate debt.  Income Tax Rate  Our income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 decreased primarily due to the favorable resolution of various historical state income tax matters and the change to a premium tax in lieu of an income tax in one of the states in which we operate, which increased operating costs and decreased income taxes.  Reporting Segments  We have four reporting segments:        •    Health Care Services, which includes UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice;        •    OptumHealth;    34    Table of Contents     •    Ingenix; and        •    Prescription Solutions.  See Note 13 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the types and services from which each of these reporting segments derives its revenues.  Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Care Services customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Care Services customers by OptumHealth, and consulting and other services sold to Health Care Services by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  The following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments:                                          Three Months Ended September 30,     Nine Months Ended September 30,     (in millions, except percentages)               Increase(Decrease)                 Increase(Decrease)      2009     2008     2009 vs. 2008     2009     2008     2009 vs. 2008     Revenues                                         Health Care Services   $  20,190     $  18,815     $  1,375     7 %    $  61,144     $  56,777     $  4,367     8 %    OptumHealth     1,415       1,294       121     9       4,103       3,919       184     5     Ingenix     481       383       98     26       1,287       1,126       161     14     Prescription Solutions     3,575       3,071       504     16       10,670       9,450       1,220     13     Eliminations     (3,966 )      (3,407 )      (559 )    nm       (11,850 )      (10,540 )      (1,310 )    nm                                                                   Consolidated revenues   $ 21,695     $ 20,156     $ 1,539     8 %    $ 65,354     $ 60,732     $ 4,622     8 %                                                                  Earnings from operations                                         Health Care Services   $ 1,244     $ 1,285     $ (41 )    (3 )%    $ 3,638     $ 3,800     $ (162 )    (4 )%    OptumHealth     172       175       (3 )    (2 )      472       541       (69 )    (13 )    Ingenix     64       57       7     12       172       153       19     12     Prescription Solutions     196       91       105     115       502       283       219     77     Corporate     —        (10 )      10     nm       —        (793 )      793     nm                                                                   Consolidated earnings from operations   $ 1,676     $ 1,598     $ 78     5 %    $ 4,784     $ 3,984     $ 800     20 %                                                                  Operating margin                                         Health Care Services     6.2 %      6.8 %         (0.6 )%      5.9 %      6.7 %         (0.8 )%    OptumHealth     12.2       13.5          (1.3 )      11.5       13.8          (2.3 )    Ingenix     13.3       14.9          (1.6 )      13.4       13.6          (0.2 )    Prescription Solutions     5.5       3.0          2.5       4.7       3.0          1.7                                                             Consolidated operating margin     7.7 %      7.9 %         (0.2 )%      7.3 %      6.6 %         0.7 %                                                           nm = not meaningful    35    Table of Contents The following summarizes the number of individuals served, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of September 30, 2009 and 2008:                   (in thousands, except percentages)   2009   2008   Increase(Decrease)2009 vs. 2008      Commercial risk-based   9,460   10,495   (1,035 )    (10 )%    Commercial fee-based   15,295   15,975   (680 )    (4 )                          Total commercial   24,755   26,470   (1,715 )    (6 )                          Medicare Advantage   1,770   1,480   290     20     Medicaid   2,795   2,340   455     19     Standardized Medicare supplement   2,660   2,510   150     6                           Total Public and Senior   7,225   6,330   895     14                           Total Health Care Services medical benefits   31,980   32,800   (820 )    (3 )%                         Health Care Services  The revenue growth in Health Care Services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 was primarily due to premium rate increases and growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses, partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products and a decrease in investment and other income. UnitedHealthcare revenues of $10.1 billion and $30.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively, were slightly lower than the comparable 2008 periods as the reduction in individuals served was partially offset by premium rate increases. Ovations revenues of $7.9 billion and $24.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively, increased by $1.2 billion, or 19%, and $3.1 billion, or 15%, respectively. The increases were primarily due to an increase in individuals served through Medicare Part D, Medicare Advantage and standardized Medicare Supplement offerings, as well as premium rate increases. AmeriChoice generated revenues of $2.1 billion and $6.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively, an increase of $475 million, or 29%, and $1.8 billion, or 43%, respectively over the comparable 2008 periods, primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid plans and premium rate increases. The year-over-year increase in revenue also includes the full nine-month impact from the Unison acquisition.  The decreases in Health Care Services earnings from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 were primarily due to a decrease in commercial business partially offset by the growth in lower margin public and senior markets businesses. The year-over-year decrease in the nine-month earnings from operations was also impacted by the $194 million reduction in investment and other income for this reporting segment. The UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 84.6% from 83.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, largely due to elevated medical costs related to the H1N1 influenza virus and changes in business mix, including a higher proportion of participants receiving care under unemployment-related benefit continuation programs. The UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio for both the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 was 83.4%. Health Care Services’ operating margins for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 decreased due to the factors that decreased earnings from operations as described previously.  OptumHealth  Increased revenues in OptumHealth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 were driven by new business development in large scale care and behavioral health programs for state clients and increased sales of benefits and services to existing clients, offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products. As of September 30, 2009 and 2008, OptumHealth provided services to approximately 58 million and 60 million consumers, respectively.    36    Table of Contents Earnings from operations and operating margins for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 decreased due to the decrease in membership described above, the cost of an increase in the usage of dental services, and a higher mix of lower margin public sector business. The nine month decreases also resulted from a reduction of investment and other income.  Ingenix  Improvements in Ingenix revenues and earnings from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 were primarily due to the impact of improved performance in the payer business, new internal service offerings and the effect of 2009 acquisitions. The decreases in operating margins for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 were primarily due to increases in the mix of lower margin business and increased operating costs related to investments in new product development in international offerings.  Prescription Solutions  The increased Prescription Solutions revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our Ovations business. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $3.1 billion and $9.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively. The comparable eliminations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008 were $2.7 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively.  Prescription Solutions earnings from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 increased primarily due to prescription volume growth, improved drug purchasing, gains in mail service drug fulfillment and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals.  LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Liquidity and Financial Condition  We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility.  Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. These investments are made pursuant to our Board of Directors’ approved investment policy, which focuses on preservation of capital, diversification and portfolio duration. It also generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations, tax implications and risk tolerances. Our regulated entities pay cash in excess of their capital needs to their non-regulated parent companies, typically in the form of dividends, when and as permitted by applicable regulations.  Our non-regulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, as well as the availability of our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses by making capital expenditures, expanding our services through business acquisitions, repaying debt and/or repurchasing shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions.  Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from net earnings, before depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative    37    Table of Contents  impact on our liquidity. The level of profitability of our risk-based business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases. This risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses, the geographic and customer diversity of our risk-based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes, which seek to match premium rate increases with future expected health care costs.  A summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below:                    Nine Months Ended September 30,     (in millions)    2009        2008       Sources of cash:             Cash provided by operating activities   $  4,345     $ 2,637     Sales of investments     3,516       4,932     Maturities of investments     2,116       2,444     Issuance of long-term debt     —        2,981     Interest rate swap termination     513       —      Other     683       1,035                       Total sources of cash     11,173       14,029                       Uses of cash:             Purchases of investments     (4,861 )      (8,368 )    Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed     (402 )      (3,945 )    Retirement of long-term debt     (1,350 )      (500 )    Common stock repurchases     (1,568 )      (2,505 )    Repayments of commercial paper, net     (99 )      (860 )    Other     (784 )      (635 )                      Total uses of cash     (9,064 )       (16,813 )                      Net increase (decrease) in cash   $  2,109     $  (2,784 )                     Cash flows from operating activities increased $1.7 billion, or 65%, year-over-year for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, primarily due to the payment in 2008 of $619 million, net of taxes, for the settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices, the 2009 increase in medical payables driven by membership growth in risk-based products in the public and senior markets businesses and the increase in net earnings. Additionally, we paid less taxes in 2009 due to tax law changes that took effect in 2008. The first nine months of 2008 included 2007 taxes due under the prior tax law, while the 2009 payment did not include prior year amounts.  Cash flows used for investing activities decreased $5.2 billion, or 98%, year-over-year for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 primarily due to acquisitions completed in the first nine months of 2008 and decreases in the usage of cash in 2009 for purchases of investments which more than offset the 2009 decreases in sales and maturities of investments.  Cash flows used for financing activities increased $2.1 billion year-over-year for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2008, which was partially offset by decreases in common stock repurchases in 2009 and the 2009 proceeds from our terminated interest rate swap contracts.  As of September 30, 2009, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $23.5 billion included $9.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $13.4 billion of debt securities and $570 million of equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our    38    Table of Contents  liquidity. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 equity securities, may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if the investment was sold at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows, reduce the need to sell investments in adverse markets. See Note 3 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements.  Our investment portfolio has a relatively short average duration and a weighted average credit rating of “AA” as of September 30, 2009. Included in the debt securities balance were $3.1 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by third parties. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors, and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is “AA” as of September 30, 2009.  Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we repurchased 66.4 million shares at an average price of approximately $24 per share and an aggregate cost of $1.6 billion. As of September 30, 2009, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional 36.5 million shares of our common stock.  Capital Resources  As of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had total commercial paper and long-term debt outstanding of $11.2 billion and $12.8 billion, respectively.  The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenant compliance and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital.  Shelf Registration. In February 2008, we filed a universal S-3 shelf registration statement with the SEC registering an unlimited amount of debt securities.  Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of September 30, 2009 were as follows:                        Moody’s   Standard & Poor’s   Fitch      Ratings   Outlook   Ratings   Outlook   Ratings   Outlook   Senior unsecured debt   Baa1   Stable   A-   Negative   A-   Negative   Commercial paper   P-2   n/a   A-2   n/a   F1   n/a  Debt Covenants. Our bank credit facility contains various covenants, the most restrictive of which requires us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio below 50%. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio, calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders’ equity, was 32.8% and 38.1% as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. We were in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants as of September 30, 2009.  Bank Credit Facilities. In November 2008, we entered into a $750 million 364-day revolving bank credit facility. Based upon expected liquidity and cash flows, we terminated this facility on July 31, 2009 in advance of its maturity.    39    Table of Contents In May 2007, we amended and restated our $1.3 billion five-year revolving bank credit facility which included increasing the capacity. There is currently $2.5 billion available under this facility, which matures in May 2012. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. As of September 30, 2009, the interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 0.4% to 0.9%. This facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general working capital purposes. As of September 30, 2009, we had no amounts outstanding under this facility.  Dividend Restrictions. We conduct a significant portion of our operations through subsidiaries that are subject to regulations and standards established by their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus.  The inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies could impact our level of reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures, business acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock. In addition, the inability to pay regulated dividends could impact our ability to repay our debt; however, our cash flows from operations of our unregulated businesses, as well as liquidity at the parent level in the form of cash and cash equivalent balances and commercial paper or bank funding, mitigate this risk. As of September 30, 2009, $965 million of cash was held by non-regulated subsidiaries and was available for general corporate use. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of our 2008 10-K, for a discussion of our risks related to dividend restrictions on our regulated subsidiaries.  In 2009, based on the 2008 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of dividends that could be paid without prior regulatory approval is $3.1 billion. Our regulated subsidiaries have paid their parent companies dividends of $2.1 billion through September 30, 2009. In 2008, the maximum amount of dividends that could be paid without prior regulatory approval was $3.0 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $1.2 billion of extraordinary dividends approved by state insurance regulators.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008 was disclosed in our 2008 10-K. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  We do not participate or seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of September 30, 2009, we did not have ownership interests in or structure off-balance sheet arrangements with SPEs.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements” (ASU 2009-13). This update removes the criterion    40    Table of Contents  that entities must use objective and reliable evidence of fair value in separately accounting for deliverables and provides entities with a hierarchy of evidence that must be considered when allocating arrangement consideration. The new guidance also requires entities to allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on the deliverables’ relative selling price. The provisions will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in our fiscal year 2011 and must be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2009-13.  In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 167, “Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)” (FAS 167); the guidance in FAS 167 has not been codified as of the filing date of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The new guidance amends the consolidation guidance to require companies to perform a qualitative assessment to determine which variable interest holder in a variable interest entity (VIE) is the primary beneficiary and therefore required to consolidate the VIE. The new guidance also amends the reconsideration guidance to require companies to reconsider continually their conclusion regarding which variable interest holder is the primary beneficiary. The guidance is effective for our fiscal year 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 167.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  We prepared our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In preparing these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and trends and factor in known and projected trends. On an on-going basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates and this difference would be reported in our current operations.  For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of our 2008 10-K. As of September 30, 2009, our critical accounting policies have not changed from those described in our 2008 10-K except as disclosed in Note 2 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements relating to recently adopted accounting standards. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2008 10-K.  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK  Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of September 30, 2009, we had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as “A.” As of September 30, 2009, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this report include “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These    41    Table of Contents  statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. Generally the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions, identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties and involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors.  Some factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include: our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our health care costs; our ability to respond quickly and appropriately to health care reforms; failure to comply with federal and state regulations affecting the health care industry; the potential impact of the adverse conditions in the global economy and extreme disruption of financial markets on our revenues, sources of liquidity, investment portfolio, and our results of operations; regulatory and other risks associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures, which could affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share; uncertainties regarding changes in Medicare; potential reductions in revenue received from Medicare and Medicaid programs, including as a result of reduced payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage; our ability to execute contracts on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service professionals; our ability to attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent third party brokers, consultants and agents; failure to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security; events that may negatively affect our contracts with AARP; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with increased litigation; the potential consequences of various governmental reviews and litigation matters related to our historical stock option practices; possible impairment of the value of our intangible assets if future results do not adequately support goodwill and intangible assets recorded for businesses that we acquire; increases in health care costs resulting from large-scale medical emergencies; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems; misappropriation of our proprietary technology; our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries to fund our obligations; failure to complete or receive anticipated benefits of acquisitions; and potential downgrades in our debt ratings.  This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. We discuss certain of these matters more fully, as well as certain risk factors that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, in Part II, Item 1A, of this report and in our other periodic and current filings with the SEC, including our 2008 10-K. Any or all forward-looking statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements.    42    Table of Contents   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments.  As of September 30, 2009, $9.5 billion of our financial investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $750 million of our debt as of September 30, 2009 was at interest rates that vary with market rates.  The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of September 30, 2009, $13.6 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $10.4 billion of our debt was fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.  We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices, as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time in normal markets, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense. The differential between the fixed rates received and the variable rates paid is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In January 2009, we terminated interest rate swap contracts with $4.9 billion in notional value to lock-in the benefit of low market interest rates.  The following table summarizes the impact of a hypothetical change in market interest rates by 1% or 2% as of September 30, 2009 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our financial investments and debt (in millions):                         Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate   InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a)     Interest ExpensePer Annum (a)     Fair Valueof FinancialInvestments     Fair Value ofDebt     2%   $  191     $  15     $  (1,067 )    $  (1,269 )    1%     95       8       (539 )      (680 )    (1)%     (19 )      (7 )      528       790     (2)%     nm       nm       1,053       1,716    nm = not meaningful      (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating rate assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2009, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates has been floored at zero and does not reflect the full 1% point reduction in interest income or interest expense.  As of September 30, 2009, we had $570 million of equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were held in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments.    43    Table of Contents   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In connection with the filing of this Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2009. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2009.  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    44    Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 14 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as filed with the SEC (2008 10-K), which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2008 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.  There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2008 10-K.      ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
