Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part II of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 (March 2010 10-Q).  Adverse Economic Conditions. The current U.S. recessionary economic environment has impacted demand for some of our products and services. For example, decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our employer customers, putting pressure on top line growth for our UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual and OptumHealth businesses. This workplace attrition will continue to impact UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s commercial risk and fee-based membership throughout 2010 and is expected to continue until national employment stabilizes. In contrast, our UnitedHealthcare Community & State business is experiencing growth in its state Medicaid offerings as employment rates fall. If the recessionary economic environment continues for a prolonged period, federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate and/or impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments. Our revenues are also impacted by U.S. monetary and fiscal policy. In response to recessionary conditions, the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained the target federal funds rate at a range of zero to 25 basis points.  In general, we believe that economic recessions could impact our revenue growth rate and our operating profitability. We also believe that government funding pressure, coupled with recessionary economic conditions, will impact the financial positions of hospitals, physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses. For additional discussions regarding how the adverse economic conditions could affect our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of our 2009 10-K.  Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. The Paul Wellstone-Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act 2008 (Mental Health Parity Act) became effective for plan years beginning on or after October 3, 2009 and requires that financial requirements and treatment limitations applicable to mental health or substance abuse benefits be no more restrictive than those imposed on medical and surgical benefits. The Mental Health Parity Act does not require plans to offer mental health or substance abuse benefits. The Federal Mental Health Parity Act became effective on July 1, 2010 for some plans, depending on their renewal date. Based on our current interpretations of the regulatory changes, we expect to see some impacts to risk-based behavioral health benefit costs beginning in 2011. Based on our customer renewal cycle, we believe the impact on our 2010 consolidated results of operations will not be material. We anticipate pricing actions in 2011 will partially mitigate the impact of revised regulations on our margins.    34    Table of Contents   RESULTS SUMMARY                                            Three Months Ended September 30,     Nine Months Ended September 30,     (in millions, except percentages and per share data)               Increase(Decrease)           Increase(Decrease)      2010     2009     2010 vs. 2009     2010     2009     2010 vs. 2009     Revenues:                                           Premiums   $ 21,467     $ 19,729     $ 1,738       9 %    $ 63,720     $ 59,586     $ 4,134       7 %    Services     1,469       1,336       133       10       4,246       3,939       307       8     Products     596       490       106       22       1,701       1,378       323       23     Investment and other income     136       140       (4 )      (3 )      458       451       7       2                                                                       Total revenues     23,668       21,695       1,973       9       70,125       65,354       4,771       7                                                                       Operating costs:                                           Medical costs     17,192       16,171       1,021       6       51,583       49,248       2,335       5     Medical care ratio     80.1 %      82.0 %           (1.9 )      81.0 %      82.7 %           (1.7 )    Operating costs     3,548       3,156       392       12       10,183       9,321       862       9     Operating cost ratio     15.0 %      14.5 %           0.5       14.5 %      14.3 %           0.2     Cost of products sold     536       442       94       21       1,553       1,268       285       22     Depreciation and amortization     247       250       (3 )      (1 )      744       733       11       2                                                                       Total operating costs     21,523       20,019       1,504       8       64,063       60,570       3,493       6                                                                       Earnings from operations     2,145       1,676       469       28       6,062       4,784       1,278       27     Operating margin     9.1 %      7.7 %           1.4       8.6 %      7.3 %           1.3     Interest expense     (119 )      (137 )      18       13       (363 )      (407 )      44       11                                                                       Earnings before income taxes     2,026       1,539       487       32       5,699       4,377       1,322       30     Provision for income taxes     (749 )      (504 )      (245 )      (49 )      (2,108 )      (1,499 )      (609 )      (41 )    Tax rate     37.0 %      32.7 %           4.3       37.0 %      34.2 %           2.8                                                                       Net earnings   $ 1,277     $ 1,035     $ 242       23 %    $ 3,591     $ 2,878     $ 713       25 %                                                                      Net margin     5.4 %      4.8 %           0.6 %      5.1 %      4.4 %           0.7 %    Diluted net earnings per common share   $ 1.14     $ 0.89     $ 0.25       28 %    $ 3.15     $ 2.43     $ 0.72       30 %    Return on equity (a)     20.3 %      18.6 %           1.7 %      19.5 %      17.7 %           1.8 %      (a) Return on equity is calculated as annualized net earnings divided by average equity for the last two and four quarters, for the three and nine months ended September 30, respectively.  2010 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2009 RESULTS  Consolidated Financial Results  Revenues  The increases in revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 were primarily due to strong organic growth in risk-based benefit offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends. Growth in customers served by our health services businesses, particularly through pharmaceutical benefit management programs, increasing revenues from public sector programs and increased sales of health care technology software and services also contributed to our revenue growth.  Medical Costs  Medical costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 increased primarily due to growth in our public and senior markets risk-based businesses and medical cost inflation, which were partially offset by decreases in commercial risk-based membership and net favorable development of prior period medical costs.  Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For the three    35    Table of Contents  months ended September 30, 2010, there was $80 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years and $150 million of net favorable medical cost development related to the first half of 2010. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, medical costs included $660 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The favorable development for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels and more efficient claims handling and processing.  For the three months ended September 30, 2009, there was $100 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years and $90 million of net favorable medical cost development related to the first half of 2009. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009 medical costs included $300 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years.  Operating Costs  Operating costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 increased due to acquired and organic growth in health services businesses, costs related to increased employee headcount and compensation, increased advertising costs, and the absorption of new business development and start-up costs.  Income Tax Rate  The increases in our effective income tax rate for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 as compared to the comparable periods in 2009 resulted from a benefit in the 2009 tax rate from the resolution of various historical state income tax matters and an increase in the 2010 rate related to limitations on the future deductibility of certain compensation related to the Health Reform Legislation.  Reporting Segments  We have four reporting segments:        •    Health Benefits, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State;        •    OptumHealth;        •    Ingenix; and        •    Prescription Solutions.  See Note 13 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the types and services from which each of these reporting segments derives its revenues.  Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Benefits customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Benefits customers by OptumHealth, and consulting and other services sold to Health Benefits by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation.    36    Table of Contents   The following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments:                                            Three Months Ended September 30,     Nine Months Ended September 30,     (in millions, except percentages)               Increase(Decrease)                 Increase(Decrease)      2010     2009     2010 vs. 2009     2010     2009     2010 vs. 2009     Revenues                                           Health Benefits   $ 21,963     $ 20,190     $ 1,773       9 %    $ 65,238     $ 61,144     $ 4,094       7 %    OptumHealth     1,469       1,415       54       4       4,340       4,103       237       6     Ingenix     592       481       111       23       1,626       1,287       339       26     Prescription Solutions     4,181       3,575       606       17       12,491       10,670       1,821       17     Eliminations     (4,537 )      (3,966 )      (571 )      nm       (13,570 )      (11,850 )      (1,720 )      nm                                                                       Consolidated revenues   $ 23,668     $ 21,695     $ 1,973       9 %    $ 70,125     $ 65,354     $ 4,771       7 %                                                                      Earnings from operations                                           Health Benefits   $ 1,793     $ 1,244     $ 549       44 %    $ 5,019     $ 3,638     $ 1,381       38 %    OptumHealth     143       172       (29 )      (17 )      455       472       (17 )      (4 )    Ingenix     70       64       6       9       183       172       11       6     Prescription Solutions     139       196       (57 )      (29 )      405       502       (97 )      (19 )                                                                      Consolidated earnings from operations   $ 2,145     $ 1,676     $ 469       28 %    $ 6,062     $ 4,784     $ 1,278       27 %                                                                      Operating margin                                           Health Benefits     8.2 %      6.2 %           2.0 %      7.7 %      5.9 %           1.8 %    OptumHealth     9.7       12.2            (2.5 )      10.5       11.5            (1.0 )    Ingenix     11.8       13.3            (1.5 )      11.3       13.4            (2.1 )    Prescription Solutions     3.3       5.5            (2.2 )      3.2       4.7            (1.5 )    Consolidated operating margin     9.1 %      7.7 %           1.4 %      8.6 %      7.3 %           1.3 %  nm = not meaningful  The following summarizes the number of individuals served by our Health Benefits businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of September 30, 2010 and 2009:                                   Increase (Decrease)     (in thousands, except percentages)   2010     2009     2010 vs. 2009     Commercial risk-based     9,330       9,460       (130 )      (1 )%    Commercial fee-based     15,370       15,295       75       0                                       Total commercial     24,700       24,755       (55 )      (0 )                                      Medicare Advantage     2,060       1,770       290       16     Medicaid     3,235       2,795       440       16     Standardized Medicare supplement     2,750       2,660       90       3                                       Total public and senior     8,045       7,225       820       11                                       Total Health Benefits     32,745       31,980       765       2 %                                    Health Benefits  The revenue growth in Health Benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends, partially offset by Medicare Advantage premium rate decreases and a decline in individuals served through risk-based commercial products, principally reflecting the decline in U.S. employment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 revenues    37    Table of Contents  were $10.4 billion and $30.6 billion for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual; $8.8 billion and $27.1 billion for UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement; and $2.7 billion and $7.5 billion for UnitedHealthcare Community & State, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 revenues were $10.1 billion and $30.7 billion for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual; $7.9 billion and $24.4 billion for UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement; and $2.1 billion and $6.1 billion for UnitedHealthcare Community & State, respectively.  Health Benefits earnings from operations and operating margins for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 increased over the prior year primarily due to factors that increased revenues described above as well as moderated levels of overall health system utilization and the effect of increased net favorable development in prior period medical costs.  OptumHealth  Increased revenues in OptumHealth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 were driven by new business development in large scale public sector programs and increased sales of benefits and services to external employer markets, partially offset by a decline in revenues associated with a decrease in UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual commercial membership and a loss of some smaller specialty benefits customers.  Earnings from operations and operating margins for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 decreased primarily due to the mix effect of lower margin public sector business, new market development and startup costs and costs related to the implementation of the Mental Health Parity Act.  Ingenix  Increased revenues in Ingenix for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 were primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and growth in health care information technology offerings and services focused on cost and data management and regulatory compliance.  The decrease in operating margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to increases in the mix of lower margin business, continued margin pressure in the pharmaceutical services business and continued investments in new growth areas.  Prescription Solutions  The increased Prescription Solutions revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement business. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 were $3.6 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 were $3.1 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively.  Prescription Solutions earnings from operations and operating margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 decreased primarily due to changes in performance-based pricing contracts with Medicare Part D plan sponsors, which were partially offset by prescription volume growth, increased usage of mail service and generic drugs by consumers and effective operating cost management.    38    Table of Contents   LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Liquidity  Introduction  We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our businesses while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before depreciation, amortization and other non-cash expenses. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The diversity of our businesses, our geographic and customer diversity and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk-based businesses, which seek to match premium rate increases with future expected medical costs, partially mitigates the risk of rising medical and operating costs.  Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, liquid, investment-grade, debt securities to improve our overall investment return. We make these investments pursuant to our Board of Directors’ approved investment policy, which focuses on preservation of capital, credit quality, diversification, income and duration. The policy also generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations, tax implications and risk tolerances.  Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the NAIC. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, the entire dividend is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval.  In 2010, based on the 2009 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that can be paid is $3.2 billion. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $2.1 billion, including $214 million of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $2.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. The total dividends received in 2009 included all of the ordinary dividend capacity of $3.1 billion, based upon 2008 statutory net income, capital and surplus levels. In some cases, ordinary dividends were classified as extraordinary dividends due to their increased size and/or accelerated timing. Given current statutory capital levels, we anticipate that our total regulated subsidiary dividends in 2010 will approximate ordinary dividend capacity.  Our non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, as well as the availability of our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, or return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.    39    Table of Contents   Results  A summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below:                    Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,     (in millions)   2010     2009     Sources of cash:             Cash flows from operating activities   $ 4,832     $ 4,345     Sales of investments     1,927       3,516     Maturities of investments     2,236       2,116     Interest rate swap termination     0       513     Customer funds administered     1,014       402     Proceeds from issuance of commercial paper     1,131       0     Other     199       281                       Total sources of cash     11,339       11,173                       Uses of cash:             Purchases of investments     (5,177 )      (4,861 )    Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed     (2,072 )      (402 )    Retirement of long-term debt     (1,333 )      (1,350 )    Common stock repurchases     (1,892 )      (1,568 )    Dividends paid     (313 )      (36 )    Other     (775 )      (847 )                      Total uses of cash     (11,562 )      (9,064 )                      Net (decrease) increase in cash   $ (223 )    $ 2,109                     2010 Cash Flows Compared to 2009 Cash Flows  Cash flows from operating activities increased $487 million, or 11%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Factors that increased cash flows from operating activities were growth in net earnings, a year over year decrease in payments to certain state programs and an increase in pharmacy rebate collections which were partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from operations related to the change in medical costs payable due to the acceleration of the payment cycle associated with the Medicare Part D program as well as the timing of other medical claim payments.  Cash flows used for investing activities increased $3.5 billion, primarily due to 2010 acquisitions and decreases in sales of investments.  Cash flows used for financing activities decreased $701 million, or 33%, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and an increase in customer funds administered related to payables associated with CMS subsidies partially offset by the 2009 proceeds from our terminated interest rate swap contracts, increases in the amount of cash used for share repurchases and an increase in the amount of cash dividends paid on our common stock.  Financial Condition  As of September 30, 2010, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $25.5 billion included $9.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.0 billion was held by non-regulated entities), $15.5 billion of debt securities and $487 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity. The use of different market    40    Table of Contents  assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 equity securities, may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our $2.5 billion bank credit facility, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 3 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements.  Our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weighted-average duration of 2.2 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of September 30, 2010. Included in the debt securities balance are $2.8 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties. We do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is “AA” as of September 30, 2010.  Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity  In addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:  Commercial Paper. We maintain a commercial paper program, which facilitates the issuance of senior unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the $2.5 billion bank credit facility described below. We had $1.1 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of September 30, 2010. Our issuance of commercial paper in 2010 was to maintain ample liquidity at the holding company level and due to increased acquisition activity.  Bank Credit Facility. We have a $2.5 billion five-year revolving bank credit facility with 23 banks, which matures in May 2012. This facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of September 30, 2010. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on LIBOR plus a spread. As of September 30, 2010, the annual interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 0.5% to 0.7%.  Our bank credit facility contains various covenants including requiring us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio below 50%. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio, calculated as debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders’ equity, was 30.1% and 32.1% as of September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of September 30, 2010.  Debt Issuance. In October 2010, we issued $750 million in senior unsecured notes under our February 2008 S-3 shelf registration statement. The issuance included $450 million of 3.875% fixed-rate notes due October 2020 and $300 million of 5.700% fixed-rate notes due October 2040. We intend to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at September 30, 2010 were as follows:                            Moody’s   Standard & Poor’s   Fitch   A.M. Best      Ratings   Outlook   Ratings   Outlook   Ratings   Outlook   Ratings   Outlook   Senior unsecured debt   Baa1   Stable   A-   Stable   A-   Negative   bbb+   Stable   Commercial paper   P-2   n/a   A-2   n/a   F1   n/a   AMB-2   n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenant compliance and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have therefore adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital.    41    Table of Contents   Debt Tender. In February 2010, we completed cash tender offers for $775 million in aggregate principal of certain of our outstanding fixed-rate notes to lower interest expense and improve the matching of the interest rate exposure related to our floating rate assets and liabilities on our balance sheet.  Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, subject to certain Board restrictions. In February 2010, the Board renewed and increased our share repurchase program, and authorized us to repurchase up to 120 million shares of our common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, the Company repurchased 59 million shares at an average price of approximately $32 per share and an aggregate cost of $1.9 billion. As of September 30, 2010, the Company had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 65 million shares of its common stock.  Dividends. In May 2010, our Board of Directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders and moved us to a quarterly dividend payment cycle. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. Prior to May 2010, our policy had been to pay an annual dividend.  The following table provides details of our dividend payments in 2010:                     Record Date   Payment Date     Amount per Share     Total Amount Paid                    (in millions)     4/6/2010     4/20/2010     $ 0.030     $ 34     6/7/2010     6/21/2010       0.125       140    9/14/2010     9/28/2010       0.125       139   CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2009 was disclosed in our 2009 10-K. In October 2010, we issued a total of $750 million of senior unsecured debt with $450 million due in 2020 and $300 million due in 2040. There were no other material changes outside the ordinary course of business. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  We have determined that there have been no recently issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, or apply to our operations.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  We prepared our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and trends and factor in known and projected trends. On an on-going basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates and this difference would be reported in our current operations.  For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of our 2009 10-K. As of September 30, 2010, our critical accounting policies have not changed from those described in our 2009 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2009 10-K.    42    Table of Contents   CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK  Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of September 30, 2010, we had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as “A.” As of September 30, 2010, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this report include “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. Generally the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties and involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors.  Some factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include: the ultimate impact of the Health Reform Legislation, which could materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations through reduced revenues, increased costs, new taxes, and expanded liability, or require changes to the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business; our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs, including the impact of any new coverage requirements; the potential impact that new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement could have on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, including as a result of increases in medical, administrative, technology or other costs resulting from federal and state regulations affecting the health care industry; the potential impact of adverse economic conditions on our revenues (including decreases in enrollment resulting from increases in the unemployment rate and commercial attrition) and results of operations; regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures, which could affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share; uncertainties regarding changes in Medicare; potential reductions in revenue received from Medicare and Medicaid programs; our ability to execute contracts on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service professionals; our ability to attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent third-party brokers, consultants and agents; failure to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and data security regulations; events that may negatively affect our contracts with AARP; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with increased litigation; possible impairment of the value of our intangible assets if future results do not adequately support goodwill and intangible assets recorded for businesses that we acquire; increases in health care costs resulting from large-scale medical emergencies; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems; misappropriation of our proprietary technology; our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries to fund our obligations; the potential impact of our future cash and capital requirements on our ability to maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle; failure to complete or receive anticipated benefits of acquisitions; potential downgrades in our credit ratings; and failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements, including savings resulting from technology enhancement and administrative modernization.    43    Table of Contents   This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. We discuss certain of these matters more fully, as well as certain risk factors that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, in Part II, Item 1A, of this report and in our other periodic and current filings with the SEC, including our 2009 10-K and our March 2010 10-Q. Any or all forward-looking statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements.      ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments.  As of September 30, 2010, $9.6 billion of our financial investments was classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $5.2 billion of our debt as of September 30, 2010 was at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.  The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of September 30, 2010, $15.7 billion of our investments was fixed-rate debt securities and $5.8 billion of our debt was fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.  We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices, as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we enter into interest rate swap agreements with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense. Our swap agreements converted a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments. Additional information on our derivative financial instruments is included in Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% or 2% as of September 30, 2010 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our financial investments and debt (in millions):                         Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate   InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a)     Interest ExpensePer Annum (a)     Fair Value ofFinancialInvestments     Fair Value ofDebt     2%   $  192     $  104     $ (1,199 )    $ (1,056 )    1%     96       52       (608 )      (574 )    (1)%     (16 )      (15 )      606       663     (2)%     nm       nm        1,217        1,447   nm = not meaningful      (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating rate assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2010, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 1% point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero.    44    Table of Contents   As of September 30, 2010, we had $487 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were invested in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments.      ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In connection with the filing of this Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2010. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2010.  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    45    Table of Contents   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 14 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our 2009 10-K and the factors discussed in Part II, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our March 2010 10-Q, in each case as filed with the SEC, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2009 10-K and March 2010 10-Q are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.  There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2009 10-K and March 2010 10-Q.      ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
