Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of our 2008 10-K, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (2008 10-K).  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Our businesses may benefit from elements of the federal economic stimulus package that was enacted in response to the current recession. These elements include expansion of funding to state programs, which could mitigate funding pressure for AmeriChoice Medicaid offerings at the state level, and funding for health care information technology, which could expand market opportunities for Ingenix.  Proposed Health Care Reforms and Reimbursement Changes. There is regular dialogue about health care reforms at both state and national levels, due to the size of and national interest in the health economy. Examples of health care reform proposals include policy changes that would change the dynamics of the health care industry, including having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care system such as competing with private health insurers, imposing new taxes on health insurers, or restructuring of the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Any health care reforms enacted may be phased in over a number of years, but, if enacted, could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our operating results, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes even if we correctly predict their occurrence.  The new administration and various congressional leaders have expressed their interest in reducing payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage over the intermediate term. Further, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced a reduction in Medicare Advantage reimbursements of approximately 5% for 2010. Management believes that there are a number of annual adjustments we can make to our operations which may serve to partially offset any impact from these rate reductions. For example, we can adjust members’ benefits and/or premiums, decide on a county-by-county basis which geographies to participate in and seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute on these or other strategies to address changes in the Medicare Advantage program. The reduction of payments to private plans may also cause declines in the number of seniors participating in Medicare Advantage and the industry-wide revenues and earnings derived from these plans. Our operating results, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such declines. If industry-wide Medicare Advantage membership declines, there is likely to be increased demand for Medicare Supplemental insurance and Part D prescription drug coverage, and in both categories Ovations is a market leader.  We operate a diversified set of health care focused businesses; this business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors. Therefore, we could see simultaneous increases and decreases in demand for our various products and services, depending on the scope, shape and timing of health care reforms. It is difficult to predict the outcome of reform discussions with precision over the mid- to long-term time horizon. For additional discussions regarding our risks related to health care reforms and Medicare Advantage reimbursement changes, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of our 2008 10-K.    32    Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY                                          Three Months Ended June 30,     Six Months Ended June 30,     (in millions, except percentages and pershare data)   2009     2008     Increase(Decrease)2009 vs. 2008     2009     2008     Increase(Decrease)2009 vs. 2008     Revenues:                                         Premiums   $  19,746     $  18,344     $  1,402     8 %    $  39,857     $  36,733     $  3,124     9 %    Services     1,307       1,297       10     1       2,603       2,570       33     1     Products     449       391       58     15       888       754       134     18     Investment and other income     153       240       (87 )    (36 )      311       519       (208 )    (40 )                                                                  Total revenues     21,655       20,272       1,383     7       43,659       40,576       3,083     8                                                                   Operating costs:                                         Medical costs     16,507       15,257       1,250     8       33,077       30,401       2,676     9     Medical care ratio     83.6 %      83.2 %         0.4       83.0 %      82.8 %         0.2     Operating costs     3,037       3,746       (709 )    (19 )      6,165       6,643       (478 )    (7 )    Operating cost ratio     14.0 %      18.5  %         (4.5 )      14.1 %      16.4 %         (2.3 )    Cost of products sold     422       353       69     20       826       678       148     22     Depreciation and amortization     249       243       6     2       483       468       15     3                                                                   Total operating costs     20,215       19,599       616     3       40,551       38,190       2,361     6                                                                   Earnings from operations     1,440       673       767     114       3,108       2,386       722     30     Operating margin     6.6 %      3.3 %         3.3       7.1 %      5.9 %         1.2     Interest expense     (139 )      (164 )      (25 )    (15 )      (270 )      (318 )      (48 )    (15 )                                                                  Earnings before income taxes     1,301       509       792     156       2,838       2,068       770     37     Provision for income taxes     (442 )      (172 )      270     157       (995 )      (737 )      258     35     Tax rate     34.0 %      33.8 %         0.2       35.1 %      35.6 %         (0.5 )                                                                  Net earnings   $ 859     $ 337     $ 522     155 %    $ 1,843     $ 1,331     $ 512     38 %                                                                  Diluted net earnings per common share   $ 0.73     $ 0.27     $ 0.46     170 %    $ 1.54     $ 1.05     $ 0.49     47 %    Return on equity     16.0 %      6.9 %         9.1 %      17.4 %      13.5 %         3.9 %    Total people served     71       73       (2 )    (3 )%                      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Consolidated Financial Results  Revenues  Consolidated revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 increased over the comparable 2008 periods primarily due to the increase in premium revenues in the Health Care Services reporting segment.  Premium Revenues. The increases in premium revenues for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 over the comparable 2008 periods were primarily due to strong organic growth in risk-based offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases in response to growth in underlying medical costs. The effect of 2008 Health Care Services acquisitions also contributed to the increase in premium revenues in the six month period.  Product Revenues. Product revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 increased over the comparable 2008 periods due to increased prescription volume at our Prescription Solutions reporting segment.    33    Table of Contents Investment and Other Income. The decreases in investment and other income for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 over the comparable 2008 periods were primarily due to capital market conditions causing lower investment yields and a decrease in realized gains.  Medical Costs  Medical costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 increased primarily due to growth in public and senior markets risk-based businesses, medical cost inflation and increased utilization of medical services.  For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For the three months ended June 30, 2009, there was no net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years and $30 million of net favorable medical cost development related to the first quarter of 2009. For the three months ended June 30, 2008, there was no net medical cost development related to prior fiscal years or related to the first quarter of 2008. For the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, medical costs included $200 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years.  Operating Costs   Operating costs decreased in 2009 for both the three and six month periods primarily due to the effect of certain expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2008 as discussed below and productivity improvements to our underlying cost structure, partially offset by increased costs due to retroactive and current state insurance premium assessments and the impact of 2008 acquisitions.  Operating costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 included pre-tax Operating Costs of $922 million for settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs, and $46 million for employee severance related to operating cost reduction initiatives and other items, partially offset by a $185 million reduction in operating costs for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership in the individual Medicare Advantage business in Nevada in May 2008.  Cost of Products Sold  Cost of products sold for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 increased over the comparable 2008 periods due to increased prescription volume at our Prescription Solutions reporting segment.  Interest Expense  Interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 decreased over the comparable 2008 periods primarily due to reduced levels in our debt outstanding and lower market interest rates on our floating-rate debt.  Reporting Segments  We have four reporting segments:        •    Health Care Services, which includes UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice;        •    OptumHealth;        •    Ingenix; and        •    Prescription Solutions.  See Note 12 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the types and services from which each of these reporting segments derives its revenues.    34    Table of Contents Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Care Services customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Care Services customers by OptumHealth, and consulting and other services sold to Health Care Services by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  The following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008:                                          Three Months Ended June 30,     Six Months Ended June 30,     (in millions, except percentages)   2009     2008     Increase(Decrease)2009 vs. 2008     2009     2008     Increase(Decrease)2009 vs. 2008     Revenues                                         Health Care Services   $  20,282     $  18,945     $  1,337     7 %    $  40,954     $  37,962     $  2,992     8 %    OptumHealth     1,356       1,321       35     3       2,688       2,625       63     2     Ingenix     421       381       40     10       806       743       63     8     Prescription Solutions     3,556       3,173       383     12       7,095       6,379       716     11     Eliminations     (3,960 )      (3,548 )      (412 )    nm       (7,884 )      (7,133 )      (751 )    nm                                                                   Consolidated revenues   $ 21,655     $ 20,272     $ 1,383     7 %    $ 43,659     $ 40,576     $ 3,083     8 %                                                                  Earnings from operations                                         Health Care Services   $ 1,073     $ 1,144     $ (71 )    (6 )%    $ 2,394     $ 2,515     $ (121 )    (5 )%    OptumHealth     142       169       (27 )    (16 )      300       366       (66 )    (18 )    Ingenix     59       49       10     20       108       96       12     13     Prescription Solutions     166       94       72     77       306       192       114     59     Corporate     —        (783 )      783     nm       —        (783 )      783     nm                                                                   Consolidated earnings from operations   $ 1,440     $ 673     $ 767     114 %    $ 3,108     $ 2,386     $ 722     30 %                                                                  Operating margin                                         Health Care Services     5.3 %      6.0 %         (0.7 )%      5.8 %      6.6 %         (0.8 )%    OptumHealth     10.5       12.8          (2.3 )      11.2       13.9          (2.7 )    Ingenix     14.0       12.9          1.1       13.4       12.9          0.5     Prescription Solutions     4.7       3.0          1.7       4.3       3.0          1.3                                                             Consolidated operating margin     6.6 %      3.3 %         3.3 %      7.1 %      5.9 %         1.2 %                                                           nm = not meaningful  The following summarizes the number of individuals served, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of June 30, 2009 and 2008:                   (in thousands, except percentages)   2009   2008   Increase(Decrease)2009 vs. 2008     Commercial risk-based   9,655   10,490   (835 )    (8 )%    Commercial fee-based   15,375   16,000   (625 )    (4 )                          Total commercial   25,030   26,490   (1,460 )    (6 )                          Medicare Advantage   1,740   1,455   285     20     Medicaid   2,750   2,255   495     22     Standardized Medicare supplement   2,625   2,475   150     6                           Total Public and Senior   7,115   6,185   930     15                           Total Health Care Services medical benefits   32,145   32,675   (530 )    (2 )%                           35    Table of Contents Health Care Services  The revenue growth in Health Care Services for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 was primarily due to premium rate increases and growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses, partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products and a decrease in investment and other income. UnitedHealthcare revenues of $10.3 billion and $20.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, were essentially flat compared to the comparable 2008 periods as the reduction in consumers served was offset by premium rate increases. Ovations revenues of $8.0 billion and $16.4 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, increased over the comparable 2008 periods by $928 million, or 13%, and $1.9 billion, or 13%. The increases were primarily due to an increase in individuals served through Medicare Part D, Medicare Advantage and standardized Medicare Supplement offerings, as well as premium rate increases. AmeriChoice generated revenues of $2.0 billion and $4.0 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, an increase of $632 million, or 45%, and $1.3 billion, or 51%, over the comparable 2008 periods, primarily due to the impact of a 2008 acquisition, an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid plans and premium rate increases.  The decreases in Health Care Services earnings from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 over the comparable 2008 periods were primarily due to the three and six month year-over-year decreases in investment and other income for this reporting segment of $78 million and $190 million, respectively. The UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 84.2% from 83.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, largely due to elevated medical costs related to the H1N1 influenza virus. The UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 decreased to 82.8% from 83.2%, respectively, primarily due to the net favorable change in prior period reserve development as well as the impact of Leap Year in 2008. Health Care Services’ operating margins for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 decreased from the comparable 2008 operating margins due to decreases in investment income and the growth in comparatively lower margin public and senior markets businesses.  OptumHealth  Increased revenues in OptumHealth for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 were driven by new business development in large scale care and behavioral health programs for state clients and increased sales of benefits and services to existing clients, offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products. As of June 30, 2009, OptumHealth provided services to approximately 58 million consumers.  Earnings from operations and operating margins for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 decreased due to the decrease in membership described above, the cost of an increase in the usage of dental services, a reduction of investment and other income and a higher mix of lower margin public sector business.  Ingenix  Improvements in Ingenix revenues and earnings from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 were primarily due to the impact of new internal service offerings and the effect of 2008 acquisitions. The increases in operating margins for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 were primarily due to operating leverage from revenue growth coupled with effective cost management.  Prescription Solutions  The increased Prescription Solutions revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our Ovations business. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $3.1 billion and $6.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively. The comparable eliminations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 were $2.8 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively.    36    Table of Contents Prescription Solutions earnings from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 increased primarily due to prescription volume growth, improved drug purchasing, gains in mail service drug fulfillment and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals.  LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Liquidity and Financial Condition  We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility.  Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. These investments are made pursuant to our Board of Directors’ approved investment policy, which focuses on preservation of capital, diversification and portfolio duration. It also generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations, tax implications and risk tolerances. Cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities is paid to their non-regulated parent companies, typically in the form of dividends, for general corporate use, when and as permitted by applicable regulations.  Our non-regulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, as well as the availability of our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses by making capital expenditures, expanding our services through business acquisitions, repaying debt and/or repurchasing shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions.  Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from net earnings, prior to depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The level of profitability of our risk-based business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases. This risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses, the geographic and customer diversity of our risk-based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes, which seek to match premium rate increases with future expected health care costs.    37    Table of Contents A summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below:                    Six Months Ended June 30,     (in millions)   2009     2008     Sources of cash:             Cash provided by operating activities   $ 1,604     $ 880     Sales of investments     2,635       3,746     Maturities of investments     1,296       1,866     Issuance of long-term debt     —        2,981     Interest rate swap termination     513       —      Other     884       943                       Total sources of cash     6,932       10,416                       Uses of cash:             Purchases of investments     (3,710 )      (6,555 )    Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed     (400 )      (3,897 )    Retirement of long-term debt     (900 )      (500 )    Common stock repurchases     (1,504 )      (2,052 )    Other     (597 )      (1,004 )                      Total uses of cash      (7,111 )       (14,008 )                      Net decrease in cash   $ (179 )    $ (3,592 )                     Cash flows from operating activities increased $724 million, or 82%, year-over-year for the six months ended June 30, 2009, primarily due to the increase in net earnings and the increase in medical payables driven by membership growth in risk-based products in the public and senior markets businesses. Additionally, less taxes were paid in 2009 due to tax law changes which took effect in 2008. The first six months of 2008 included 2007 taxes due under the prior tax law, while the 2009 payment did not include prior year amounts.  Cash flows used for investing activities decreased $4.6 billion, or 90%, year-over-year for the six months ended June 30, 2009 primarily due to acquisitions completed in the first six months of 2008 and decreases in the usage of cash in 2009 for purchases of investments which more than offset the 2009 decreases in sales and maturities of investments.  Cash flows used for financing activities were $1.3 billion compared to cash flows from financing activities of $598 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The change in cash flows was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2008 which was partially offset by decreases in common stock repurchases in 2009 and the 2009 proceeds from our terminated interest rate swap contracts.  As of June 30, 2009, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $21.1 billion included $7.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $13.4 billion of debt securities and $498 million of equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 equity securities, may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if the investment was sold at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows, reduce the need to sell investments in adverse markets. See Note 3 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements.  Our investment portfolio has a relatively short average duration and a weighted average credit rating of “AA” as of June 30, 2009. Included in the debt securities balance were $3.2 billion of state and municipal obligations that     38    Table of Contents  are guaranteed by third parties. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors, and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is “AA” as of June 30, 2009 for the securities for which such information is available.  Commercial Paper. Commercial paper consists of senior unsecured debt sold on a discounted basis with maturities of up to 270 days. As of June 30, 2009, we had $60 million of outstanding commercial paper with interest rates ranging from 0.9% to 1.0%. This range in rates reflects decreases in the market rates for Tier-2 credit-rated commercial paper.  Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, we repurchased 64.1 million shares at an average price of approximately $23 per share and an aggregate cost of $1.5 billion. As of June 30, 2009, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional 38.8 million shares of our common stock.  Capital Resources  As of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had commercial paper and long-term debt outstanding of $11.7 billion and $12.8 billion, respectively.  The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have therefore adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital.  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments. We maintained a highly liquid position, with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $21.3 billion as of June 30, 2009. As further described under “Dividend Restrictions,” many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. As of June 30, 2009, $665 million of our $21.3 billion of cash and investments was held by non-regulated subsidiaries and was available for general corporate use.  Shelf Registration. In February 2008, we filed a universal S-3 shelf registration statement with the SEC registering an unlimited amount of debt securities.  Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at June 30, 2009 were as follows:                        Moody’s   Standard & Poor’s   Fitch      Ratings   Outlook   Ratings   Outlook   Ratings   Outlook   Senior unsecured debt   Baa1   Stable   A-   Negative   A-   Negative   Commercial paper   P-2   n/a   A-2   n/a   F1   n/a  Debt Covenants. Our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants, the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio below 50%. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio, calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders’ equity, was 35.2% and 38.1% as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. We were in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants as of June 30, 2009.    39    Table of Contents Bank Credit Facilities. In November 2008, we entered into a $750 million 364-day revolving bank credit facility. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. At June 30, 2009, the interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 1.7% to 2.1%. As of June 30, 2009, we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility and based upon current and expected liquidity and cash flows, we terminated this revolving credit facility in advance of maturity on July 31, 2009.  In May 2007, we amended and restated our $1.3 billion five-year revolving bank credit facility which included increasing the capacity. There is currently $2.5 billion available under this credit facility which matures in May 2012. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on LIBOR plus a spread. At June 30, 2009, the interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 0.5% to 1.4%. This credit facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general working capital purposes. As of June 30, 2009, we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility.  Dividend Restrictions. We conduct a significant portion of our operations through subsidiaries that are subject to regulations and standards established by their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus.  An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies could impact our level of reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures, business acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock. In addition, an inability to pay regulated dividends could impact our ability to repay our debt; however, our cash flows from operations of our unregulated businesses, as well as liquidity at the parent level in the form of cash and cash equivalent balances and commercial paper or bank funding, mitigate this risk. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of our 2008 10-K, for a discussion of our risks related to dividend restrictions on our regulated subsidiaries.  In 2009, based on the 2008 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval is $3.1 billion, of which our regulated subsidiaries have paid their parent companies dividends of $1.4 billion through June 30, 2009. In 2008, the maximum amount of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval was $3.0 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $1.2 billion of extraordinary dividends approved by state insurance regulators.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008 was disclosed in our 2008 10-K. During the six months ended June 30, 2009, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  We do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of June 30, 2009, we did not have ownership interests in or structure off-balance sheet arrangements with SPEs.    40    Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  We prepared our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In preparing these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and trends and factor in known and projected trends. On an on-going basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates and this difference would be reported in our current operations.  For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of our 2008 10-K. As of June 30, 2009, our critical accounting policies have not changed from those described in our 2008 10-K except as disclosed in Note 2 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements relating to recently adopted accounting standards. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2008 10-K.  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK  Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of June 30, 2009, we had an aggregate $2 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as “A.” As of June 30, 2009, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this report include “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. Generally the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions, identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties and involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors.  Some factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include: our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our health care costs; our ability to respond quickly and appropriately to health care reforms; failure to comply with federal and state regulations affecting the managed care industry; the potential impact of the adverse conditions in the global economy and extreme disruption of financial markets on our revenues, sources of liquidity, investment portfolio, and our results of operations; regulatory and other risks associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures, which could affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share, including as a result of new entrants into our market, and consolidation of health care companies and suppliers; uncertainties regarding changes in Medicare, including coordination of information systems and accuracy of certain assumptions; potential     41    Table of Contents  reductions in revenue received from Medicare and Medicaid programs, including as a result of reduced payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage; our ability to execute contracts on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service professionals; our ability to attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent third party brokers, consultants and agents; failure to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security; events that may negatively affect our contracts with AARP; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with increased litigation; the potential consequences of various governmental reviews and litigation matters related to our historical stock option practices and the potential consequences of each of these matters on our business, credit ratings and debt; events that may adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio; possible impairment of the value of our intangible assets if future results do not adequately support goodwill and intangible assets recorded for businesses that we acquire; increases in health care costs resulting from large-scale medical emergencies; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, which could result in the loss of existing customers, difficulties in attracting new customers, difficulties in determining medical costs estimates and appropriate pricing, customer and physician and health care professional disputes, regulatory violations, increases in operating costs, or other adverse consequences; misappropriation of our proprietary technology; our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries to fund our obligations; failure to complete or receive anticipated benefits of acquisitions; and potential downgrades in our debt ratings.  This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. We discuss certain of these matters more fully, as well as certain risk factors that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, in Part II, Item 1A, of this report and in our other periodic and current filings with the SEC, including our 2008 10-K. Any or all forward-looking statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements.    42    Table of Contents   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments.  As of June 30, 2009, $7.2 billion of our financial investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $810 million of our debt as of June 30, 2009 was at interest rates that vary with market rates.  The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of June 30, 2009, $13.6 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $10.9 billion of our debt was fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.  We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices, as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense. The differential between the fixed rates received and the variable rates paid is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In January 2009, we terminated interest rate swap contracts with $4.9 billion in notional value to lock-in the benefit of low market interest rates. Additional information on our derivative financial instruments is included in Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following table summarizes the impact of a hypothetical change in market interest rates by 1% or 2% as of June 30, 2009 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our financial investments and debt (in millions):                         Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate   InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a)     Interest ExpensePer Annum (a)     Fair Valueof FinancialInvestments     Fair Value ofDebt     2%   $  145     $ 16     $  (1,063 )    $  (1,091 )    1%     72       8       (541 )      (580 )    (1)%     (22 )      (8 )      541       668     (2)%     nm        (10 )      1,079       1,447    nm = not meaningful      (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating rate assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2009, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates has been floored at zero and does not reflect the full 1% point reduction in interest income or 2% point reduction for interest expense.  As of June 30, 2009, we had $498 million of equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were held in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments.    43    Table of Contents   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In connection with the filing of this Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2009. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2009.  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    44    Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 13 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as filed with the SEC (2008 10-K), which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2008 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.  There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2008 10-K.      ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
