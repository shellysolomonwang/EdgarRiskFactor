ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in AbbVie’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, except for the following:   AbbVie’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of its merger with Pharmacyclics will depend on its ability to effectively and profitably commercialize IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib).   The anticipated benefits of AbbVie’s merger with Pharmacyclics will depend on AbbVie’s ability to: effectively and profitably commercialize IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib), including AbbVie’s ability to create and meet continued market demand, achieve market acceptance and generate product sales; ensure that the active pharmaceutical ingredient for IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand; and ensure that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) to AbbVie’s customers. The commercialization of IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow the approved indications, the relative price of IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) as compared to alternative treatment options, and changes to the label for IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) is unsuccessful, AbbVie’s ability to generate revenue from product sales and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger will be adversely affected.   AbbVie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations.   The amount of debt that AbbVie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to AbbVie and its investors. These consequences include, among other things, requiring a portion of AbbVie’s cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow AbbVie’s business. AbbVie recently incurred additional debt in connection with the merger with Pharmacyclics, which could further increase the above risks and may cause AbbVie’s credit rating to be downgraded. In addition, AbbVie’s cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and AbbVie may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance its debt.   44      Table of Contents   ITEM 2.
