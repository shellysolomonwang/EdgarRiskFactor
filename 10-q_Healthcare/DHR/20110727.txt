ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  In addition to the risks identified below, information regarding risk factors appears in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Information Related to Forward-Looking Statements,” in Part I — Item 2 of this Form 10-Q and in Part I — Item 1A of Danaher’s 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other than as set forth below, there were no material changes during the quarter ended July 1, 2011 to the risk factors reported in the Company’s 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Our acquisition of Beckman Coulter, Inc. could negatively impact our financial position, profitability and return on invested capital.  In June 2011, Danaher acquired Beckman Coulter, Inc. The acquisition of Beckman Coulter is Danaher’s largest acquisition to date, expands Danaher’s business into new markets and regulatory areas and involves a number of legal, financial, accounting, managerial, operational and other risks and challenges, including the following. Any of these risks and challenges could adversely affect our financial position, profitability and return on invested capital.        •    Beckman Coulter could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable.        •    Beckman Coulter could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.        •    Earnings charges relating to the acquisition of Beckman Coulter could adversely impact our operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period.        •    The integration of Beckman Coulter could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively handle.    41    Table of Contents     •    We could experience difficulty in integrating Beckman Coulter’s personnel, operations and financial and other systems and retaining key employees and customers.        •    We may be unable to achieve the cost savings or other synergies that we anticipate realizing as a result of the acquisition of Beckman Coulter.        •    By acquiring Beckman Coulter we may have assumed unknown liabilities or internal control deficiencies, and the liabilities that we assumed as a result of the acquisition may prove greater than anticipated. Any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.        •    As a result of the acquisition of Beckman Coulter, we have recorded significant goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets.  Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.  Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by comparable agencies of other countries and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials (or the manufacture and sale of products containing such materials). We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance for our new products or modifications to existing products, and if we do such clearance may be time-consuming, costly and restrictive. Violations of these regulations, efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) can lead to warning letters, declining sales, recalls, notices to customers, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. Failure to comply with these or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to manufacture, import and export products and services, disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and damage to our reputation. Compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses. For information regarding recent FDA inspection of certain Beckman Coulter facilities, see “Part II-Item 1 – Legal Proceedings”.  As our Beckman Coulter business previously reported in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and as discussed above in “Part II-Item 1 – Legal Proceedings,” the business is working to obtain updated 510(k) clearances for its troponin test kits available on its Dxl and Access immunoassay instruments. Also as discussed above, Beckman Coulter in 2010 initiated a review of other product modifications where a decision was made not to seek clearance or approval from FDA. Beckman Coulter is also continuing to evaluate its internal processes and procedures regarding quality systems and product quality matters. As part of these reviews, Beckman Coulter has identified corrective actions that need to be made and may identify further required corrective actions, any of which could impact other products and adversely affect the business’ operating results. Our ability to obtain in a timely manner any necessary 510(k) clearances for troponin or any other products for which 510(k) approval is required will depend on many factors, including our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results. Therefore, we can provide no assurance that the necessary clearance or approvals will be obtained within the timeframe anticipated, if at all. Furthermore, the process for obtaining 510(k) clearances for any new or modified products could be lengthy and costly, could change over time, may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained and may result in the initiation of enforcement actions against us by FDA, including recalls, warning letters and other adverse actions as described above. Domestic and foreign revenue derived from products that are the subject of FDA inquiries or enforcement actions could decline, such revenue declines could be more than we estimate and we may lose customers as a result of these issues.  We are subject to laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our    42    Table of Contents  reputation, financial condition and results of operations.  We are subject to various laws regulating (1) fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, and (2) the privacy and security of health information, including the federal regulations described below. Many states and foreign countries have also adopted laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, such federal regulations.        •    The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.        •    The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) prohibits knowingly and willfully (1) executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or (2) falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), also mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information and requires us to report certain breaches of unsecured, individually identifiable health information.        •    The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery.  Failure to comply with these or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to manufacture, import and export products and services, disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and damage to our reputation. Compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses.  The healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, which could adversely affect our revenues and profits.  The healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, including the following:        •    Many of our customers rely on government funding for healthcare products and services and research activities. The recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), healthcare austerity measures in Europe and other potential healthcare reform changes and government austerity measures may reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services. Global economic uncertainty can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.        •    Beginning in 2013, the PPACA will also impose a 2.3% deductible excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States as well as new reporting and disclosure requirements on medical device manufacturers.        •    Healthcare providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of healthcare services, and healthcare providers are increasingly consolidating and forming group purchasing organizations to improve their purchasing leverage.  These changes may cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement available for our products services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services and increase our tax liabilities and other costs. In addition, we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us,    43    Table of Contents  and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.  ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
