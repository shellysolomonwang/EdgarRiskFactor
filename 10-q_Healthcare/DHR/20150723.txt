ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIn addition to the risks identified below, information regarding risk factors appears in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Information Related to Forward-Looking Statements,” in Part I - Item 2 of this Form 10-Q and in Part I - Item 1A of Danaher’s 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other than as set forth below, there were no material changes during the quarter ended July 3, 2015 to the risk factors reported in the Company’s 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our anticipated acquisition of Pall may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline, or at all, and if completed could negatively impact our financial position, profitability and return on invested capital.We have signed a definitive merger agreement with Pall pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pall and Pall will become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Danaher. The proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline, or at all. If consummated, the acquisition of Pall will expand Danaher’s business into new markets and regulatory areas and involve a number of legal, financial, accounting, managerial, operational and other risks and challenges, including the following. Any of these risks and challenges could adversely affect our financial position, profitability and return on invested capital.•Pall could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we pay for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable.•Pall could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.•Earnings charges relating to the acquisition of Pall could adversely impact our operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period.•The integration of Pall could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively manage.•We could experience difficulty in integrating Pall’s personnel, operations and financial and other systems and retaining key employees and customers.•We may be unable to achieve the cost savings or other synergies that we anticipate realizing as a result of the acquisition of Pall.•By acquiring Pall we may assume unknown liabilities or internal control deficiencies, and the liabilities that we assume as a result of the acquisition may prove greater than anticipated. Any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.•As a result of the acquisition of Pall, we expect to record significant goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets.We are pursuing a plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies. The proposed separation may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits. In May 2015, we announced a plan to separate into two independent public companies by the end of 2016 through a spin-off of certain of our businesses. Unanticipated developments, including possible delays in obtaining various tax rulings, regulatory approvals or clearances and trade qualifications, uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes, could delay or prevent the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable and/or different than expected. Even if the transaction is completed, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spin-off. Expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed separation may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate. Executing the proposed separation also requires significant time and attention from management, which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business. Following the proposed separation, the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.39Table of ContentsITEM 2.
