ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSExcept as set forth below, there were no material changes during the quarter ended March 29, 2019 to the risk factors reported in the Company’s 2018 Annual Report. Additional information regarding risk factors can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Information Related to Forward-Looking Statements,” in Part I—Item 2 of this Form 10-Q and in Part I—Item 1A of the Company’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We may not complete the GE Biopharma Acquisition within the time frame we anticipate or at all; any regulatory approval of the GE Biopharma Acquisition may be subject to conditions; and the GE Biopharma Acquisition could negatively impact our business, financial statements and stock price.The GE Biopharma Acquisition discussed above would constitute Danaher’s largest acquisition to date based on purchase price, would expand Danaher’s business into new segments and involves a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following. Any of these risks or challenges could adversely affect our business, financial statements and stock price.•If the GE Biopharma Acquisition is not completed on the anticipated timetable or at all, or if regulatory approval of the acquisition is subject to conditions, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the GE Biopharma Acquisition on the anticipated timetable or at all.•The GE Biopharma Business could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we pay or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable, or we could fail to operate such business profitably.•The GE Biopharma Acquisition could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.•Pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges related to the GE Biopharma Acquisition could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period-to-period.•The GE Biopharma Acquisition could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.•The GE Biopharma Acquisition could divert management’s attention and other resources, which could have a negative impact on our ability to manage existing operations or pursue other strategic transactions.•We could experience difficulty or greater-than-anticipated costs in integrating the personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems of GE Biopharma, and could experience difficulty attracting and retaining key employees and customers.•We may be unable to achieve anticipated cost savings or other synergies on the timetable we expect or at all.•We may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from GE Biopharma’s activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.•The GE Biopharma Purchase Agreement includes provisions relating to purchase price adjustments, which may have unpredictable financial results.•As a result of the GE Biopharma Acquisition, we expect to record significant goodwill and other assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur impairment charges.We have outstanding debt, and our debt will increase as a result of the GE Biopharma Acquisition. Our existing and future indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings; and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.43Table of ContentsAs of March 29, 2019, we had approximately $9.5 billion in outstanding indebtedness and had the ability to incur approximately an additional approximately $1.7 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facility based on the amounts available under the Company’s $4.0 billion Credit Facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. We expect to incur up to approximately $18 billion of additional indebtedness to fund a portion of the purchase price of the GE Biopharma Acquisition.Our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and other investments; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates.We anticipate that the additional indebtedness we expect to incur in connection with the GE Biopharma Acquisition will likely result in a negative change to our credit ratings and a potential downgrading compared to our credit rating prior to the public announcement of the GE Biopharma Acquisition. This anticipated reduction in our credit ratings will limit our ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that have been available to us prior to the GE Biopharma Acquisition. If our credit ratings are further downgraded or put on watch for a further potential downgrade, we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts, at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained.Our current revolving credit facility and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets, and a requirement under the revolving credit facility to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders’ equity) of 0.65 to 1.0 or less. If we breach any of these restrictions and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders on favorable terms, subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.If we add new debt in the future, the risks described above would increase.We intend to conduct an initial public offering of shares of our Dental business in the second half of 2019. Subsequent to the initial public offering, we intend to distribute our remaining equity interest in the Dental business in one or more spin-off and/or split-off transactions, and in addition to or in lieu of such transactions may sell additional shares of the Dental business in one or more publicly registered offerings or private placements. Any or all of these transactions may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits.In July 2018, the Company announced its intention to spin-off its Dental business into an independent publicly-traded company. On February 25, 2019, in connection with the announcement of the GE Biopharma Acquisition, the Company also announced a modification of its plans with respect to the Dental business, specifically that it now intends to conduct an initial public offering of shares of the Dental business in the second half of 2019, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining final approval from the Danaher Board of Directors, receipt of favorable rulings from the IRS and receipt of other receipt of regulatory approvals. Subsequent to the Dental IPO, we intend to distribute our remaining equity interest in the Dental business in one or more spin-off and/or split-off transactions, and in addition to or in lieu of such transactions may sell additional shares of the Dental business in one or more publicly registered offerings or private placements.Unanticipated developments, including adverse market conditions, possible delays in obtaining various tax rulings, regulatory approvals or clearances, uncertainty of the financial markets or changes in the Company’s cash requirements, business performance and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes, could delay or prevent the proposed Dental IPO and/or any of the other potential transactions described above, or cause the proposed Dental IPO and/or any of the other potential transactions described above to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable and/or different than expected. Even if these transactions are completed, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits therefrom. Expenses incurred to accomplish these transactions may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate. Executing the proposed separation also requires significant time and attention from management, which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business. We cannot assure you that the Dental IPO and the other transactions described above, if consummated, will yield greater, net benefits to Danaher and its shareholders than if the Dental IPO and other transactions described above had not occurred. 44Table of ContentsITEM 2.
