Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 contains a detailed discussion of risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. The risk factor described below is in addition to those risk factors.  The recently announced proposed spin-off of Baxter’s biopharmaceutical business may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the intended results.  On March 27, 2014, Baxter announced plans to create two separate, independent global healthcare companies – one focused on developing and marketing innovative biopharmaceuticals and the other on life-saving medical products – through a tax-free distribution to Baxter shareholders of publicly traded stock in the new biopharmaceuticals company, which is expected to be completed by mid-year 2015. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect this proposed spin-off, including but not limited to disruptions in general market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory, tax and works council approvals or clearances. In addition, consummation of the proposed spin-off will require final approval from our Board of Directors. Therefore, we cannot assure that we will be able to complete the spin-off on the terms or on the timeline that we announced, if at all.  We will incur significant expenses in connection with the spin-off. In addition, completion of the proposed spin-off will require significant amounts of management’s time and effort which may divert management’s attention from other aspects of our business operations. Further, if the spin-off is completed, it may not achieve the intended results. Any such difficulties could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.    40    Table of Contents   Item 2.
