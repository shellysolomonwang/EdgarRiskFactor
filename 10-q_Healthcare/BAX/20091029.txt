Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 for additional discussion of regulatory matters.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  Refer to Note 4 for disclosures provided in connection with new accounting standards related derivatives and hedging activities and the fair value of financial instruments. Refer to Note 2 for disclosures provided in connection with new accounting standards related to collaborative arrangements and variable interest entities (VIEs).  On January 1, 2009, the company adopted a new accounting standard which changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of significant respects. The key changes include the expansion of transactions that will qualify as business combinations, the capitalization of IPR&D as an indefinite-lived asset, the recognition of certain acquired contingent assets and liabilities at fair value, the expensing of acquisition costs, the expensing of costs associated with restructuring the acquired company, the recognition of contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date, and the recognition of post-acquisition date changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties as income tax expense or benefit. This standard was applicable for acquisitions made by the company on or after January 1, 2009, including the April 2009 consolidation of SIGMA and the August 2009 asset acquisition of Edwards CRRT. Refer to Note 2 for further information regarding SIGMA and Edwards CRRT.  On January 1, 2009, the company adopted a new accounting standard which changes the accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests (historically referred to as minority interests). The standard requires that noncontrolling interests be presented in the consolidated balance sheets within equity, but separate from Baxter shareholders’ equity, and that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to Baxter and to the noncontrolling interests be clearly identified and presented in the consolidated statements of income. Any losses in excess of the noncontrolling interest’s equity interest continue to be allocated to the noncontrolling interest. Purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Upon a loss of control the interest sold, as well as any interest retained,  32       is measured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. In partial acquisitions, when control is obtained, 100% of the assets and liabilities, including goodwill, are recognized at fair value as if the entire target company had been acquired. The new standard has been applied prospectively as of January 1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which have been applied retrospectively for prior periods presented. Prior to the adoption of the new standard, the noncontrolling interests’ share of net income was included in other expense, net in the consolidated statement of income and the noncontrolling interests’ equity was included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.  In December 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standard that expands the disclosure requirements relating to pension and other postretirement benefits. The standard requires enhanced disclosures about how investment allocation decisions are made and the investment policies and strategies that support those decisions, major categories of plan assets, the input and valuation techniques used in measuring plan assets at fair value, and significant concentrations of credit risk within plan assets. The company will include the disclosures required by this standard beginning with its 2009 year-end consolidated financial statements.  In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard relating to the accounting for transfers of financial assets. The new standard eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity and clarifies existing GAAP as it relates to determining whether a transferor has surrendered control over transferred financial assets. The standard limits the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire original financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated with the transferor in the financial statements presented and/or when the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset. The standard also requires enhanced disclosures about transfers of financial assets and a transferor’s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets. It is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after November 15, 2009, with early adoption prohibited. The new standard will be applied prospectively, except for the disclosure requirements, which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The new standard, which is effective for the company on January 1, 2010, is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.  In June 2009, the FASB issued a new standard that changes the consolidation model for VIEs. The new standard requires an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The standard requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The standard expands the disclosure requirements for enterprises with a variable interest in a VIE. It is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after November 15, 2009, with early adoption prohibited. The company is in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard, which will be adopted by the company at the beginning of 2010.  In October 2009, the FASB issued two updates to the Accounting Standards Codification relating to revenue recognition. The first update eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements in an arrangement with multiple deliverables have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before revenue can be recognized for items that have been delivered. The update also no longer allows use of the residual method when allocating consideration to deliverables. Instead, arrangement consideration is to be allocated to deliverables using the relative selling price method, applying a selling price hierarchy. Vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price should be used if it exists. Otherwise, third party evidence (TPE) of selling price should be used. If neither VSOE nor TPE is available, the company’s best estimate of selling price should be used. The second update eliminates tangible products from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance when the tangible products contain software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the tangible products’ essential functionality. Both updates require expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures and are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with prospective application for new or materially modified arrangements or retrospective application permitted. Early adoption is permitted. The same transition method and period of adoption must be used for both updates. The company is in the process of analyzing the impact of these updates.  33       FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION  This quarterly report includes forward-looking statements, including statements with respect to accounting estimates and assumptions, future litigation outcomes, the company’s efforts to remediate its infusion pumps and other regulatory matters, expectations with respect to restructuring programs, strategic plans, product mix, promotional efforts, geographic expansion, sales and pricing forecasts, expectations with respect to business development activities, potential developments with respect to credit and credit ratings, estimates of liabilities, ongoing tax audits and related tax provisions, deferred tax assets, future pension plan expense, the company’s hedging policy and expectations with respect to the company’s exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk, the company’s internal R&D pipeline, future capital and R&D expenditures, the sufficiency of the company’s financial flexibility and the adequacy of credit facilities and reserves, the effective tax rate in 2009, and all other statements that do not relate to historical facts.

Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements.  34          Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Currency Risk  The company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities, forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar and certain Latin American currencies. The company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In addition, the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange. Gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and equity volatility relating to foreign exchange.  The company uses options, forwards and cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities. The maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at September 30, 2009 is 15 months. The company also enters into undesignated derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and third-party receivables and payables in foreign currencies. The recent financial market and currency volatility may reduce the benefits of the company’s natural hedges and limit the company’s ability to cost-effectively hedge these exposures.  As part of its risk-management program, the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible near-term movements in foreign exchange rates.  A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option, forward and cross-currency swap contracts outstanding at September 30, 2009, while not predictive in nature, indicated that if the U.S. Dollar uniformly fluctuated unfavorably by 10% against all currencies, on a net-of-tax basis, the net liability balance of $73 million, which principally relates to a hedge of U.S. Dollar-denominated debt issued by a foreign subsidiary, would increase by $76 million.  The sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option, forward and cross-currency swap contracts outstanding at September 30, 2009 by replacing the actual exchange rates at September 30, 2009 with exchange rates that are 10% unfavorable to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency. All other factors are held constant. These sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency. The analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances.  Currency restrictions enacted in Venezuela require Baxter to obtain approval from the Venezuelan government to exchange Venezuelan Bolivars for U.S. Dollars at the official exchange rate established by the government. Inflation in Venezuela has continued to increase over the past few years while there has been no change to the official exchange rate established by the government. If Venezuela is designated as a highly inflationary economy and there is a devaluation of the official exchange rate, the financial results of the company could be negatively impacted. As of September 30, 2009, the company’s subsidiary in Venezuela had cash of $45 million and accounts receivable of $19 million denominated in the Venezuelan Bolivar. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, net sales in Venezuela represented less than 1% of Baxter’s total net sales.  Interest Rate and Other Risks  Refer to the caption “Interest Rate and Other Risks” in the “Financial Instrument Market Risk” section of the company’s 2008 Annual Report. There were no significant changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2009.  35          Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Baxter carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Disclosure Committee and management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of Baxter’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of September 30, 2009. Baxter’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Baxter in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and its Board of Directors to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2009.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There has been no change in Baxter’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Baxter’s internal control over financial reporting.  36          Review by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  Reviews of the interim condensed consolidated financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 have been performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm. Its report on the interim condensed consolidated financial information follows. This report is not considered a report within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore, the independent accountants’ liability under Section 11 does not extend to it.  37          Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Baxter International Inc.:  We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Baxter International Inc. and its subsidiaries as of September 30, 2009, and the related condensed consolidated statements of income for each of the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the company’s management.  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income for the year then ended, and in our report dated February 19, 2009, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements referred to above are not presented herein. As discussed in Note 1 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the company changed its method of accounting and reporting for noncontrolling interests. The accompanying December 31, 2008 condensed consolidated balance sheet reflects this change.  /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Chicago, Illinois October 29, 2009  38          PART II.
