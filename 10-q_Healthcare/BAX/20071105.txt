Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 for additional discussion of regulatory matters.  29    Table of Contents  ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SFAS No. 157  In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157), which clarifies the definition of fair value whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. Specifically, the standard clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. SFAS No. 157 does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances, and must be applied on a prospective basis except in certain cases. The standard also requires expanded financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements, including disclosure of the methods used and the effect on earnings. The company is in the process of analyzing this new standard, which will be effective for the company on January 1, 2008.  SFAS No. 159  In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, which are not otherwise currently required to be measured at fair value. Under SFAS No. 159, the decision to measure items at fair value is made at specified election dates on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable. Entities electing the fair value option would be required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings and to expense upfront costs and fees associated with the item for which the fair value option is elected. At the adoption date, unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. The company is in the process of analyzing this new standard, which will be effective for the company on January 1, 2008.

Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements.  31    Table of Contents     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Currency Risk  Refer to the caption “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in the company’s 2006 Annual Report. As part of its risk-management program, the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible near-term movements in foreign exchange rates.  A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2007, while not predictive in nature, indicated that if the U.S. Dollar uniformly fluctuated unfavorably by 10% against all currencies, on a net-of-tax basis, the net liability balance of $39 million with respect to those contracts would increase by $47 million.  With respect to the company’s cross-currency swap agreements (including the outstanding mirror swaps), if the U.S. Dollar uniformly weakened by 10%, on a net-of-tax basis, the net liability balance of $338 million with respect to those contracts outstanding at September 30, 2007 would increase by $83 million. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of cross-currency swap agreements designated as hedges of the net assets of foreign operations relating to changes in spot currency exchange rates is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets relating to changes in spot currency exchange rates. With respect to the portion of the cross-currency swap portfolio that is no longer designated as a net investment hedge, but is fixed via the mirror swaps, as the fair value of this fixed portion of the portfolio decreases, the fair value of the mirror swaps increases by an approximately offsetting amount, and vice versa.  The sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts outstanding at September 30, 2007 by replacing the actual exchange rates at September 30, 2007 with exchange rates that are 10% unfavorable to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency. All other factors are held constant. These sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency. The analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances.  Interest Rate and Other Risks  Refer to the caption “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in the company’s 2006 Annual Report. There were no significant changes during the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2007.  32    Table of Contents     Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Baxter carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Disclosure Committee and management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of Baxter’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of September 30, 2007. Baxter’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Baxter in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis and that such information is communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and its Board of Directors to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2007.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There has been no change in Baxter’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2007 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Baxter’s internal control over financial reporting.  33    Table of Contents     Review by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  Reviews of the interim condensed consolidated financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, have been performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm. Its report on the interim condensed consolidated financial information follows. This report is not considered a report within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore, the independent accountants’ liability under Section 11 does not extend to it.  34    Table of Contents     Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Baxter International Inc.:  We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Baxter International Inc. and its subsidiaries as of September 30, 2007, and the related condensed consolidated statements of income for each of the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2007 and 2006. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income for the year then ended, and in our report dated February 27, 2007, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements referred to above are not presented herein. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.                /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP                PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP       Chicago, Illinois November 5, 2007       35    Table of Contents                   PART II.
