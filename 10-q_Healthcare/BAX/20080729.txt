Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 for additional discussion of regulatory matters.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SFAS No. 161  In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (SFAS No. 161). The standard expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and requires qualitative disclosures about the objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about the fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. The company is in the process of analyzing this new standard, which will be effective for the company in the first quarter of 2009.  SFAS No. 160  In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51” (SFAS No. 160). The new standard changes the accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests, which have historically been referred to as minority interests. SFAS No. 160 requires that noncontrolling interests be presented in the consolidated balance sheets within shareholders’ equity, but separate from the parent’s equity, and that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented in the consolidated statements of income. Any losses in excess of the noncontrolling interest’s equity interest will continue to be allocated to the noncontrolling interest. Purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change of control will be accounted for as equity transactions. Upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be measured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. In partial acquisitions, when control is obtained, the acquiring company will recognize, at fair value, 100% of the assets and liabilities, including goodwill, as if the entire target company had been acquired. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. The new standard will be applied prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The company is in the process of analyzing the standard, which will be adopted by the company at the beginning of 2009.  SFAS No. 141-R  In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141-R). The new standard changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of significant respects. The key changes include the expansion of transactions that will qualify as business combinations, the capitalization of in-process research and development as an indefinite-lived asset, the recognition of certain acquired contingent assets and liabilities at fair value, the expensing of acquisition costs, the expensing of costs associated with restructuring the acquired company, the recognition of contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date, and the recognition of post-acquisition date changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties as income tax expense or benefit. SFAS No. 141-R is effective for business combinations that close in  26    Table of Contents  years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. The company is in the process of analyzing this new standard, which will be adopted by the company at the beginning of 2009.  SFAS No. 157  In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157), which clarifies the definition of fair value whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. Specifically, the standard clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. SFAS No. 157 does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances, and must be applied on a prospective basis except in certain cases. The standard also requires expanded financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements, including disclosure of the methods used and the effect on earnings.  In February 2008, FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS No. 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (FSP No. 157-2) was issued. FSP No. 157-2 defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years, for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). Examples of items within the scope of FSP No. 157-2 are nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination (but not measured at fair value in subsequent periods), and long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets measured at fair value for an impairment assessment under SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”  The partial adoption of SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008 with respect to financial assets and financial liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 5 for the fair value measurement disclosures for these assets and liabilities. The company is in the process of analyzing the potential impact of SFAS No. 157 relating to its planned January 1, 2009 adoption of the remainder of the standard.

Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements.  28    Table of Contents     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Currency Risk  The company uses derivative instruments to hedge the foreign currency risk to earnings relating to certain firm commitments, forecasted transactions, intercompany and third-party receivables, payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies. The company has also historically hedged certain of its net investments in international affiliates, using a combination of debt denominated in foreign currencies and cross-currency swap agreements. Gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce earnings and shareholders’ equity volatility relating to foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to the caption “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in the company’s 2007 Annual Report for further information.  As part of its risk-management program, the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible near-term movements in foreign exchange rates.  A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange hedge contracts outstanding at June 30, 2008, while not predictive in nature, indicated that if the U.S. Dollar uniformly fluctuated unfavorably by 10% against all currencies, on a net-of-tax basis, the net liability balance of $65 million, which principally related to a hedge of U.S. Dollar-denominated debt issued by a foreign subsidiary, would increase by $82 million.  With respect to the company’s net investment hedges, if the U.S. Dollar uniformly weakened by 10%, on a net-of-tax basis, the liability balance of $170 million with respect to those contracts outstanding at June 30, 2008 would increase by $47 million. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of the net investment hedge contracts is almost entirely offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets.  The sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign currency option, forward and cross-currency swap contracts outstanding at June 30, 2008 by replacing the actual exchange rates at June 30, 2008 with exchange rates that are 10% unfavorable to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency. All other factors are held constant. These sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency. The analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances.  Interest Rate and Other Risks  Refer to the caption “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in the company’s 2007 Annual Report. There were no significant changes during the quarter ended June 30, 2008.  29    Table of Contents     Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Baxter carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Disclosure Committee and management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of Baxter’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of June 30, 2008. Baxter’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Baxter in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis and that such information is communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and its Board of Directors to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2008.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There has been no change in Baxter’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 30, 2008 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Baxter’s internal control over financial reporting.  30    Table of Contents     Review by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  Reviews of the interim condensed consolidated financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively, have been performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm. Its report on the interim condensed consolidated financial information follows. This report is not considered a report within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore, the independent accountants’ liability under Section 11 does not extend to it.  31    Table of Contents     Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Baxter International Inc.:  We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Baxter International Inc. and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2008, and the related condensed consolidated statements of income for each of the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2008 and 2007. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income for the year then ended, and in our report dated February 26, 2008, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements referred to above are not presented herein. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.  /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Chicago, Illinois July 28, 2008  32    Table of Contents     PART II.
