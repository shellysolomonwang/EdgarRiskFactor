Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 for additional discussion of regulatory matters.  25    Table of Contents  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SFAS No. 160  On January 1, 2009, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51” (SFAS No. 160). The new standard changed the accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests, which have historically been referred to as minority interests. SFAS No. 160 requires that noncontrolling interests be presented in the consolidated balance sheets within equity, but separate from Baxter shareholders’ equity, and that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to Baxter and to the noncontrolling interests be clearly identified and presented in the consolidated statements of income. Any losses in excess of the noncontrolling interest’s equity interest will continue to be allocated to the noncontrolling interest. Purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change of control will be accounted for as equity transactions. Upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be measured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. In partial acquisitions, when control is obtained, Baxter recognizes, at fair value, 100% of the assets and liabilities, including goodwill, as if the entire target company had been acquired. The new standard has been applied prospectively as of January 1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which have been applied retrospectively for prior periods presented. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 160, the noncontrolling interests’ share of net income was included in other expense (income), net in the consolidated statement of income and the noncontrolling interests’ equity was included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.  FSP FAS No. 132(R)-1  In December 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS No. 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets” (FSP FAS No. 132(R)-1). This FSP expands the disclosure requirements relating to pension and other postretirement benefits to require enhanced disclosures about how investment allocation decisions are made and the investment policies and strategies that support those decisions, major categories of plan assets, the input and valuation techniques used in measuring plan assets at fair value, and significant concentrations of credit risk within plan assets. The company will include the disclosures required by this standard beginning with its 2009 year-end consolidated financial statements.  26    Table of Contents  FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION  This quarterly report includes forward-looking statements, including statements with respect to accounting estimates and assumptions, future litigation outcomes, the company’s efforts to remediate its infusion pumps and other regulatory matters, expectations with respect to restructuring programs (including expected cost savings), strategic plans, product mix, promotional efforts, geographic expansion, sales and pricing forecasts, expectations with respect to business development activities, potential developments with respect to credit and credit ratings, estimates of liabilities, ongoing tax audits and related tax provisions, deferred tax assets, future pension plan expense, the company’s hedging policy and expectations with respect to the company’s exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk, the company’s internal R&D pipeline, future capital and R&D expenditures, the sufficiency of the company’s financial flexibility and the adequacy of credit facilities and reserves, the effective tax rate in 2009, expected revenues from the Fenwal transition services agreements, and all other statements that do not relate to historical facts.

Risk Factors” in the company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, all of which are available on the company’s website.    Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements.  27    Table of Contents     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Currency Risk  The company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities, forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar and certain Latin American currencies. The company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In addition, the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange. Gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and equity volatility relating to foreign exchange.  The company uses options, forwards and cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities. The maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at March 31, 2009 is 15 months. The company also enters into undesignated derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and third-party receivables and payables in foreign currencies. The recent financial market and currency volatility may reduce the benefits of the company’s natural hedges and limit the company’s ability to cost-effectively hedge these exposures.  As part of its risk-management program, the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible near-term movements in foreign exchange rates.  A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option, forward and cross-currency swap contracts outstanding at March 31, 2009, while not predictive in nature, indicated that if the U.S. Dollar uniformly fluctuated unfavorably by 10% against all currencies, on a net-of-tax basis, the net asset balance of $23 million, which principally relates to hedges of Euro forecasted transactions partially offset by U.S. Dollar-denominated debt issued by a foreign subsidiary, would decrease by $79 million, resulting in a net liability position.  The sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option, forward and cross-currency swap contracts outstanding at March 31, 2009 by replacing the actual exchange rates at March 31, 2009 with exchange rates that are 10% unfavorable to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency. All other factors are held constant. These sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency. The analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances.  Interest Rate and Other Risks  Refer to the caption “Interest Rate and Other Risks” in the “Financial Instrument Market Risk” section of the company’s 2008 Annual Report. There were no significant changes during the quarter ended March 31, 2009.  28    Table of Contents     Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Baxter carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Disclosure Committee and management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of Baxter’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of March 31, 2009. Baxter’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Baxter in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis and that such information is communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and its Board of Directors to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2009.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There has been no change in Baxter’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Baxter’s internal control over financial reporting.  29    Table of Contents     Review by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  Reviews of the interim condensed consolidated financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 have been performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm. Its report on the interim condensed consolidated financial information follows. This report is not considered a report within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore, the independent accountants’ liability under Section 11 does not extend to it.  30    Table of Contents     Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Baxter International Inc.:  We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Baxter International Inc. and its subsidiaries as of March 31, 2009, and the related condensed consolidated statements of income for each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2009 and 2008. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the company’s management.  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income for the year then ended, and in our report dated February 19, 2009, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements referred to above are not presented herein. As discussed in Note 1 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the company changed its method of accounting and reporting for noncontrolling interests. The accompanying December 31, 2008 condensed consolidated balance sheet reflects this change.  /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Chicago, Illinois May 5, 2009  31    Table of Contents     PART II.
