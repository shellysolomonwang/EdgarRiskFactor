Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 for additional discussion of regulatory matters.  30       FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION  This quarterly report includes forward-looking statements, including statements with respect to accounting estimates and assumptions, including those made in connection with the charges related to the recall of the company’s COLLEAGUE infusion pumps, litigation related matters including outcomes, the company’s efforts to recall and remediate its COLLEAGUE infusion pumps and other regulatory matters, expectations with respect to restructuring and cost optimization programs (including expected cost savings), strategic plans, geographic expansion, credit exposure to foreign governments, expectations with respect to business development activities, expectations with respect to volatility in results for certain plasma-based therapies, estimates of liabilities, expectations with respect to the company’s hedging activities including its exposure to financial market volatility and foreign currency risk, the company’s internal R&D pipeline, future capital, R&D and marketing and administrative expenditures, expectations with respect to the impact of healthcare reform legislation, the sufficiency of the company’s financial flexibility and the adequacy of credit facilities and reserves, repurchases of the company’s common stock, the effective tax rate in 2010, and all other statements that do not relate to historical facts. The statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including assumptions concerning:       •   demand for and market acceptance risks for new and existing products, such as ADVATE and plasma-based therapies (including Antibody Therapy), and other therapies;        •   fluctuations in supply and demand and the pricing of plasma-based therapies;        •   recently enacted healthcare reform legislation in the United States including its effect on pricing, reimbursement, taxation and rebate policies;        •   future actions of governmental authorities and other third parties including third party payers as recently adopted healthcare reform legislation is implemented in the United States;        •   additional legislation, regulation and other governmental pressures in the United States or globally, which may affect pricing, reimbursement, taxation and rebate policies of government agencies and private payers or other elements of the company’s business;        •   the company’s ability to identify business development and growth opportunities for existing products;        •   product quality or patient safety issues, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, launch delays, sanctions, seizures, litigation, or declining sales;        •   future actions of the FDA or any other regulatory body or government authority that could delay, limit or suspend product development, manufacturing or sale or result in seizures, injunctions, monetary sanctions or criminal or civil liabilities, including any sanctions available under the Consent Decree entered into with the FDA concerning the COLLEAGUE and SYNDEO infusion pumps;        •   implementation of the FDA’s final July 2010 order to recall all of the company’s COLLEAGUE infusion pumps currently in use in the United States as well as any additional actions required globally;        •   the company’s ability to fulfill demand for its SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion pump as a result of the recall of its COLLEAGUE infusion pumps currently in use in the United States;        •   foreign currency fluctuations, particularly due to reduced benefits from the company’s natural hedges and limitations on the ability to cost-effectively hedge resulting from financial market and currency volatility;        •   product development risks, including satisfactory clinical performance, the ability to manufacture at appropriate scale, and the general unpredictability associated with the product development cycle;        •   the ability to enforce the company’s patent rights or patents of third parties preventing or restricting the company’s manufacture, sale or use of affected products or technology;        •   the impact of geographic and product mix on the company’s sales;        •   the impact of competitive products and pricing, including generic competition, drug reimportation and disruptive technologies;        •   inventory reductions or fluctuations in buying patterns by wholesalers or distributors;        •   the availability and pricing of acceptable raw materials and component supply;        •   global regulatory, trade and tax policies;        •   any changes in law concerning the taxation of income, including income earned outside the United States;        •   actions by tax authorities in connection with ongoing tax audits;        •   the company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of restructuring and optimization initiatives;        •   the company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from its joint product development and commercialization arrangements, including the SIGMA transaction;        •   changes in credit agency ratings;        •   any impact of the commercial and credit environment on the company and its customers and suppliers; and        •   other factors identified elsewhere in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those factors described under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, all of which are available on the company’s website.    Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements.  31                  Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Currency Risk  The company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities, forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Colombian Peso. The company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In addition, the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange. Gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and shareholders’ equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. Financial market and currency volatility may reduce the benefits of the company’s natural hedges and limit the company’s ability to cost-effectively hedge these exposures.  The company uses options, forwards and cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities. The maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at June 30, 2010 is 18 months. The company also uses derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and third-party receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies.  Currency restrictions enacted in Venezuela require Baxter to obtain approval from the Venezuelan government to exchange Venezuelan Bolivars for U.S. Dollars and requires such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate. As of January 1, 2010, Venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under GAAP and as a result, the functional currency of the company’s subsidiary in Venezuela became the U.S. Dollar. The devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar and designation of Venezuela as highly inflationary did not have a material impact on the financial results of the company.  As part of its risk-management program, the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible near-term movements in foreign exchange rates.  A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option, forward and cross-currency swap contracts outstanding at June 30, 2010, while not predictive in nature, indicated that if the U.S. Dollar uniformly fluctuated unfavorably by 10% against all currencies, on a net-of-tax basis, the net asset balance of $13 million with respect to those contracts would decrease by $66 million, resulting in a net liability balance.  The sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option, forward and cross-currency swap contracts outstanding at June 30, 2010 by replacing the actual exchange rates at June 30, 2010 with exchange rates that are 10% unfavorable to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency. All other factors are held constant. These sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency. The analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances.  Interest Rate and Other Risks  Refer to the caption “Interest Rate and Other Risks” in the “Financial Instrument Market Risk” section of the company’s 2009 Annual Report. There were no significant changes during the quarter ended June 30, 2010.  32                  Item 4.   Controls and Procedures    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Baxter carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Disclosure Committee and management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of Baxter’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of June 30, 2010.  Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2010.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  In the second quarter of 2010, the company began the implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system. In addition, the company is consolidating and outsourcing certain computer operations and application support activities. These multi-year initiatives will be conducted in phases and include modifications to the design and operation of controls over financial reporting. The company is testing internal controls over financial reporting for design effectiveness prior to implementation of each phase, and has monitoring controls in place over the implementation of these changes. There have been no other changes in Baxter’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 30, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Baxter’s internal control over financial reporting.  33          Review by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  Reviews of the interim condensed consolidated financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 have been performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm. Its report on the interim condensed consolidated financial information follows. This report is not considered a report within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore, the independent accountants’ liability under Section 11 does not extend to it.  34          Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Baxter International Inc.:  We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Baxter International Inc. and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2010, and the related condensed consolidated statements of income for each of the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the company’s management.  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, of cash flows and of changes in equity and comprehensive income for the year then ended, and in our report dated February 22, 2010, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.  /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Chicago, Illinois August 4, 2010  35          PART II.
