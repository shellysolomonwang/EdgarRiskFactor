Item 1A: Risk Factors" of our 2014 Form 10-K. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.OverviewWe are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies, hospitals and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs, enhancing efficiency and improving quality. We also provide medical products to patients in the home. We report our financial results in two segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical.Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2014 decreased by 2 percent to $24.1 billion due primarily to the previously disclosed expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreen Co. ("Walgreens") on August 31, 2013, largely offset by sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers.Gross margin increased 6 percent to $1.3 billion reflecting sales growth from existing and new customers and strong performance from our Pharmaceutical segment generic programs, offset in part by the Walgreens contract expiration.Operating earnings decreased 1 percent to $466 million primarily due to litigation charges. Earnings from continuing  operations decreased 22 percent to $266 million primarily due to the previously disclosed $63 million favorable impact in the prior year from the settlement of federal and state tax controversies. Our cash and equivalents balance was $2.5 billion at September 30, 2014 compared to $2.9 billion at June 30, 2014. The decrease in cash and equivalents during the quarter was driven by cash deployed for share repurchases of $360 million and dividends of $119 million, net of cash provided by operating activities of $61 million.Joint Venture With CVS Health CorporationIn July 2014, we established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC (“Red Oak Sourcing”), a U.S.-based generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity with CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”) with an initial term of 10 years. Both companies have contributed sourcing and supply chain expertise to the 50/50 joint venture and have committed to source generic pharmaceuticals through arrangements negotiated by it. Red Oak Sourcing negotiates generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of both companies, but does not own products or hold inventory on behalf of either company. We are required to pay 39 quarterly payments of $25.6 million to CVS commencing in October 2014 and, only if certain milestones are achieved, to pay additional predetermined amounts to CVS beginning in fiscal 2016. The fixed payments of $25.6 million will be expensed evenly commencing during the second quarter of fiscal 2015. No physical assets were contributed by either company to Red Oak Sourcing, and minimal funding has been provided to capitalize the entity.Results of OperationsRevenue Three Months Ended September 30 (in millions)2014 2013 ChangePharmaceutical$21,209 $21,813 (3)%Medical2,852 2,711 5 %Total segment revenue24,061 24,524 (2)%Corporate9 (1) N.M.Total revenue$24,070 $24,523 (2)%Pharmaceutical SegmentRevenue for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the prior-year period was negatively impacted by the Walgreens contract expiration ($3.3 billion).

The net impact of these factors increased gross margin by $66 million.Gross margin rate, apart from the Walgreens contract expiration, was flat during the three months ended September 30, 2014.

Gross margin rate was positively impacted by strong performance from generic programs and was adversely impacted by customer pricing changes.Medical Segment ProfitThe principal drivers for the increase in Medical segment profit during the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the prior-year period were positive contribution from our Cardinal Health brand products and service offerings offset by reduced contribution from national brand products.Consolidated Operating EarningsIn addition to revenue, gross margin and SG&A expenses discussed above, operating earnings were impacted by the following: Three Months Ended September 30  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangeRestructuring and employee severance$19 $11 N.M.Amortization and other acquisition-related costs53 49 N.M.Impairments and loss on disposal of assets— — N.M.Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net28 1 N.M.Restructuring and Employee SeveranceThe majority of restructuring costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 related to restructuring activities within our Medical segment.Amortization and Other Acquisition-Related CostsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $44 million and $45 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Litigation (Recoveries)/Charges, NetDuring the three months ended September 30, 2014, we accrued $27 million related to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration investigation and related matters, as discussed further in Note 7 of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements."16Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)Earnings Before Income Taxes and Discontinued OperationsIn addition to the items discussed above, earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following: Three Months Ended September 30  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangeOther income, net$(3) $(4) N.M.Interest expense, net34 33 1%Provision for Income TaxesGenerally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and U.S. state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items. During the three months ended September 30, 2014, the effective tax rate of 38.9 percent was unfavorably impacted by 2.6 percentage points ($11 million) due to the remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits and 2.4 percentage points ($10 million) due to nondeductibility of litigation charges, partially offset by 3.3 percentage points ($14 million) due to adjusting deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances for the impact of Puerto Rico tax law changes enacted during the quarter.During the three months ended September 30, 2013, the effective tax rate of 23.2 percent was impacted by net favorable discrete items of $61 million, which reduced the rate by 13.7 percentage points. The discrete items include the favorable impact of the settlement of federal and state tax controversies ($63 million).Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe currently believe that, based upon available capital resources (cash on hand and access to committed credit facilities) and projected operating cash flow, we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs; currently anticipated capital expenditures, business growth and expansion; contractual obligations; tax payments; and current and projected debt service requirements, dividends and share repurchases. If we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions, depending on the size and timing of such transactions, we may need to access capital in addition to cash on hand and our existing committed credit facilities.Cash and EquivalentsOur cash and equivalents balance was $2.5 billion at September 30, 2014, compared to $2.9 billion at June 30, 2014. At September 30, 2014, our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments.  The decrease in cash and equivalents during the three months ended September 30, 2014 was driven primarily by cash deployed for share repurchases of $360 million and dividends of $119 million, net of cash provided by operating activities of $61 million. Net cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2013 benefited from a significant net working capital decrease as a result of the Walgreens contract expiration.Changes in working capital, which impact operating cash flow, can vary significantly depending on factors such as customer payments of accounts receivable, the timing of inventory purchases and payments to vendors in the regular course of business.The cash and equivalents balance at September 30, 2014 included $447 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation, permanently bringing the money into the United States could trigger U.S. federal, state and local income tax obligations. As a U.S. parent company, we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to U.S. federal income tax through intercompany loans.Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperOn November 3, 2014, we renewed our committed receivables sales facility program through Cardinal Health Funding, LLC through November 3, 2017 and increased the size of the facility from $700 million to $950 million with the inclusion of receivables from the Medical segment. Other sources of liquidity include a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion, backed by the revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2014, we had no outstanding balances or borrowings under these facilities, except for standby letters of credit of $41 million under the committed receivables sales facility program.Our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility program require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio, as of any fiscal quarter end, of at least 4-to-1 and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.25-to-1. As of September 30, 2014, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.Available-for-Sale SecuritiesAt September 30, 2014, we held $91 million of marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale.Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures were $36 million and $26 million during the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.17Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)DividendsOn August 6, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.3425 per share, or $1.37 on an annualized basis, which was paid on October 15, 2014 to shareholders of record on October 1, 2014.On November 5, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.3425 per share, payable on January 15, 2015 to shareholders of record on January 2, 2015.Share RepurchasesDuring the three months ended September 30, 2014, we repurchased $360 million of our common shares. During October 2014, we repurchased $231 million of our common shares. We funded the repurchases with cash on hand. Our Board of Directors has approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, which expires on December 31, 2016. At September 30, 2014, we had $1.4 billion remaining under our repurchase authorization.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements at September 30, 2014. Contractual ObligationsThere have been no material changes, outside of the ordinary course of business, in our outstanding contractual obligations since the end of fiscal 2014 through September 30, 2014.Recent Financial Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 of the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards.Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting EstimatesRefer to the Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates section of "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2014 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates since the end of fiscal 2014 through September 30, 2014.18Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThere have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative market risks since the end of fiscal 2014 through September 30, 2014 from those reported in our 2014 Form 10-K.Item 4: Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) as of September 30, 2014. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2014, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.19Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesPart II. Other InformationItem 1: Legal ProceedingsIn addition to the proceedings described below, the legal proceedings described in Note 7 of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" are incorporated in this "Item 1: Legal Proceedings" by reference. In June 2012, Henry Stanley, Jr., a purported shareholder, filed a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the current and certain former members of our Board of Directors. The complaint alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the DEA's past suspensions of our distribution centers’ registrations to distribute controlled substances. In October 2012, the U.S. District Court dismissed the derivative action with prejudice, and in August 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the decision. In September 2013, the same plaintiff made demand on our Board of Directors to take action against current and certain former members of our Board of Directors based on the allegations made in the derivative action. A special committee of independent directors investigated the allegations made in the demand. After receiving and evaluating the special committee's findings and recommendations, our Board of Directors determined in February 2014 that pursuing the claims set forth in the demand was not in the best interest of the company. In May 2014, another purported shareholder made a similar demand on our Board of Directors, which was referred to the special committee. After receiving and evaluating the special committee's findings and recommendations with respect to this demand, our Board of Directors determined in November 2014 that pursuing the claims set forth in the demand was not in the best interest of the company.Item 1A: Risk FactorsYou should carefully consider the information in this Form 10-Q and the risk factors discussed in "Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors"  and other risks discussed in our 2014 Form 10-K and our filings with the SEC since June 30, 2014. These risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. Our business also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations.Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
