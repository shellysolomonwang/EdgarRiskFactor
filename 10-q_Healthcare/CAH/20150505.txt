Item 1A: Risk Factors" of our 2014 Form 10-K. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.OverviewWe are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies, hospitals and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs, enhancing efficiency and improving quality. We also provide medical products to patients in the home. We report our financial results in two segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical.Revenue for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015 was $25.4 billion and $75.0 billion, an 18 percent  and 10 percent increase, respectively, from the prior-year periods due primarily to sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers. Revenue growth was negatively impacted for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 due to the previously disclosed expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreen Co. ("Walgreens") on August 31, 2013.Gross margin increased 12 percent to $1.5 billion and 9 percent to $4.3 billion for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015, respectively, reflecting sales growth from existing and new customers and strong performance from our Pharmaceutical  segment generic programs, offset in part by customer pricing changes. The increase for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 was partially offset by the Walgreens contract expiration in the prior-year period.Operating earnings increased 16 percent to $591 million and 7 percent to $1.6 billion for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015, respectively, primarily due to the gross margin increase.Earnings from continuing operations increased 16 percent to $365 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015, and decreased 1 percent to $920 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2015. Both periods were impacted by the factors discussed above. The decrease for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 also reflected a $60 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the current year.Our cash and equivalents balance was $3.2 billion at March 31, 2015 and $2.9 billion at June 30, 2014. For the nine months ended March 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.7 billion was partially offset by share repurchases of $684 million and cash dividends of $346 million. In addition, we refinanced $1.2 billion of long-term debt at lower interest rates and longer maturities. CordisOn March 1, 2015, we entered into a binding offer letter with Ethicon, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, to purchase its Cordis business for a purchase price of $1.9 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. The acquisition of Cordis, a manufacturer and distributor of interventional cardiology devices and endovascular solutions, will expand the Medical segment's portfolio of self-manufactured products. We expect to finance the acquisition with $1.0 billion in new long-term debt with the remaining amount funded by cash on hand. In March 2015, we also entered into a $1.0 billion senior unsecured bridge term loan that may be used to complete this acquisition. Cordis is a global company, with operations in more than 50 countries. The acquisition is expected to close in approximately 20 principal countries towards the end of calendar year 2015 and in the remaining countries afterward, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Generic Sourcing Venture With CVS Health CorporationIn July 2014, we established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC ("Red Oak Sourcing"), a U.S.-based generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity with CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”) with an initial term of 10 years. Both companies have contributed sourcing and supply chain expertise to the 50/50 generic sourcing venture and have committed to source generic pharmaceuticals through arrangements negotiated by it. Red Oak Sourcing negotiates generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of both companies, but does not own products or hold inventory on behalf of either company. We are required to pay 39 quarterly 17Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)payments of $25.6 million to CVS which commenced in October 2014. In addition, if certain milestones are achieved, we are required to pay additional predetermined amounts to CVS beginning in fiscal 2016.Results of OperationsRevenue Three Months Ended March 31 (in millions)2015 2014 ChangePharmaceutical$22,605 $18,762 20%Medical2,774 2,657 4%Total segment revenue25,379 21,419 18%Corporate(4) 8 N.M.Total revenue$25,375 $21,427 18% Nine Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2015 2014 ChangePharmaceutical$66,440 $60,018 11%Medical8,540 8,168 5%Total segment revenue74,980 68,186 10%Corporate3 4 N.M.Total revenue$74,983 $68,190 10%Pharmaceutical SegmentCompared to the prior-year periods, sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers positively impacted revenue by $3.6 billion and $9.4 billion during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015, respectively. The growth was primarily driven by increased sales to existing customers, which were impacted by continued branded pharmaceutical price inflation and newly launched hepatitis C pharmaceutical products. The increase for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 was partially offset by the Walgreens contract expiration in the prior-year period ($3.3 billion). Medical SegmentRevenue growth for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the prior-year periods was due to acquisitions ($93 million and $285 million, respectively).Cost of Products SoldAs a result of the same factors affecting the change in revenue, cost of products sold increased $3.8 billion (19 percent) and $6.4 billion (10 percent) compared to the prior-year periods. See the gross margin discussion below for additional drivers impacting cost of products sold. Gross Margin Three Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2015 2014 ChangeGross margin$1,459 $1,297 12% Nine Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2015 2014 ChangeGross margin$4,254 $3,905 9%Consolidated gross margin increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the prior-year periods by $162 million and $349 million, respectively.Consolidated gross margin growth during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015 was positively impacted by sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers, and for the nine months ending March 31, 2015 was negatively impacted by the Walgreens contract expiration in the prior-year period. The net impact of these factors increased consolidated gross margin for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015 by $166 million and $357 million, respectively.Consolidated gross margin rate contracted during the three months ended March 31, 2015, which had an adverse impact on consolidated gross margin of $32 million. Apart from the Walgreens contract expiration in the prior-year period, consolidated gross margin rate also contracted during the nine months ended March 31, 2015, which had an adverse impact on consolidated gross margin of $87 million. Consolidated gross margin rate was adversely impacted by customer pricing changes, newly launched hepatitis C pharmaceutical products, and new customer mix. These were partially offset by strong performance from generic programs, which included benefits from Red Oak Sourcing.Consolidated gross margin during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015 was positively impacted by acquisitions ($28 million and $79 million, respectively).Distribution, Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses Three Months Ended March 31 (in millions)2015 2014 ChangeSG&A expenses$803 $736 9% Nine Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2015 2014 ChangeSG&A expenses$2,393 $2,233 7%The increase in SG&A expenses during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the prior-year period reflected acquisitions ($23 million and $75 million, 18Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)respectively), overall increase in new customer and product volume, and investments in information technology infrastructure.Segment Profit and Consolidated Operating Earnings Three Months Ended March 31 (in millions)2015 2014 ChangePharmaceutical$567 $452 25 %Medical102 111 (8)%Total segment profit669 563 19 %Corporate(78) (55) N.M.Total operating earnings$591 $508 16 % Nine Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2015 2014 ChangePharmaceutical$1,559 $1,368 14 %Medical330 348 (5)%Total segment profit1,889 1,716 10 %Corporate(286) (218) N.M.Total operating earnings$1,603 $1,498 7 %Pharmaceutical Segment ProfitThe increase in Pharmaceutical segment profit during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the prior-year periods was positively impacted by sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers and strong performance from generic programs, including benefits from Red Oak Sourcing, partially offset by the adverse impact of customer pricing changes. Pharmaceutical segment profit growth for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 was negatively impacted by the Walgreens contract expiration in the prior-year period.Medical Segment ProfitThe principal drivers for the decrease in Medical segment profit during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the prior-year period were decreases in contributions from national brand medical-surgical distribution sales and our Canadian business.Consolidated Operating EarningsIn addition to revenue, gross margin and SG&A expenses discussed above, operating earnings were impacted by the following:  Three Months Ended March 31(in millions)2015 2014Restructuring and employee severance$7 $5Amortization and other acquisition-related costs77 56Impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net(1) —Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net(18) (8) Nine Months Ended March 31(in millions)2015 2014Restructuring and employee severance$33 $25Amortization and other acquisition-related costs190 160Impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net(19) 10Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net54 (21)Restructuring and Employee SeveranceThe majority of restructuring costs incurred during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 related to restructuring activities within our Medical segment.Amortization and Other Acquisition-Related CostsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $48 million and $46 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $139 million and $138 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Amortization and other acquisition-related costs included transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Cordis of $21 million and $24 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015, respectively. We anticipate future integration costs to be commensurate with the size and complexity of this acquisition.Litigation (Recoveries)/Charges, NetDuring the nine months ended March 31, 2015, we incurred litigation charges of $34 million related to the DEA investigation and related matters and $27 million related to the FTC investigation, which were partially offset by litigation recoveries of $18 million, primarily consisting of settlements of class action antitrust claims in which we were a class member. These matters are discussed further in Note 8 of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements."Earnings Before Income Taxes and Discontinued OperationsIn addition to the items discussed above, earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following:19Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued) Three Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2015 2014 ChangeOther income, net$(2) $(33) N.M.Interest expense, net35 34 4%Loss on extinguishment of debt— — N.M.

Loss on Extinguishment of DebtIn December 2014 we redeemed certain debt resulting in a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $60 million ($37 million, net of tax). See Note 6 of "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information.Provision for Income TaxesFluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and U.S. state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items. During the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, the effective tax rate was 34.6 percent and 38.0 percent, respectively.During the nine months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, the effective tax rate was 36.3 percent and 35.5 percent, respectively. The March 31, 2014 effective tax rate was impacted by net favorable discrete items of $18 million. The discrete items included the favorable impact of the settlement of federal and state tax controversies ($67 million) and the unfavorable impact of remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits ($61 million).Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe currently believe that, based upon available capital resources (cash on hand and access to committed credit facilities) and projected operating cash flow, we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs; currently anticipated capital expenditures, business growth and expansion; contractual obligations; tax payments; and current and projected debt service requirements, dividends and share repurchases. If we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions, depending on the size and timing of such transactions, we may need to access capital in addition to cash on hand and our existing committed credit facilities. Cash and EquivalentsOur cash and equivalents balance was $3.2 billion at March 31, 2015 and $2.9 billion at June 30, 2014. At March 31, 2015, our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments. For the nine months ended March 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.7 billion was partially offset by share repurchases of $684 million and cash dividends of $346 million. In addition, we refinanced $1.2 billion of long-term debt at lower interest rates and longer maturities. Changes in working capital, which impact operating cash flow, can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments, inventory purchases and payments to vendors in the regular course of business, as well as fluctuating working capital needs driven by customer and product changes.The cash and equivalents balance at March 31, 2015 included $447 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation, permanently bringing the money into the United States could trigger U.S. federal, state and local income tax obligations.Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperOn November 3, 2014, we renewed our committed receivables sales facility program through Cardinal Health Funding, LLC until November 3, 2017 and increased the size of the facility from $700 million to $950 million with the inclusion of certain receivables from the Medical segment. Other sources of liquidity include a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion, backed by the revolving credit facility. At March 31, 2015, we had no outstanding balances or borrowings under these facilities, except for standby letters of credit of $41 million under the committed receivables sales facility program.Our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility program require us to maintain, as of any fiscal quarter end, a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 4-to-1 and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.25-to-1. As of March 31, 2015, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.Long-Term ObligationsIn November 2014, we sold $450 million aggregate principal amount of 2.4% Notes that mature on November 15, 2019, $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% Notes that mature on November 15, 2024, and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5% Notes that mature on November 15, 2044 in a registered offering.In December 2014, we used the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, to redeem all of the outstanding 4.0% Notes due 2015, 5.8% Notes due 2016, 5.85% Notes due 2017 and 6.0% Notes due 2017 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest, 20Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)plus the make-whole premium applicable to each series of notes. As a result of this redemption, during the three months ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $60 million ($37 million, net of tax).Funding of CordisIn connection with the binding offer to purchase the Cordis business, we entered into a $1.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan in March 2015. Borrowings under the senior unsecured bridge term loan bear interest based on the London Interbank Offered Rate. We expect to finance the acquisition with $1.0 billion in new long-term debt and terminate the bridge loan.Available-for-Sale SecuritiesAt March 31, 2015, we held $84 million of marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale.Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures were $139 million and $138 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.DividendsOn February 3, 2015 our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.3425 per share, or $1.37 on an annualized basis, which was paid on April 15, 2015 to shareholders of record on April 1, 2015.Share RepurchasesDuring the nine months ended March 31, 2015, we repurchased $684 million of our common shares. Our Board of Directors has approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, which expires on December 31, 2016. At March 31, 2015, we had $1.0 billion remaining under our repurchase authorization.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements at March 31, 2015.Contractual ObligationsExcept for the registered debt offering and debt redemption described above under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and in Note 6 of the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements," as of March 31, 2015 there have been no other material changes, outside of the ordinary course of business, in our outstanding contractual obligations disclosed in our 2014 Form 10-K.At March 31, 2015, our long-term debt and short-term borrowings and interest on long-term debt for the remainder of fiscal 2015 and fiscal periods thereafter are as follows: (in millions)2015 2016 to2017 2018 to2019 There-after TotalLong-term debt and short-term borrowings (1)$283 $312 $407 $3,001 $4,003Interest on long-term debt40 270 229 1,043 1,582Total long-term and short-term obligations$323 $582 $636 $4,044 $5,585 (1)Represents maturities of our long-term debt obligations and other short-term borrowings.

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates since the end of fiscal 2014 through March 31, 2015.21Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThere have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative market risks since the end of fiscal 2014 through March 31, 2015 from those reported in our 2014 Form 10-K.Item 4: Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) as of March 31, 2015. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of March 31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.22Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesPart II. Other InformationItem 1: Legal ProceedingsIn addition to the proceedings described below, the legal proceedings described in Note 8 of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" are incorporated in this "Item 1: Legal Proceedings" by reference. On January 23, 2015, Erste-Sparinvest Kapitalanlagegesellschaft m.b.H., a purported shareholder, filed a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the current and certain former members of our Board of Directors alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to implement and maintain a system to prevent diversion of controlled substances in connection with, among other things, the DEA’s past suspensions of our distribution centers’ registrations. The derivative complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified money damages against the defendants and an award of attorney's fees. This same plaintiff had made demand on our Board of Directors in May 2014 to take action against current and certain former directors based on allegations similar to those made in the derivative complaint. A special committee of independent directors investigated the allegations made in the demand, and after receiving and evaluating the special committee's findings and recommendations with respect to the demand, our Board of Directors determined in November 2014 that pursuing the claims set forth in the demand was not in the best interest of the company. In the derivative complaint, the plaintiff also alleges that the Board of Directors wrongfully rejected the demand. In April 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the derivative complaint.Item 1A: Risk FactorsYou should carefully consider the information in this Form 10-Q and the risk factors discussed in "Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors"  and other risks discussed in our 2014 Form 10-K and our filings with the SEC since June 30, 2014. These risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. Our business also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations.
