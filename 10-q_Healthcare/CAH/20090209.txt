Item 1A: Risk Factors”) and are incorporated in this Form 10-Q by reference. Except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  Overview  Cardinal Health is a leading provider of products and services that help improve the safety and productivity of healthcare. The Company is one of the largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. The Company also manufactures medication infusion and dispensing products, respiratory equipment and surgical instruments and provides leading technologies and services that help hospitals prevent medication errors, reduce hospital-acquired infections and manage medications and supplies more efficiently. Customers include hospitals and clinics, some of the largest drug store chains in the United States, and many other healthcare providers and retail outlets. The Company believes that its depth and breadth of products is unique in the industry and gives it a competitive advantage.  Continued demand for the Company’s products and services during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 led to revenue of $25.1 billion, up 8%, and $49.4 billion, up 9%, respectively, from the same periods in the prior year. Operating earnings were approximately $538 million and $964 million, respectively, an increase of 4% during the three months ended December 31, 2008 and a decrease of 4% during the six months ended December 31, 2008 from the same periods in the prior year. Operating earnings were favorably impacted by increased gross margin ($62 million and $84 million, respectively) offset by increases in SG&A expenses ($23 million and $75 million, respectively). Net earnings for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 were $317 million and $566 million, respectively, and net diluted earnings per Common Share were $0.88 and $1.57, respectively. See Note 10 in “Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for a reconciliation of Basic EPS to Diluted EPS.  Cash used in operating activities totaled $81 million during the six months ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to changes in the Company’s working capital. Cash used in operating activities included the favorable impact of the $450 million outstanding under the committed receivables sales facility program at December 31, 2008. This impact will reverse once repayment is made. Cash used in investing activities was $176 million primarily due to capital spending ($182 million). Cash used in financing activities was $261 million primarily due to the Company’s repayment of long-term obligations ($307 million). Also during the six months ended December 31, 2008, the Company paid $100 million in dividends or $0.14 per share.  Planned Spin-Off of Clinical and Medical Products Businesses  On September 29, 2008, the Company announced that it plans to spin off most of its clinical and medical products businesses from its remaining businesses through a pro rata distribution to the Company’s shareholders (the “Planned Spin-Off”). The Company will retain certain surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management businesses that are currently part of the Clinical and Medical Products segment. Completion of the Planned Spin-Off is subject to final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, confirmation of the tax-free nature of the Planned Spin-Off and the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement that will be filed with the SEC. While it is currently anticipated that the Planned Spin-Off will be completed by the middle of calendar 2009, there can be no assurance as to the timing or terms of the Planned Spin-Off should it be completed. See “Part II, Item 1A—Risk Factors” for certain risk factors relating to the Planned Spin-Off.  In connection with the Planned Spin-Off, the Company has announced that R. Kerry Clark will continue to lead the Company through the Planned Spin-Off and then retire as the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Following Mr. Clark’s retirement, George S. Barrett, Vice Chairman of Cardinal Health and Chief Executive Officer of Healthcare Supply Chain Services, is expected to become the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Jeffrey W. Henderson will remain the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. David L. Schlotterbeck, Vice Chairman of Cardinal Health and Chief Executive Officer of Clinical and Medical Products, is expected to become Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the spin-off company.    24    Table of Contents The Company currently anticipates the total expenditures associated with the Planned Spin-Off for both businesses will be in the range of $200 million to $230 million in the period up to and including the day of the spin-off. These expenditures will primarily consist of employee-related costs, including severance, stand-up costs for various operations and systems and one-time transaction related costs.  Consolidated Results of Operations  The following summarizes the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007:                                  Three Months EndedDecember 31,     Six Months EndedDecember 31,     (in millions, except per Common Share amounts)   Change (1)     2008     2007     Change (1)     2008     2007     Revenue   8  %   $ 25,099.5     $ 23,282.7     9  %   $ 49,446.7     $ 45,256.1     Cost of products sold   8  %     23,683.1       21,928.1     10  %     46,665.8       42,559.3                                               Gross margin   5  %   $ 1,416.4     $ 1,354.6     3  %   $ 2,780.9     $ 2,696.8     Selling, general and administrative expenses   3  %     851.9       828.9     5  %     1,734.1       1,659.0     Impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net   N.M.       6.9       (23.0 )   N.M.       10.5       (23.2 )   Special items   N.M.       19.7       29.5     N.M.       72.1       52.0                                               Operating earnings   4  %   $ 537.9     $ 519.2     (4 )%   $ 964.2     $ 1,009.0     Interest expense and other   25  %     62.4       50.0     34  %     124.8       92.9                                               Earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations   1  %   $ 475.5     $ 469.2     (8 )%   $ 839.4     $ 916.1     Provision for income taxes   9  %     156.6       144.1     (6 )%     270.7       287.8                                               Earnings from continuing operations   (2 )%   $ 318.9     $ 325.1     (9 )%   $ 568.7     $ 628.3     Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax   N.M.

Revenue  Revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 increased $1.8 billion or 8% and $4.2 billion or 9%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were due to pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased volume from existing customers (the combined impact of pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased volume was $1.9 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively), the addition of new customers ($240 million and $446 million, respectively) and the impact of acquisitions ($253 million and $420 million, respectively). The Company uses the internal metric “pharmaceutical price appreciation index” to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical and consumer product price appreciation on revenue from the pharmaceutical supply chain business. This metric is calculated using the change in the manufacturer’s published price at the beginning of the period as compared to the end of the period weighted by the units sold by the pharmaceutical supply chain business during the period. The pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 8.4% for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2008. Revenue was negatively impacted during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 by the loss of customers ($486 million and $927 million, respectively). Refer to “Segment Results of Operations” below for further discussion of the specific factors affecting revenue in each of the Company’s reportable segments.  Cost of Products Sold  Cost of products sold for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 increased $1.8 billion or 8% and $4.1 billion or 10%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in cost of products sold was mainly due to the respective 8% and 9% increases in revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same periods in the prior year. See the “Gross Margin” discussion below for further discussion of additional factors impacting cost of products sold.    25    Table of Contents Gross Margin  Gross margin for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 increased $62 million or 5% and $84 million or 3%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to the respective 8% and 9% growth in revenue, which included the impact of acquisitions ($50 million and $87 million, respectively). Gross margin was negatively impacted by an increase in customer discounts within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment ($80 million and $180 million, respectively). This increase was primarily due to increased sales volumes and the repricing of certain customer contracts over the last 12 months. Refer to the “Segment Results of Operations” below for further discussion of the specific factors affecting gross margin in each of the Company’s reportable segments.  Due to the competitive markets in which the Company’s businesses operate, the Company expects competitive pricing pressures to continue; however, the Company expects the margin impact of these pricing pressures over the long-term will be mitigated through effective product sourcing, realization of synergies through integration of acquired businesses and continued focus on cost controls.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  SG&A expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 increased $23 million or 3% and $75 million or 5%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily in support of revenue growth, which included the impact of acquisitions, net of divestitures ($20 million and $36 million, respectively). Refer to “Segment Results of Operations” below for further discussion of the specific factors affecting SG&A expenses in each of the Company’s reportable segments.  The Company expects fiscal 2009 SG&A expenses to increase moderately compared to the prior fiscal year in support of sales growth and new product and service offerings and as a result of the impact of acquisitions and increased investment in research and development and information technology projects; however, the Company has generated expense efficiencies through the integration of acquired companies and other cost controls. The Company does not expect share-based compensation and incentive compensation expenses for fiscal 2009 to be materially different from the prior fiscal year.  Impairments, (Gain)/Loss on Sale of Assets and Other, Net  The Company recognized impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net of $7 million and $11 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 compared to $(23) million for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2007. See Note 2 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for detail of activity during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.  Special Items  The following is a summary of the Company’s special items for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007:                           Three Months EndedDecember 31,     Six Months EndedDecember 31,     (in millions)   2008     2007     2008   2007     Restructuring charges   $ 14.2     $ 31.5     $ 63.9   $ 46.2     Acquisition integration charges     5.8       10.0       8.2     15.5     Litigation and other     (0.3 )     (12.0 )     —      (9.7 )                                   Total special items   $ 19.7     $ 29.5     $ 72.1   $ 52.0    During the three months ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized restructuring charges of $14 million primarily related to the Planned Spin-Off. During the six months ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized restructuring charges of $64 million primarily related to the restructuring of its segment operating structure and the Planned Spin-Off. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized income of $23 million related to the settlement of the Derivatives Actions discussed in Note 12 in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2008 Form 10-K. The income was offset by charges of $10 million and $11 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 related to the settlement of certain litigation in the Company’s Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment. See Note 2 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional detail of the Company’s special items during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.  Operating Earnings  Operating earnings increased $19 million or 4% during the three months ended December 31, 2008 and decreased $45 million or 4% during the six months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase during the three months ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to a higher gross margin ($62 million) and decreased restructuring charges ($17 million), partially offset by increased impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net ($30 million) and SG&A expenses ($23 million). The decrease during the six months ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to increased SG&A expenses ($75 million) and increased impairment, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net ($34 million), partially offset by higher gross margin ($84 million).    26    Table of Contents Interest Expense and Other  Interest expense and other increased $12 million or 25% and $32 million or 34%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and other items ($21 million and $35 million, respectively) partially offset by decreased interest expense ($22 million and $29 million, respectively) due to the favorable impact of interest rate swaps on fixed rate debt.  The Company expects higher interest expense and other for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year as the favorable impact of foreign exchange that was experienced in fiscal 2008 is not expected to continue in fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2009 foreign exchange impact has been unfavorable year to date. Partially offsetting the foreign exchange impact, the Company expects decreased interest expense as a result of its outstanding interest rate swaps of fixed rate debt.  Provision for Income Taxes  The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years ending June 30, 2001 through the current fiscal year.  The IRS currently has ongoing audits of fiscal years 2001 through 2005. During the three months ended March 31, 2008, the Company received NPAs from the IRS related to fiscal years 2001 through 2005 challenging deductions arising from the sale of trade receivables to a special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity as described in more detail in Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2008 Form 10-K. The amount of additional tax, excluding penalties and interest which may be significant, proposed by the IRS in these notices was $179 million. The Company disagrees with the proposed adjustments and intends to vigorously contest them. The Company anticipates that this transaction could be the subject of proposed adjustments by the IRS in tax audits of fiscal years 2006 to present. The Company, in normal course, terminated the transaction during the second quarter of fiscal 2009.  During the six months ended December 31, 2008, the Company received an IRS Revenue Agent Report for tax years 2003 through 2005 which included the NPAs discussed above and new NPAs related to transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among subsidiaries of an acquired entity prior to its acquisition by the Company. The amount of additional tax proposed by the IRS in these notices total $598 million, excluding penalties and interest which may be significant. The Company disagrees with these proposed adjustments and intends to vigorously contest them.  If the two preceding matters are not resolved in the Company’s favor, they may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. See Note 6 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for more information on these matters.  The Company’s effective tax rate was 33.0% and 32.3%, respectively, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 30.7% and 31.4%, respectively, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007. Generally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are primarily due to changes within international and state effective tax rates resulting from the Company’s business mix and changes in the tax impact of special items and other discrete items, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.  During the three and six months ended December 31, 2008, the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by discrete tax adjustments of $9 million and $16 million, respectively. During the six months ended December 31, 2008 there was a favorable tax adjustment of $23 million as the result of the release of a valuation allowance that had previously been established for capital losses for which the Company’s ability to utilize were uncertain. Also, there was an unfavorable tax adjustment of $9 million for accrued interest expense related to an unrecognized tax benefit recorded through goodwill. The remaining favorable adjustment of $2 million is due to miscellaneous discrete tax items.  See Note 6 in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on the Company’s provision for income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits.  Loss from Discontinued Operations  See Note 4 in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for information on the Company’s discontinued operations.    27    Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations  Reportable Segments  During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company reorganized its businesses into three reportable segments — the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment, the Clinical and Medical Products segment and the All Other segment — in order to reduce costs and align resources with the needs of each segment. The Company evaluates the performance of the individual segments based upon, among other things, segment profit. Segment profit is segment revenue less segment cost of products sold, less segment SG&A expenses. Segment SG&A expense includes equity compensation expense as well as allocated corporate expenses for shared functions, including corporate management, corporate finance, financial shared services, human resources, information technology, legal and legislative affairs and an integrated hospital sales organization. Information about interest income and expense and income taxes is not provided at the segment level. In addition, special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net are not allocated to the segments. See Note 12 in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on the Company’s reportable segments.  The following table summarizes segment revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007:                                  Three Months EndedDecember 31,     Six Months EndedDecember 31,     (in millions, except growth rates)   Change (1)     2008     2007     Change (1)     2008     2007     Healthcare Supply Chain Services   8 %   $ 24,096.0     $ 22,346.4     9 %   $ 47,514.4     $ 43,439.3     Clinical and Medical Products   7 %     1,214.5       1,133.0     9 %     2,369.4       2,165.5     All Other   (12 )%     265.1       300.9     (10 )%     538.1       594.6                                               Total segment revenue   8 %     25,575.6       23,780.3     9 %     50,421.9       46,199.4     Corporate (2)   N.M.

(2) Corporate revenue primarily consists of the elimination of inter-segment revenue.  The following table summarizes segment profit for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007:                                 Three Months EndedDecember 31,   Six Months EndedDecember 31,     (in millions, except growth rates)   Change (1)     2008     2007   Change (1)     2008     2007     Healthcare Supply Chain Services (2)   6 %   $ 333.0     $ 314.6   (6 )%   $ 625.3     $ 661.9     Clinical and Medical Products (2)   16  %     198.3       170.6   16  %     365.0       315.8     All Other (2)   25  %     30.8       24.6   16  %     54.7       47.0                                             Total segment profit   10 %     562.1       509.8   2  %     1,045.0       1,024.7     Corporate (2) (3)   N.M.

(2) Investment spending previously held at Corporate has been allocated to the segments under the new segment structure. Prior period information has been reclassified to conform to this new presentation. See Note 17 in the 2008 Form 10-K for an explanation of investment spending.    (3) For the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, Corporate includes special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net, which are not allocated to the segments, described below:        •    Special items — Corporate includes special items of $20 million and $72 million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008, respectively, and $30 million and $52 million, respectively, for the comparable prior year periods (see Note 2 of “Notes of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of special items).        •    Impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net — Asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as special items or discontinued operations are retained at Corporate. Impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net were $7 million and $11 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008, respectively, and $(23) million during both the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 (see Note 2 in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion).    28    Table of Contents Healthcare Supply Chain Services Performance  Healthcare Supply Chain Services revenue growth of $1.7 billion or 8% and $4.1 billion or 9%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to additional volume from existing customers and pharmaceutical price appreciation (the combined impact of pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased volume from existing customers was $1.9 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively). The pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 8.4% for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2008. Revenue was also positively impacted by the addition of new customers ($240 million and $446 million, respectively). Revenue growth was negatively impacted by the loss of customers ($486 million and $926 million, respectively). The DEA license suspensions and the Company’s controlled substance anti-diversion efforts resulted in non-bulk customer losses and adversely affected the Company’s ability to acquire new non-bulk customers. In October 2008, without admitting any wrongdoing, the Company entered into settlement agreements with the DEA and seven U.S. Attorneys’ offices resulting in reinstatement of the suspended licenses. The Company resumed controlled substance shipments from the distribution centers that were impacted by the license suspensions during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 7 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for more information regarding the DEA matter.  Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment profit increased $18 million or 6% during the three months ended December 31, 2008 and decreased $37 million or 6% during the six months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Segment profit was positively impacted by an increase in gross margin of $35 million and $7 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008, respectively, and was negatively impacted by an increase in SG&A of $17 million and $44 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008, respectively. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation (combined impact of $62 million and $78 million, respectively), increased sales volume resulting in increased manufacturer cash discounts ($31 million and $76 million, respectively) and increased margin from generic pharmaceuticals ($31 million and $37 million, respectively) primarily due to the impact of generic launches in the current periods. Gross margin was negatively impacted by increased customer discounts ($80 million and $180 million, respectively) as a result of increased sales volume and the repricing of certain customer contracts within the last 12 months. The Company expects a certain level of continued pricing pressure due to the competitive market in which it operates. Lost customer revenue from the DEA license suspensions and the Company’s controlled substance anti-diversion efforts also adversely affected gross margin during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008. SG&A expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 increased primarily as a result of increased sales volume ($10 million and $20 million, respectively).  The Company’s results could be adversely affected if sales of pharmaceutical products decline, competitive pricing pressure intensifies, the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches decreases, generic price deflation increases, or pharmaceutical price appreciation on branded products decreases. Alternatively, the Company’s results could benefit if sales of pharmaceutical products increase, the Company is able to increase its gross margin, the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches increases, generic price deflation decreases, or pharmaceutical price appreciation on branded products increases.  Bulk and Non-Bulk Customers. The Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment differentiates between bulk and non-bulk customers with respect to the distribution of pharmaceutical, radiopharmaceutical and over-the-counter healthcare products because bulk customers generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than that generated by non-bulk customers. Hereinafter all references to bulk and non-bulk customers are confined to the product categories above. Bulk customers consist of customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses. All other customers are classified as non-bulk customers (for example, retail stores, pharmacies, hospitals and alternate care sites). Bulk customers include the warehouse operations of retail chains whose retail stores are classified as non-bulk customers. A single retail chain pharmacy customer may be both a bulk customer with respect to its warehouse operations and a non-bulk customer with respect to its retail stores. Bulk customers have the ability to process large quantities of products in central locations and self-distribute these products to their individual retail stores or customers. Substantially all deliveries to bulk customers consist of product shipped in the same form as the product is received from the manufacturer, but a small portion of deliveries to bulk customers are broken down into smaller units prior to shipping. Non-bulk customers, on the other hand, require more complex servicing by the Company. These services, all of which are performed by the Company, include receiving inventory in large or full case quantities and breaking it down into smaller quantities, warehousing the product for a longer period of time, picking individual products specific to a customer’s order and delivering that smaller order to a customer location.    29    Table of Contents The Company tracks revenue by bulk and non-bulk customers in its financial systems. An internal analysis has been prepared to estimate segment profit from bulk and non-bulk customers by allocating segment expenses (total of segment cost of products sold and segment SG&A expenses) separately for bulk and non-bulk customers. The following table shows the allocation of segment expenses, segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007:                            Three Months EndedDecember 31,     Six Months EndedDecember 31,     (in millions, except percentage of revenue)   2008     2007     2008     2007     Non-bulk customers:                       Revenue from non-bulk customers   $ 10,888     $ 10,666     $ 21,496     $ 20,901     Segment expenses allocated to non-bulk customers (1)   $ 10,666     $ 10,458     $ 21,085     $ 20,456     Segment profit from non-bulk customers (1)   $ 222     $ 208     $ 411     $ 445     Segment profit from non-bulk customers as a percentage of revenue from non-bulk customers (1)     2.0 %     1.9 %     1.9 %     2.1 %   Bulk customers:                       Revenue from bulk customers   $ 11,124     $ 9,691     $ 21,853     $ 18,631     Segment expenses allocated to bulk customers (1)   $ 11,086     $ 9,657     $ 21,783     $ 18,541     Segment profit from bulk customers (1)   $ 38     $ 34     $ 70     $ 90     Segment profit from bulk customers as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers (1)     0.3 %     0.4 %     0.3 %     0.5 %      (1) Amounts shown are estimates based upon the internal analysis described above. The preparation of this internal analysis required the use of complex and subjective estimates and allocations based upon assumptions, past experience and judgment that the Company believes are reasonable. The core pharmaceutical distribution operation (“Distribution”) services both bulk and non-bulk customers. Therefore, expenses associated with this operation were allocated between bulk and non-bulk customers as described below. The brokerage operation (“Brokerage”) only services bulk customers, therefore, expenses associated with Brokerage are allocated to bulk customers. The remaining operations (i.e., excluding Distribution) service non-bulk customers, therefore, expenses associated with these operations were allocated to non-bulk customers.  The following describes the allocation of the major components of cost of products sold for Distribution between bulk and non-bulk customers:        •    Cost of products sold for pharmaceutical products is determined by specifically tracking the manufacturer’s designated price of products, at the time the products are sold, by bulk and non-bulk customers. The manufacturer’s designated price is then reduced by other components impacting cost of products sold, including distribution service agreement fees, pharmaceutical price appreciation, manufacturer cash discounts and manufacturer rebates and incentives. In addition, other inventory charges and credits are added or subtracted, as appropriate, to arrive at cost of products sold. The Company used the following methods that it believes provide a reasonable correlation to allocate the remaining components of cost of products sold between bulk and non-bulk customers:        •    Distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation are tracked by manufacturer. Therefore, the Company allocated the distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation associated with each manufacturer among their products in proportion to sales of each product between bulk and non-bulk customers.        •    Manufacturer cash discounts are recognized as a reduction to cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold and were allocated in proportion to the manufacturer’s published price of the product sold to bulk and non-bulk customers.        •    Manufacturers’ rebates and incentives are based on the individual agreements entered into with manufacturers related to specific products. Rebates and incentives were grouped by contract terms and then allocated in proportion to sales to bulk and non-bulk customers.        •    Other inventory charges and credits include charges for outdated and returned inventory items and fluctuation in inventory reserves. The Company estimated the portion of these inventory charges and credits attributable to each product and then allocated them to bulk and non-bulk customers in proportion to the sales of these products.  The Company used methods that it believes provide a reasonable correlation to allocate the SG&A expenses for Distribution between bulk and non-bulk customers as follows:        •    Warehouse expense includes labor-related expenses associated with receiving, shipping and handling the inventory as well as warehouse storage costs including insurance, taxes, supplies and other facility costs. Warehouse expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoice line items filled for each bulk or non-bulk customer because the Company believes that there is a correlation between the number of different products ordered as reflected in invoice     30    Table of Contents       lines and the level of effort associated with receiving, shipping and handling that order (bulk customers typically order substantially larger quantities of products and therefore generate substantially fewer invoice lines which results in substantially less warehouse expense being allocated to bulk customers);        •    Delivery expense includes transportation costs associated with physically moving the product from the warehouse to the customer’s designated location. Delivery expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoices generated for each bulk or non-bulk customer on the assumption that each invoice generates a delivery;        •    Sales expense includes personnel-related costs associated with sales and customer service activities (such activities are the same for both bulk and non-bulk customers). Sales expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoices generated for each bulk or non-bulk customer because customer invoices are a reasonable estimate of the amount of customer service calls and sales effort; and        •    General and administrative expenses were allocated in proportion to the units of products sold to bulk or non-bulk customers. These expenses were allocated on the assumption that general and administrative expenses increase or decrease in direct relation to the volume of sales.  The internal analysis indicated segment expenses as a percentage of revenue were higher for bulk customers than for non-bulk customers because of higher segment cost of products sold partially offset by lower segment SG&A expenses. Bulk customers receive lower pricing on sales of the same products than non-bulk customers due to volume pricing in a competitive market and the lower costs related to the services provided by the Company. In addition, sales to bulk customers in aggregate generate higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than sales to non-bulk customers because bulk customers’ orders consist almost entirely of higher cost branded products. The higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is also driven by lower manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and branded pharmaceutical price appreciation and lower manufacturer cash discounts. Manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and manufacturer cash discounts are recognized as a reduction to segment cost of products sold and are lower as a percentage of revenue due to the mix of products sold. Pharmaceutical price appreciation increases customer pricing which, in turn, results in higher segment gross margin for sales of inventory that was on-hand at the time of the manufacturer’s price increase. Since products sold to bulk customers are generally held in inventory for a shorter time than products sold to non-bulk customers, there is less opportunity to realize the benefit of pharmaceutical price appreciation. Consequently, segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is higher than for non-bulk customers and segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue is substantially lower for bulk customers than for non-bulk customers. Deliveries to bulk customers require substantially less services by the Company than deliveries to non-bulk customers. As such, segment SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers are substantially lower than from non-bulk customers. These factors result in segment profit as a percentage of revenue being significantly lower for bulk customers than for non-bulk customers.  The Company defines bulk and non-bulk customers based on the way in which the Company operates its business and the services it performs for its customers. The Company is not aware of an industry standard regarding the definition of bulk customers and based solely on a review of the Annual Reports on Form 10-K of other national pharmaceutical wholesalers, the Company notes that other companies in comparable businesses may, or may not, use a different definition of bulk customers.  During the three and six months ended December 31, 2008, revenue from non-bulk customers increased $223 million and $595 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to increased volume from existing customers and acquisitions, partially offset by the adverse impact from the DEA license suspensions and the Company’s controlled substance anti-diversion efforts. Segment profit from non-bulk customers increased $14 million during the three months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increased margin from generic pharmaceuticals. Segment profit from non-bulk customers decreased $34 million during the six months ended December 31, 2008, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year due primarily to an increase in customer discounts partially offset by an increase in margin from generic pharmaceuticals. In addition, segment profit from non-bulk customers was negatively impacted by certain business from one of the Company’s largest customers moving from non-bulk to bulk late in fiscal 2008.  During the three and six months ended December 31, 2008, revenue from bulk customers increased $1.4 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to increased volume from existing customers and new customers. Segment profit from bulk customers increased $4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased manufacturer cash discounts, partially offset by increased customer discounts as a result of increased sales volume and the repricing of certain customer contracts within the last 12 months. Segment profit from bulk customers decreased $20 million during the six months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increased customer discounts partially offset by increased distribution service agreement fees, pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased manufacturer cash discounts. Segment profit from bulk customers was positively impacted by certain business from one of the Company’s largest customers moving from non-bulk to bulk late in fiscal 2008.    31    Table of Contents Clinical and Medical Products Performance  Clinical and Medical Products segment revenue grew $82 million or 7% and $204 million or 9%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the prior year periods. Revenue growth was favorably impacted by acquisitions ($53 million and $99 million, respectively), increased volume from existing customers ($28 million and $53 million, respectively) and new products ($15 million and $32 million, respectively). Revenue was negatively impacted by foreign exchange ($34 million and $24 million, respectively).  Clinical and Medical Products segment profit increased $28 million or 16% and $50 million or 16%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the prior year periods. Gross margin increased segment profit by $33 million and $89 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of revenue growth and acquisitions ($35 million and $67 million, respectively), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange ($28 million and $25 million, respectively) and an increase in raw material costs ($18 million and $36 million, respectively). In addition, the comparison of gross margin for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 was favorably impacted by $10 million as a result of charges for product recalls and reserves in the prior year periods. Increases in SG&A expenses decreased segment profit by $5 million and $39 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to the impact of acquisitions ($15 million and $30 million, respectively).  The Company expects that this segment will continue to incur certain increased raw material costs until later in fiscal 2009 due to the higher price of resins and petroleum-based products that the segment uses to produce its products. Resin prices generally tend to lag the movement in oil prices by a few months. In addition, raw material contract terms are typically structured to adjust prices on a periodic basis. This has the effect of delaying the financial statement impact of decreasing oil prices. The Company also has observed that certain hospitals delaying capital equipment purchase decisions, which it expects to have an adverse impact on the Clinical and Medical Products segment results for the second half of fiscal 2009.  All Other Performance  All Other segment revenue declined $36 million or 12% and $57 million or 10%, respectively during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the prior year periods. The revenue decline was driven by lost customers ($20 million and $36 million, respectively) and the divestiture of the Medsystems and Tecomet businesses ($20 million and $24 million, respectively).  All Other segment profit increased $6 million or 25% and $8 million or 16%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the prior year periods. A decline in gross margin decreased segment profit by $3 million and $6 million and a decline in SG&A expenses increased segment profit by $9 million and $14 million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2008, respectively.  In addition, positively impacting revenue and segment profit for the All Other segment for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 was $14 million in Medicine Shoppe and Medicap franchise termination fees.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Sources and Uses of Cash  The following table summarizes the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007:                    Six Months EndedDecember 31,     (in millions)   2008     2007     Net cash provided by/(used in)             Operating activities   $ (81.3 )   $ 382.6     Investing activities   $ (176.1 )   $ (72.0 )   Financing activities   $ (261.3 )   $ (435.0 )  Operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities during the six months ended December 31, 2008 totaled $81 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended December 31, 2007 of $383 million. Net cash used in operating activities included the favorable impact of the $450 million outstanding under the committed receivables sales facility program at December 31, 2008. The decrease in net cash from operating activities was primarily a result of an increase in working capital compared to the prior year period. The most significant changes in working capital were increased inventories ($1.7 billion) and increased trade receivables ($154 million), partially offset by increased accounts payable ($1.3 billion). These increases were due primarily to Healthcare Supply Chain Services revenue growth as well as the timing of inventory purchases, receipts and payments. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors during the regular course of business and particularly during the second quarter of the Company’s fiscal year. In addition, the current period was negatively impacted by increased inventory levels related to a large customer.    32    Table of Contents Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities of $176 million during the six months ended December 31, 2008 primarily reflected capital spending ($182 million).  Net cash used in investing activities of $72 million during the six months ended December 31, 2007 reflected capital spending ($172 million) partially offset by the net proceeds from the sale of short-term investments classified as available for sale ($132 million). In addition, the Company utilized cash to complete the Viasys acquisition within the Clinical and Medical Products segment slightly offset by cash received for the divestiture of an investment within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment (combined impact $39 million).  Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities of $261 million during the six months ended December 31, 2008 reflected the Company’s repayment of long-term obligations ($307 million) and dividend payments to shareholders ($100 million). Cash provided by financing activities included the net change in commercial paper and short-term borrowings ($101 million). See “Capital Resources” below for further discussion of the Company’s financing activities.  Net cash used in financing activities of $435 million during the six months ended December 31, 2007 reflected the Company’s repurchase of its Common Shares ($1.0 billion) and dividend payments to shareholders ($88 million). Cash provided by financing activities included the net change in commercial paper and short-term borrowings ($519 million) and proceeds received from shares issued under various employee stock plans ($164 million).  Share Repurchase Program  During the six months ended December 31, 2008, the Company did not purchase any of its Common Shares under its existing $2.0 billion share repurchase program announced on August 8, 2007. This repurchase authorization will expire on August 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, approximately $1.3 billion remained from the $2.0 billion repurchase authorization. The Company expects share repurchases for fiscal 2009 to approximately offset dilution from issuances of shares under the Company’s stock incentive plans.  See the table under “Part II, Item 2” for more information regarding these repurchases.  Capital Resources  The Company’s cash and equivalents balance was $773 million at December 31, 2008 compared to $1.3 billion at June 30, 2008. The cash balance at December 31, 2008 was affected by the July 2008 repayment of $150 million of 6.25% notes due 2008, repayment of $149 million for the preferred debt securities (see discussion below for further information) in October 2008 and by net cash used in operating activities of $81 million, which was driven by an increase in working capital as described above.  The Company’s cash and equivalents balance as of December 31, 2008 included $297 million of cash held by its subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject it to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. The U.S. parent of the Company may temporarily access cash held by foreign subsidiaries without subjecting it to U.S. federal income tax through intercompany loans. A notice issued by the IRS in October 2008 announced that the Treasury Department will issue regulations that will, for a temporary period, extend the permitted duration of such intercompany loans that qualify for suspended deemed dividend treatment under Section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Such intercompany loans from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent must be repaid within 60 days from commencement and cannot exceed 180 cumulative days during the year. At December 31, 2008 and June 30, 2008, the intercompany loan balance of the Company totaled $330 million and $0 million, respectively (cash held by foreign subsidiaries prior to the loan at December 31, 2008 was $627 million). The position set forth in the notice will apply for the Company until June 30, 2010.  In addition to cash, the Company’s sources of liquidity include a $1.5 billion commercial paper program backed by a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a committed receivables sales facility program with the capacity to sell $850 million in receivables. The Company had $100 million outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program at December 31, 2008. Due to general market conditions, market demand for the Company’s A-2, P-2 and F2-rated commercial paper from September through December 2008 was limited; however, the market has improved since the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009, and the Company issued up to $400 million of commercial paper during January 2009. The Company had $450 million outstanding under the committed receivables sales facility program at December 31, 2008. The committed receivables sales facility program was amended in mid-November 2008 to extend it for an additional 364 days.  During fiscal 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to periodically sell trade receivables to a special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity (the “Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity”), which was exclusively engaged in purchasing trade receivables from, and making loans to, the Company. The Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity, which was consolidated by the Company as it was the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity, issued preferred variable debt securities to parties not affiliated with the Company. On October 3, 2008, the Company repaid the remaining balance of $149 million for the preferred debt securities and the agreement was terminated.    33    Table of Contents The Company’s capital resources are more fully described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 5, 10 and 19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2008 Form 10-K.  The Company currently believes that, based upon existing cash, operating cash flows, available capital resources (as discussed above) and other available market transactions, it has adequate capital resources at its disposal to fund currently anticipated capital expenditures, business growth and expansion, working capital needs, contractual obligations and current and projected debt service requirements, including those related to business combinations.  From time to time, the Company considers and engages in acquisition transactions in order to expand its role as a leading provider of products and services that improve the safety and productivity of healthcare. The Company evaluates possible candidates for acquisition and considers opportunities to expand its role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry through all its reportable segments. If additional transactions are entered into or consummated, the Company may need to enter into funding arrangements for such acquisitions.  Debt Ratings/Covenants  The Company’s senior debt credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) are BBB+, Baa2 and BBB+, respectively, and the commercial paper ratings are A-2, P-2 and F2, respectively. The S&P ratings outlook is “stable.” With the announcement of the Planned Spin-Off, Moody’s changed its ratings outlook from “stable” to “review for possible downgrade” and Fitch changed its ratings outlook from “stable” to “ratings watch negative.” It is possible that the Planned Spin-Off could be a factor causing or contributing to a determination by one or more of the rating agencies to lower the credit rating of the Company. Although it will not trigger an acceleration of any of the Company’s indebtedness, a ratings downgrade by any of the ratings agencies may eliminate or significantly diminish the Company’s ability to gain access to the commercial paper market, resulting in the need for the Company to utilize alternative sources of credit at rates that may be higher than would otherwise be available to the Company.  The Company’s various borrowing facilities and long-term debt are free of any financial covenants other than minimum net worth which cannot fall below $5.0 billion at any time. As of December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with this covenant. If the Planned Spin-Off occurs, the net worth of the Company is expected to fall below $5.0 billion; therefore, the terms of this covenant will be modified prior to the Planned Spin-Off.  Contractual Obligations  There have been no material changes, outside of the ordinary course of business, in the Company’s outstanding contractual obligations from those disclosed within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2008 Form 10-K.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capital Resources” and Note 14 in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” above and Note 19 in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2008 Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements.  Recent Financial Accounting Standards  See Note 1 in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards.      Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  The Company believes that there has been no material change in the quantitative and qualitative market risks from those discussed in the 2008 Form 10-K. See “Part II, Item 1A—Risk Factors” for risk factors relating to disruptions in the financial markets.      Item 4: Controls and Procedures  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company carried out an evaluation, as required by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2008. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and     34    Table of Contents  procedures were effective as of December 31, 2008 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and to provide that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During fiscal 2008, the Company began processing selected financial transactions for its corporate functions and certain businesses within its Clinical and Medical Products and All Other segments on a new accounting software system. During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, the Company transitioned selected financial processes for certain businesses within its Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment, including its pharmaceutical supply chain, nuclear pharmacy and Canadian distribution businesses, to the new accounting software system. During the quarter ended December 31, 2008, the Company transitioned selected financial processes for the medical products distribution and manufacturing businesses within its Healthcare Supply Chain Services and Clinical and Medical Products segments to the new accounting software system. Implementation of the new system is now substantially complete. This change of systems was designed to streamline and integrate the Company’s financial close and reporting processes by reducing the number of platforms used to record and report financial information, improving efficiency by reducing the amount of manual activity, and improving the control environment by reducing variability in the financial policies, processes and systems. The Company has made changes to its internal control over financial reporting in connection with this transition to the new accounting software system. During fiscal 2008, the Company established additional temporary compensating controls to support the Company’s internal control over financial reporting while the transition to the new accounting software system was in process. As planned, the Company expects to maintain certain of these additional temporary compensating controls following implementation of the new system and will continue to evaluate when and if such controls may be removed. Except for those made in connection with the new accounting software system, there were no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. The Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, does not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1: Legal Proceedings  The legal proceedings described in Note 7 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” are incorporated in this Part II, Item 1 by reference.  FDA Infusion Pump Matter  As previously reported, in February 2007, the Company and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) agreed to a consent decree related to the Alaris SE pumps manufactured or sold in the United States. The FDA recently notified the Company that it seeks to amend and clarify this consent decree to include all infusion pumps. The Company is discussing this matter with the government.      Item 1A: Risk Factors  The information presented below sets forth material changes from the risk factors described in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in the Company’s 2008 Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and information described in the 2008 Form 10-K, the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 and the Company’s other filings with the SEC since June 30, 2008.  Disruptions in the financial market may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to the Company.  The Company’s ability to make scheduled payments or refinance its obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on its operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond its control. Recent disruptions in the financial markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of a number of financial institutions, reduced lending activity, decreased liquidity and higher costs in the commercial paper market and reduced markets for securitizations, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit that the Company has already arranged, and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future, including any financing necessary to consummate the Planned Spin-Off. There can be no assurances that recent government initiatives in response to the disruptions in the financial markets will stabilize the markets in general or increase liquidity and the availability of credit to the Company.    35    Table of Contents Declining economic conditions could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  Disruptions in the financial markets and other macro-economic challenges currently affecting the economy and the economic outlook of the United States and other parts of the world could adversely impact the Company’s customers and vendors in a number of ways, which could adversely affect the Company. Recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending have caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase the Company’s products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change terms of sales. The Company generally sells products to customers with delayed payment terms and frequently is not a secured creditor of those customers. If customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to the Company. Likewise, for similar reasons vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms. Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay the Company for its products or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The Company may not complete the Planned Spin-Off.  There can be no assurance that the Planned Spin-Off will be completed in the manner and timeframe currently contemplated, or at all. The Company may determine not to move forward with the Planned Spin-Off for a number of reasons, including:        •    the Company’s ability to satisfy certain conditions precedent to the Planned Spin-Off, including final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, receipt of confirmation of the tax-free nature of the Planned Spin-Off and the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement for the Planned Spin-Off;        •    changes in business, political and economic conditions in the United States and in other countries in which the Company currently operates;        •    changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of regulatory bodies;        •    changes in operating performance of the Company;        •    the Company’s inability to obtain the financing necessary to consummate the Planned Spin-Off; and        •    the Company’s ability to maintain investment-grade ratings for each of the Company and the spin-off company following the Planned Spin-Off.  Increased demands on the Company’s management team to prepare for and complete the Planned Spin-Off could distract management’s attention from operating the business.  Management currently estimates that the Planned Spin-Off will be completed by the middle of calendar 2009. The complexity of effecting the Planned Spin-Off will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources, as well as the use of numerous cross-functional project teams. The increased demands on the Company’s management team to plan and complete the Planned Spin-Off during this period could distract management’s attention from fulfilling its regular responsibilities, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.  The Company and the spin-off company may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Planned Spin-Off, and the Planned Spin-Off may adversely affect the businesses of the independent companies.  Each, or either, of the Company and the spin-off company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Planned Spin-Off, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. For example, there can be no assurance that analysts and investors will regard the corporate structures of each of the independent companies as more clear and simple than the current Company corporate structure or place a greater value on the sum of each of the independent companies as compared to the current Company. Furthermore, even if some or all of these benefits are achieved, they may not result in the creation of value for the shareholders of the Company or, after the Planned Spin-Off, the shareholders of the spin-off company. There also can be no assurance that the Planned Spin-Off will not adversely affect the businesses of the independent companies.  The Company’s businesses will be less diversified because of the Planned Spin-Off, which may adversely affect the Company’s business and operating results and could result in a lower credit rating, which could also adversely affect the Company’s business.  The Company will have a different operational and financial profile because of the Planned Spin-Off. The Company’s current diversification of revenue sources, resulting from the clinical and medical products businesses that will be spun off and the Company’s other businesses, can have the effect of moderating operational volatility. Following the completion of the Planned Spin-Off, the Company’s diversification of revenue sources will diminish, and, as a result, the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility.    36    Table of Contents Currently, the Company’s senior debt credit ratings from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch are BBB+, Baa2 and BBB+, respectively, and the commercial paper ratings are A-2, P-2 and F2, respectively. The S&P ratings outlook is “stable.” With the announcement of the Planned Spin-Off, Moody’s changed its ratings outlook from “stable” to “review for possible downgrade” and Fitch changed its ratings outlook from “stable” to “ratings watch negative.” It is possible that the Planned Spin-Off could be a factor causing or contributing to a determination by one or more of the rating agencies to lower the credit rating of the Company. Although it will not trigger an acceleration of any of the Company’s indebtedness, a ratings downgrade by any of the ratings agencies may eliminate or significantly diminish the Company’s ability to gain access to the commercial paper market, resulting in the need for the Company to utilize alternative sources of credit at rates that may be higher than would otherwise be available to the Company.  If, following the completion of the Planned Spin-Off, there is a determination that the Planned Spin-Off is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the IRS ruling or tax opinions are incorrect or for any other reason, then the Company and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.  The Planned Spin-Off is conditioned upon the Company’s receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS and opinions of tax counsel confirming that the Planned Spin-Off will generally qualify as tax-free to the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The ruling and opinions will rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from the Company and the new spin-off company regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, the Company and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the Planned Spin-Off is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of the Company or the spin-off company after the Planned Spin-Off. If the Planned Spin-Off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.  In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in the 2008 Form 10-K (which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and/or future business prospects) and the developments disclosed in the Company’s filings with the SEC since the date of the 2008 Form 10-K that relate to the risks described in the 2008 Form 10-K. The risks described in the 2008 Form 10-K are not the only risks that the Company faces. The Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and/or future business prospects could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not known to the Company at the time of the filing of this Form 10-Q or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial.
