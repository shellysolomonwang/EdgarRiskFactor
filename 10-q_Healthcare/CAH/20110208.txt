Item 1A: Risk Factors  The risk factors in the 2010 Form 10-K include a risk factor titled “We may not be able to capture the full benefits from our minority investment in CareFusion” under the heading “Risks associated with the Spin-Off of CareFusion”. Because we disposed of our remaining shares of CareFusion stock, this risk factor is no longer applicable.  The risk factors in the 2010 Form 10-K include a risk factor titled “Our global operations are subject to a number of economic, political and regulatory risks.” We recently acquired Yong Yu, a leading healthcare distribution business in China, in addition to our operations in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Our global operations, including Yong Yu, are subject to the risks described in that risk factor.  The risk factors in the 2010 Form 10-K include a risk factor titled “Acquisitions are not always as successful as we expect them to be.” We recently acquired Kinray and Yong Yu. These acquisitions are subject to the risks described in that risk factor.  The risks described in the 2010 Form 10-K and in this Form 10-Q are not the only risks that we face. You should carefully consider the information in this Form 10-Q and the risk factors and other risks discussed in the 2010 Form 10-K and our filings with the SEC since June 30, 2010. These risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows. Our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations.
