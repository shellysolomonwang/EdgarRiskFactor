Item 1A: Risk Factors”), which are incorporated in this Form 10-Q by reference, and in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q. Except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  Overview  Cardinal Health is a leading provider of products and services that help improve the safety and productivity of healthcare. The Company is one of the largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. The Company also manufactures medication infusion and dispensing products, respiratory equipment and surgical instruments and provides leading technologies and services that help hospitals prevent medication errors, reduce hospital-acquired infections and manage medications and supplies more efficiently. Customers include hospitals and clinics, some of the largest drug store chains in the United States, and many other healthcare providers and retail outlets.  Although the Company has been negatively impacted by the current economic downturn as exhibited by the deferral of hospital capital spending affecting the Clinical and Medical Products segment and increased bad debt expense within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment, customer demand within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment remained relatively strong resulting in increased revenue and segment profit for the three months ended March 31, 2009. Demand for the Company’s products and services during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 led to revenue of $24.9 billion, up 9%, and $74.4 billion, up 9%, respectively, from the same periods in the prior year. Operating earnings were approximately $496 million, down 14%, and $1.5 billion, down 8%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 from the same periods in the prior year. Operating earnings during the three months ended March 31, 2009 were negatively impacted by decreased gross margin ($66 million) offset by a decrease in SG&A expense ($4 million). During the nine months ended March 31, 2009 operating earnings were negatively impacted by increases in SG&A expenses ($71 million) and special items ($37 million) partially offset by increased gross margin ($18 million). Net earnings for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 were $313 million and $878 million, respectively, and net diluted earnings per Common Share were $0.87 and $2.43, respectively. See Note 10 of “Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for a reconciliation of Basic EPS to Diluted EPS.  Cash provided by operating activities totaled $740 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2009, primarily due to earnings. Also included in cash provided by operating activities were $123 million of settlement proceeds related to the termination of certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps. Cash used in investing activities was $269 million primarily due to capital spending ($263 million). Cash used in financing activities was $396 million primarily due to the Company’s repayment of long-term obligations ($310 million). Also during the nine months ended March 31, 2009, the Company paid $150 million in dividends.  Planned Spin-Off of CareFusion Corporation  On September 29, 2008, the Company announced that it intended to separate its clinical and medical products businesses from its other businesses, including its healthcare supply chain services business, through a pro rata distribution to the Company’s shareholders of a wholly owned subsidiary formed for the purpose of holding the clinical and medical products businesses (the “Planned Spin-Off”). The Company will retain certain surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management businesses that are currently part of its Clinical and Medical Products segment. On March 31, 2009, CareFusion Corporation, the subsidiary formed to effect the Planned Spin-Off, filed a Form 10 registration statement for the Planned Spin-Off outlining the Company’s plan to spin off at least 80% of the outstanding common stock of CareFusion through a pro rata distribution to the Company’s shareholders, with the Company retaining the remaining shares of CareFusion common stock. The Company is required to dispose of the shares of CareFusion common stock within five years of the distribution.  The Planned Spin-Off is subject to final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, as well as a number of additional conditions, including, among others:    26    Table of Contents     •    the receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that, among other things, the contribution by the Company of the assets of the clinical and medical products businesses to CareFusion and the distribution will qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code;        •    the receipt of opinions from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, co- counsel to Cardinal Health, to the effect that the contribution and distribution will qualify as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code;        •    the SEC declaring effective the Form 10 registration statement;        •    receipt of investment grade credit ratings for each of the Company and CareFusion; and        •    the completion of the financing necessary for a cash distribution from CareFusion to the Company prior to the Planned Spin-Off.  The Company continues to target the summer of 2009 to complete the Planned Spin-Off, although some of the conditions to completing the transaction may delay the Planned Spin-Off until later in the year. The Company’s goal is to complete the Planned Spin-Off later this calendar year, but no assurance can be provided as to the timing of the Planned Spin-Off or that all conditions to the Planned Spin-Off will be met. See “Part II, Item 1A—Risk Factors” for certain risk factors relating to the Planned Spin-Off.  The Company currently anticipates expenditures associated with the Planned Spin-Off primarily consisting of employee-related costs, costs to start up certain stand-alone functions and information technology systems and other one-time transaction related costs. It expects such expenditures for both companies will be in the range of $200 million to $230 million in the period up to and including the effective date of the Planned Spin-Off, excluding expenditures or costs relating to taxes.  Consolidated Results of Operations  The following summarizes the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008:                                  Three Months EndedMarch 31,     Nine Months EndedMarch 31,     (in millions, except per Common Share amounts)   Change (1)     2009     2008     Change (1)     2009     2008     Revenue   9 %   $ 24,938.7     $ 22,909.6     9 %   $ 74,385.4     $ 68,165.8     Cost of products sold   10 %     23,537.0       21,441.8     10 %     70,202.8       64,001.1                                               Gross margin   (5 )%   $ 1,401.7     $ 1,467.8     —  %   $ 4,182.6     $ 4,164.7     Selling, general and administrative expenses   (1 )%     850.2       854.5     3 %     2,584.2       2,513.5     Impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net   N.M.       3.0       1.2     N.M.       13.5       (22.0 )   Special items   N.M.       52.2       35.6     N.M.       124.4       87.7                                               Operating earnings   (14 )%   $ 496.3     $ 576.5     (8 )%   $ 1,460.5     $ 1,585.5     Interest expense and other   94 %     60.4       31.1     49 %     185.3       124.0                                               Earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations   (20 )%   $ 435.9     $ 545.4     (13 )%   $ 1,275.2     $ 1,461.5     Provision for income taxes   (32 )%     122.4       179.5     (16 )%     393.1       467.2                                               Earnings from continuing operations   (14 )%   $ 313.5     $ 365.9     (11 )%   $ 882.1     $ 994.3     Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax   N.M.

Not meaningful    (1) Change is calculated as the percentage increase or (decrease) for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same periods in the prior year.  Revenue  Revenue for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 increased $2.0 billion or 9% and $6.2 billion or 9%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were due to pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased volume from existing customers (the combined impact of pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased volume was $1.8 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively), the addition of new customers ($275 million and $787 million, respectively) and the impact of acquisitions ($252 million and $672 million, respectively). The Company uses the internal metric “pharmaceutical price appreciation index” to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical and consumer product price appreciation on revenue from the pharmaceutical supply chain     27    Table of Contents  business. This metric is calculated using the change in the manufacturer’s published price at the beginning of the period as compared to the end of the period weighted by the units sold by the pharmaceutical supply chain business during the period. The pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 8.7% for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2009. Revenue was negatively impacted during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 by the loss of customers ($133 million and $1.1 billion, respectively) and foreign exchange ($75 million and $135 million, respectively). Refer to “Segment Results of Operations” below for further discussion of the specific factors affecting revenue in each of the Company’s reportable segments.  Cost of Products Sold   Cost of products sold for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 increased $2.1 billion or 10% and $6.2 billion or 10%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in cost of products sold was mainly due to the respective 9% increases in revenue for both the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same periods in the prior year. See the “Gross Margin” discussion below for further discussion of additional factors impacting cost of products sold.  Gross Margin  Gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2009 decreased $66 million or 5% and was flat for the nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decline in gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2009 reflects a deferral in hospital capital spending, Alaris product recalls and reserves and the corrective action plan submitted to the FDA, and a hold on shipping certain infusion products within the Clinical and Medical Products segment. See Note 7 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for more information regarding the corrective action plan and the hold of shipping certain infusion products. The year-over-year impact of the Alaris product recalls and reserves was $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009. In addition, gross margin was negatively impacted for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 by an increase in customer discounts within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment ($72 million and $252 million, respectively). This increase was primarily due to increased sales volumes. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange ($35 million and $73 million, respectively). Gross margin was favorably impacted by the 9% growth in revenue for both the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009, which included the impact of acquisitions ($42 million and $130 million, respectively). Gross margin was also favorably impacted by increased distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation (combined impact of $35 million and $113 million, respectively) and increased manufacturer cash discounts ($33 million and $108 million, respectively) within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment. The increased distribution service agreement fees and manufacturer cash discounts were primarily the result of increased sales volume. Refer to the “Segment Results of Operations” below for further discussion of the specific factors affecting gross margin in each of the Company’s reportable segments.  Due to the competitive markets in which the Company’s businesses operate, the Company expects competitive pricing pressures to continue; however, the Company expects the margin impact of these pricing pressures over the long-term will be mitigated through effective product sourcing, realization of synergies through integration of acquired businesses and continued focus on cost controls.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  SG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2009 decreased $4 million or 1% compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to disciplined cost controls, including headcount reductions, and a reduction in incentive compensation expense ($18 million). SG&A expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2009 increased $71 million or 3% compared to the same period in the prior year primarily in support of revenue growth, which included the impact of acquisitions, net of divestitures ($56 million). SG&A expenses for both the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 were negatively impacted by increases in bad debt expense ($15 million and $31 million, respectively) driven by the general economic conditions impacting certain customers and bankruptcy filings by three regional chain customers within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment. The Company is continuing to closely monitor its portfolio of outstanding accounts receivable to identify and mitigate customer credit risk; however, future results could be adversely impacted if there is a deterioration in the financial condition of one or more customers. Refer to “Segment Results of Operations” below for further discussion of the specific factors affecting SG&A expenses in each of the Company’s reportable segments.  The Company expects fiscal 2009 SG&A expenses to increase moderately compared to the prior fiscal year in support of sales growth and new product and service offerings and as a result of the impact of acquisitions and increased investment in research and development and information technology projects; however, the Company has generated expense efficiencies through the integration of acquired companies and other cost controls. The Company does not expect share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2009 to be materially different from the prior fiscal year.  Impairments, (Gain)/Loss on Sale of Assets and Other, Net  The Company recognized impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net of $3 million and $14 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared to $1 million and $(22) million, respectively, for the three and nine     28    Table of Contents  months ended March 31, 2008. During the nine months ended March 31, 2008, the Company divested an investment within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment. As a result of the divestiture, the Company recognized a $23 million gain in impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net. See Note 2 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for detail of activity during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008.  Special Items  The following is a summary of the Company’s special items for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008:                        Three Months EndedMarch 31,   Nine Months EndedMarch 31,   (in millions)   2009   2008   2009   2008   Restructuring charges   $ 48.1   $ 8.5   $ 112.1   $ 54.7   Acquisition integration charges     3.5     4.4     11.8     19.9   Litigation and other     0.6     22.7     0.5     13.1                             Total special items   $ 52.2   $ 35.6   $ 124.4   $ 87.7  During the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company recognized restructuring charges of $48 million primarily related to the Planned Spin-Off ($37 million) and headcount reductions within the Clinical and Medical Products segment ($8 million). During the nine months ended March 31, 2009, the Company recognized restructuring charges of $112 million primarily related to the Planned Spin-Off ($52 million), restructuring of the Company’s segment operating structure ($39 million), and headcount reductions within the Clinical and Medical Products segment ($8 million). During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008, the Company recognized expense of $22 million and $33 million, respectively, related to charges incurred for several litigation matters; however, the Company also recognized income of $23 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2008 related to the settlement of the Derivatives Actions discussed in the 2008 Form 10-K. See Note 2 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional detail of the Company’s special items during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008.  The Company estimates it will incur additional costs in future periods associated with various acquisition integration and restructuring activities totaling approximately $198 million (approximately $135 million net of tax). These estimated costs are primarily due to costs associated with the Planned Spin-Off in the period up to and including the effective date of the spin-off and headcount reductions within the Clinical and Medical Products segment.  Operating Earnings  Operating earnings decreased $80 million or 14% and $125 million or 8%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease during the three months ended March 31, 2009 was primarily due to a lower gross margin ($66 million) and increased restructuring charges ($40 million), partially offset by decreased litigation and other charges ($22 million). The decrease during the nine months ended March 31, 2009 was primarily due to increased SG&A expenses ($71 million), increased restructuring charges ($57 million) and increased impairment, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net ($36 million), partially offset by higher gross margin ($18 million) and decreased litigation and other charges ($13 million).  Interest Expense and Other  Interest expense and other increased $29 million or 94% and $61 million or 49%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and other items ($25 million and $59 million, respectively). Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was flat and decreased $18 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2009 due to the favorable impact of interest rate swaps on fixed rate debt.  The Company expects higher interest expense and other for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year as the favorable impact of foreign exchange that was experienced in fiscal 2008 is not expected to continue in fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2009 foreign exchange impact has been unfavorable year to date. Partially offsetting the foreign exchange impact, the Company expects decreased interest expense as a result of its interest rate swaps of fixed rate debt.  In addition, on March 20, 2009, the Company terminated certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps and received settlement proceeds totaling $123 million on March 24, 2009. There was no immediate impact to the statement of earnings; however, the settlement proceeds will be amortized over the life of the underlying debt as a reduction to interest expense.    29    Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes  The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years ending June 30, 2001 through the current fiscal year.  The IRS currently has ongoing audits of fiscal years 2001 through 2007. During the three months ended March 31, 2008, the Company received NPAs from the IRS related to fiscal years 2001 through 2005 challenging deductions arising from the sale of trade receivables to a special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity as described in more detail in Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2008 Form 10-K. The amount of additional tax, excluding penalties and interest which may be significant, proposed by the IRS in these notices was $179 million. The Company disagrees with the proposed adjustments and intends to vigorously contest them. The Company anticipates that this transaction could be the subject of proposed adjustments by the IRS in tax audits of fiscal years 2006 to present. The Company, in normal course, terminated the transaction during the second quarter of fiscal 2009.  During the nine months ended March 31, 2009, the Company received an IRS Revenue Agent Report for tax years 2003 through 2005 which included the NPAs discussed above and new NPAs related to transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among subsidiaries of an acquired entity prior to its acquisition by the Company. The amount of additional tax proposed by the IRS in these notices total $598 million, excluding penalties and interest which may be significant. The Company disagrees with these proposed adjustments and intends to vigorously contest them.  If the two preceding matters are not resolved in the Company’s favor, they may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. See Note 6 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for more information on these matters.  The Company’s effective tax rate was 28.1% and 30.8%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009, as compared to 32.9% and 32.0%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008. Generally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are primarily due to changes within international and state effective tax rates resulting from the Company’s business mix and changes in the tax impact of special items and other discrete items, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.  During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009, the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by various discrete tax adjustments totaling $32 million and $48 million, respectively. The total adjustments of $32 million recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2009 are primarily the result of two items. The first item related to the filing of a claim with the IRS to amend the filing position taken on the Company’s federal income tax return for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 for a transaction that qualifies as a secured loan for tax purposes. As a result of filing the tax refund claim, the Company recognized a $24 million net tax benefit, or a 5.6 percentage point reduction to the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2009. The second item was a favorable tax adjustment of $6 million, or a 1.5 percentage point reduction to the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2009, as the result of the release of a valuation allowance that had previously been established for capital losses for which the Company’s ability to utilize were uncertain.  In addition to the impact of the discrete items discussed above, the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was adversely impacted by 1.6 percentage points due to the non-deductibility of certain special items related to the Planned Spin-Off.  See Note 6 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on the Company’s provision for income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits.  Loss from Discontinued Operations  See Note 4 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for information on the Company’s discontinued operations.  Segment Results of Operations  Reportable Segments  During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company reorganized its businesses into three reportable segments — the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment, the Clinical and Medical Products segment and the All Other segment — in order to reduce costs and align resources with the needs of each segment. The Company evaluates the performance of the individual segments based upon, among other things, segment profit. Segment profit is segment revenue less segment cost of products sold, less segment SG&A expenses. Segment SG&A expense includes equity compensation expense as well as allocated corporate expenses for shared functions, including corporate management, corporate finance, financial shared services, human resources, information technology,     30    Table of Contents  legal and legislative affairs and an integrated hospital sales organization. Information about interest income and expense and income taxes is not provided at the segment level. In addition, special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net are not allocated to the segments. See Note 12 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on the Company’s reportable segments.  The following table summarizes segment revenue for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008:                                  Three Months EndedMarch 31,     Nine Months EndedMarch 31,     (in millions, except growth rates)   Change (1)     2009     2008     Change (1)     2009     2008     Healthcare Supply Chain Services   9 %   $ 23,957.6     $ 21,923.1     9 %   $ 71,472.1     $ 65,362.4     Clinical and Medical Products   (6 )%     1,100.0       1,170.2     4 %     3,469.4       3,335.7     All Other   (20 )%     245.8       308.1     (13 )%     783.9       902.8                                               Total segment revenue   8 %     25,303.4       23,401.4     9 %     75,725.4       69,600.9     Corporate (2)   N.M.

(2) Investment spending previously held at Corporate has been allocated to the segments under the new segment structure. Prior period information has been reclassified to conform to this new presentation. See Note 17 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2008 Form 10-K for an explanation of investment spending.    (3) For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, Corporate includes special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net, which are not allocated to the segments.  Healthcare Supply Chain Services Performance  Healthcare Supply Chain Services revenue growth of $2.0 billion or 9% and $6.1 billion or 9%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to additional volume from existing customers and pharmaceutical price appreciation (the combined impact of pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased volume from existing customers was $1.8 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively). The pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 8.7% for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2009. Revenue was also positively impacted by the addition of new customers ($256 million and $702 million, respectively). Revenue growth was negatively impacted by the loss of customers ($133 million and $1.1 billion, respectively).  Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment profit increased $6 million or 2% during the three months ended March 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Segment profit was positively impacted by an increase in gross margin of $7 million and a minor decrease in SG&A for the three months ended March 31, 2009. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation (combined impact of $35 million) and increased manufacturer cash discounts ($33 million). The increased distribution service agreement fees and manufacturer cash discounts were primarily the result of increased sales volume. Gross margin was negatively impacted by increased customer discounts ($72 million) as a result of increased sales volume. The Company expects a certain level of continued pricing pressure due to the competitive market in which it operates. SG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2009 decreased slightly compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to disciplined cost controls     31    Table of Contents  partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense ($16 million) primarily due to the general economic conditions impacting certain customers and bankruptcy filings by three regional chain customers.  Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment profit decreased $30 million or 3% during the nine months ended March 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Segment profit was positively impacted by an increase in gross margin of $14 million and was negatively impacted by an increase in SG&A of $44 million. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation (combined impact of $113 million), increased manufacturer cash discounts ($108 million) and increased margin from generic pharmaceuticals ($40 million) primarily due to the impact of generic launches during the first half of fiscal 2009. The increased distribution service agreement fees and manufacturer cash discounts were primarily the result of increased sales volume. Gross margin was negatively impacted by increased customer discounts ($252 million) as a result of increased sales volume. SG&A expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2009 were negatively impacted by an increase in bad debt expense ($30 million) primarily due to the general economic conditions impacting certain customers and bankruptcy filings by three regional chain customers.  The Company’s results could be adversely affected if sales of pharmaceutical products decline, competitive pricing pressure intensifies, the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches decreases, generic price deflation increases, or pharmaceutical price appreciation on branded products decreases. Alternatively, the Company’s results could benefit if sales of pharmaceutical products increase, the Company is able to increase its gross margin, the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches increases, generic price deflation decreases, or pharmaceutical price appreciation on branded products increases.  Bulk and Non-Bulk Customers. The Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment differentiates between bulk and non-bulk customers with respect to the distribution of pharmaceutical, radiopharmaceutical and over-the-counter healthcare products because bulk customers generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than that generated by non-bulk customers. Hereinafter all references to bulk and non-bulk customers are confined to the product categories above. Bulk customers consist of customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses. All other customers are classified as non-bulk customers (for example, retail stores, pharmacies, hospitals and alternate care sites). Bulk customers include the warehouse operations of retail chains whose retail stores are classified as non-bulk customers. A single retail chain pharmacy customer may be both a bulk customer with respect to its warehouse operations and a non-bulk customer with respect to its retail stores. Bulk customers have the ability to process large quantities of products in central locations and self-distribute these products to their individual retail stores or customers. Substantially all deliveries to bulk customers consist of product shipped in the same form as the product is received from the manufacturer, but a small portion of deliveries to bulk customers are broken down into smaller units prior to shipping. Non-bulk customers, on the other hand, require more complex servicing by the Company. These services, all of which are performed by the Company, include receiving inventory in large or full case quantities and breaking it down into smaller quantities, warehousing the product for a longer period of time, picking individual products specific to a customer’s order and delivering that smaller order to a customer location.  The Company tracks revenue by bulk and non-bulk customers in its financial systems. An internal analysis has been prepared to estimate segment profit from bulk and non-bulk customers by allocating segment expenses (total of segment cost of products sold and segment SG&A expenses) separately for bulk and non-bulk customers. The following table shows the allocation of segment expenses, segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008:                            Three Months EndedMarch 31,     Nine Months EndedMarch 31,     (in millions, except percentage of revenue)   2009     2008     2009     2008     Non-bulk customers:                       Revenue from non-bulk customers   $ 11,083     $ 10,737     $ 32,578     $ 31,638     Segment expenses allocated to non-bulk customers (1)   $ 10,853     $ 10,499     $ 31,937     $ 30,955     Segment profit from non-bulk customers (1)   $ 230     $ 238     $ 641     $ 683     Segment profit from non-bulk customers as a percentage of revenue from non-bulk customers (1)     2.1 %     2.2 %     2.0 %     2.2 %   Bulk customers:                       Revenue from bulk customers   $ 10,824     $ 9,124     $ 32,678     $ 27,756     Segment expenses allocated to bulk customers (1)   $ 10,766     $ 9,074     $ 32,550     $ 27,616     Segment profit from bulk customers (1)   $ 58     $ 50     $ 128     $ 140     Segment profit from bulk customers as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers (1)     0.5 %     0.5 %     0.4 %     0.5 %      (1)  Amounts shown are estimates based upon the internal analysis described above. The preparation of this internal analysis required the use of complex and subjective estimates and allocations based upon assumptions, past experience and judgment that the Company believes are reasonable. The core pharmaceutical distribution operation (“Distribution”) services both bulk and non-bulk customers. Therefore, expenses associated with this operation were allocated between bulk and non-bulk     32    Table of Contents       customers as described below. The brokerage operation (“Brokerage”) only services bulk customers, therefore, expenses associated with Brokerage are allocated to bulk customers. The remaining operations (i.e., excluding Distribution) service non-bulk customers, therefore, expenses associated with these operations were allocated to non-bulk customers.  The following describes the allocation of the major components of cost of products sold for Distribution between bulk and non-bulk customers:        •    Cost of products sold for pharmaceutical products is determined by specifically tracking the manufacturer’s designated price of products, at the time the products are sold, by bulk and non-bulk customers. The manufacturer’s designated price is then reduced by other components impacting cost of products sold, including distribution service agreement fees, pharmaceutical price appreciation, manufacturer cash discounts and manufacturer rebates and incentives. In addition, other inventory charges and credits are added or subtracted, as appropriate, to arrive at cost of products sold. The Company used the following methods that it believes provide a reasonable correlation to allocate the remaining components of cost of products sold between bulk and non-bulk customers:        •    Distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation are tracked by manufacturer. Therefore, the Company allocated the distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation associated with each manufacturer among their products in proportion to sales of each product between bulk and non-bulk customers.        •    Manufacturer cash discounts are recognized as a reduction to cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold and were allocated in proportion to the manufacturer’s published price of the product sold to bulk and non-bulk customers.        •    Manufacturers’ rebates and incentives are based on the individual agreements entered into with manufacturers related to specific products. Rebates and incentives were grouped by contract terms and then allocated in proportion to sales to bulk and non-bulk customers.        •    Other inventory charges and credits include charges for outdated and returned inventory items and fluctuation in inventory reserves. The Company estimated the portion of these inventory charges and credits attributable to each product and then allocated them to bulk and non-bulk customers in proportion to the sales of these products.  The Company used methods that it believes provide a reasonable correlation to allocate the SG&A expenses for Distribution between bulk and non-bulk customers as follows:        •    Warehouse expense includes labor-related expenses associated with receiving, shipping and handling the inventory as well as warehouse storage costs including insurance, taxes, supplies and other facility costs. Warehouse expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoice line items filled for each bulk or non-bulk customer because the Company believes that there is a correlation between the number of different products ordered as reflected in invoice lines and the level of effort associated with receiving, shipping and handling that order (bulk customers typically order substantially larger quantities of products and therefore generate substantially fewer invoice lines which results in substantially less warehouse expense being allocated to bulk customers);        •    Delivery expense includes transportation costs associated with physically moving the product from the warehouse to the customer’s designated location. Delivery expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoices generated for each bulk or non-bulk customer on the assumption that each invoice generates a delivery;        •    Sales expense includes personnel-related costs associated with sales and customer service activities (such activities are the same for both bulk and non-bulk customers). Sales expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoices generated for each bulk or non-bulk customer because customer invoices are a reasonable estimate of the amount of customer service calls and sales effort; and        •    General and administrative expenses were allocated in proportion to the units of products sold to bulk or non-bulk customers. These expenses were allocated on the assumption that general and administrative expenses increase or decrease in direct relation to the volume of sales.  The internal analysis indicated segment expenses as a percentage of revenue were higher for bulk customers than for non-bulk customers because of higher segment cost of products sold partially offset by lower segment SG&A expenses. Bulk customers receive lower pricing on sales of the same products than non-bulk customers due to volume pricing in a competitive market and the lower costs related to the services provided by the Company. In addition, sales to bulk customers in aggregate generate higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than sales to non-bulk customers because bulk customers’ orders consist almost entirely of higher cost branded products. The higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is also driven by lower manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and branded pharmaceutical price appreciation and lower manufacturer cash discounts. Manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and manufacturer cash discounts are recognized as a reduction to segment cost of products sold and are lower as a percentage of revenue     33    Table of Contents  due to the mix of products sold. Pharmaceutical price appreciation increases customer pricing which, in turn, results in higher segment gross margin for sales of inventory that was on-hand at the time of the manufacturer’s price increase. Since products sold to bulk customers are generally held in inventory for a shorter time than products sold to non-bulk customers, there is less opportunity to realize the benefit of pharmaceutical price appreciation. Consequently, segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is higher than for non-bulk customers and segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue is substantially lower for bulk customers than for non-bulk customers. Deliveries to bulk customers require substantially less services by the Company than deliveries to non-bulk customers. As such, segment SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers are substantially lower than from non-bulk customers. These factors result in segment profit as a percentage of revenue being significantly lower for bulk customers than for non-bulk customers.  The Company defines bulk and non-bulk customers based on the way in which the Company operates its business and the services it performs for its customers. The Company is not aware of an industry standard regarding the definition of bulk customers and based solely on a review of the Annual Reports on Form 10-K of other national pharmaceutical wholesalers, the Company notes that other companies in comparable businesses may, or may not, use a different definition of bulk customers.  During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009, revenue from non-bulk customers increased $346 million and $940 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to increased volume from existing customers. Segment profit from non-bulk customers decreased $8 million and $42 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to increased customer discounts as a result of increased sales volume partially offset by increased manufacturer cash discounts and an increase in margin from generic pharmaceuticals. In addition, non-bulk results were negatively impacted by one of the Company’s largest customers moving certain business from non-bulk to bulk late in fiscal 2008.  During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009, revenue from bulk customers increased $1.7 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to increased volume from existing customers and new customers. Segment profit from bulk customers increased $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased manufacturer cash discounts, partially offset by increased customer discounts as a result of increased sales volume. Segment profit from bulk customers decreased $12 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increased customer discounts partially offset by increased distribution service agreement, pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased manufacturer cash discounts. In addition, bulk results were positively impacted by one of the Company’s largest customers moving certain businesses from non-bulk to bulk late in fiscal 2008. Clinical and Medical Products Performance  During the three months ended March 31, 2009, Clinical and Medical Products revenue and segment profit declined compared to the same period in the prior year. The declines were primarily driven by the deferral in hospital capital spending and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange partially offset by the Enturia acquisition. Additionally, segment profit was negatively impacted by Alaris product recalls and reserves and the corrective action plan submitted to the FDA, and a hold on shipping certain infusion products. The Company expects the deferral in hospital capital spending referenced above to have an adverse impact on the Clinical and Medical Products segment results for at least the remainder of calendar year 2009 and the hold on shipping certain infusion products referenced above to have an adverse impact on the Clinical and Medical Products segment results for the remainder of fiscal 2009. Clinical and Medical Products segment revenue declined $70 million or 6% during the three months ended March 31, 2009 and increased $134 million or 4% during the nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same periods in the prior year. In addition to the factors described above, during the three months ended March 31, 2009, the decline in revenue was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange ($44 million) and decreased volume from existing customers ($19 million) partially offset by acquisitions ($49 million). During the nine months ended March 31, 2009, the increase in revenue was primarily due to acquisitions ($153 million) and new products ($47 million) partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange ($68 million).  Clinical and Medical Products segment profit decreased $42 million or 22% during the three months ended March 31, 2009 and increased $7 million or 1% during the nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared to the prior year periods. In addition to the factors described above, gross margin decreased segment profit by $54 million during the three months ended March 31, 2009 primarily as a result of the revenue decline and by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange ($26 million) and an increase in raw material cost ($14 million) partly offset by the favorable impact of acquisitions ($32 million). Gross margin increased segment profit by $35 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2009 primarily as a result of revenue growth and acquisitions ($97 million), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange ($51 million) and an increase in raw material costs ($52 million). In addition, negatively impacting segment profit for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 was an $18 million charge for product recalls and reserves and the corrective action plan submitted to the FDA. Product recalls and reserves were $7 million and $21 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008, respectively. Decreases in SG&A expenses positively impacted segment profit by $12 million during the three months ended March 31, 2009 primarily due to cost control initiatives. Increases in SG&A expenses decreased segment profit by $27 million during the nine months     34    Table of Contents  ended March 31, 2009 primarily due to the impact of acquisitions ($52 million), which were partially offset by the favorable impact of cost control initiatives.  All Other Performance  All Other segment revenue declined $62 million or 20% and $119 million or 13%, respectively during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared to the prior year periods. The revenue decline was driven by lost customers ($24 million and $60 million, respectively), the divestiture of the Medsystems and Tecomet businesses ($20 million and $41 million, respectively) and the closing of several company-owned Medicine Shoppe stores ($19 million and $25 million, respectively).  All Other segment profit decreased $3 million or 12% and increased $4 million or 6%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared to the prior year periods. A decline in gross margin decreased segment profit by $14 million and $20 million and a decline in SG&A expenses increased segment profit by $11 million and $25 million during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009, respectively.  In addition, positively impacting revenue and segment profit for the All Other segment for the nine months ended March 31, 2009 was $14 million in Medicine Shoppe franchise termination fees.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Sources and Uses of Cash  The following table summarizes the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008:                    Nine Months EndedMarch 31,     (in millions)   2009     2008     Net cash provided by/(used in)             Operating activities   $ 739.6     $ 1,269.8     Investing activities   $ (269.0 )   $ (148.4 )   Financing activities   $ (395.9 )   $ (901.2 )  Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2009 totaled $740 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2008 of $1.3 billion. The decrease in net cash from operating activities was primarily a result of an increase in working capital in the current period compared to a decrease in working capital in the prior year period. The most significant changes in working capital were increased inventories ($1.3 billion) and increased trade receivables ($870 million), partially offset by increased accounts payable ($1.6 billion). These increases were due primarily to Healthcare Supply Chain Services revenue growth as well as the timing of inventory purchases, receipts and payments. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors during the regular course of business.  In addition, on March 20, 2009, the Company terminated certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps and received settlement proceeds totaling $123 million on March 24, 2009. The proceeds are classified as cash provided by operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.  Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities of $269 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2009 primarily reflected capital spending ($263 million).  Net cash used in investing activities of $148 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2008 reflected capital spending ($252 million) partially offset by the net proceeds from the sale of short-term investments classified as available for sale ($132 million). In addition, the Company utilized cash to complete the Viasys acquisition within the Clinical and Medical Products segment slightly offset by cash received for the divestiture of an investment within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment (combined impact of $39 million).  Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities of $396 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2009 reflected the Company’s repayment of long-term obligations ($310 million) and dividend payments to shareholders ($150 million). See “Capital Resources” below for further discussion of the Company’s financing activities.  Net cash used in financing activities of $901 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2008 reflected the Company’s     35    Table of Contents  repurchase of its Common Shares ($1.2 billion) and dividend payments to shareholders ($130 million). Cash provided by financing activities included proceeds received from shares issued under various employee stock plans ($209 million) and the net change in commercial paper and short-term borrowings ($202 million).  Share Repurchase Program  During the nine months ended March 31, 2009, the Company did not purchase any of its Common Shares under its existing $2.0 billion share repurchase program announced on August 8, 2007. This repurchase authorization will expire on August 31, 2009. At March 31, 2009, approximately $1.3 billion remained from the $2.0 billion repurchase authorization. The Company does not expect additional share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2009.  See the table under “Part II, Item 2” of this Form 10-Q for more information regarding these repurchases.  Capital Resources  The Company’s cash and equivalents balance was $1.4 billion at March 31, 2009 compared to $1.3 billion at June 30, 2008. The cash balance at March 31, 2009 was affected by the July 2008 repayment of $150 million of 6.25% notes due 2008, repayment of $149 million for the preferred debt securities (see discussion below for further information) in October 2008 and by net cash provided by operating activities of $740 million, which was driven by earnings as described above.  The Company’s cash and equivalents balance as of March 31, 2009 included $562 million of cash held by its subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject it to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. The U.S. parent of the Company may temporarily access cash held by foreign subsidiaries without subjecting it to U.S. federal income tax through intercompany loans. A notice issued by the IRS in October 2008 announced that the U.S. Treasury Department will issue regulations that will, for a temporary period, extend the permitted duration of such intercompany loans that qualify for suspended deemed dividend treatment under Section 956 of the Code. Such intercompany loans from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent must be repaid within 60 days from commencement and cannot exceed 180 cumulative days during the year. At March 31, 2009 and June 30, 2008, the intercompany loan balance of the Company totaled $182 million and $0 million, respectively (cash held by foreign subsidiaries prior to the loan at March 31, 2009 was $744 million). The position set forth in the notice will apply for the Company until June 30, 2010.  In addition to cash, the Company’s sources of liquidity include a $1.5 billion commercial paper program backed by a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a committed receivables sales facility program with the capacity to sell $850 million in receivables (on May 1, 2009, the Company amended its committed receivables sales facility program to increase the purchase limit from $850 million to $950 million). The Company had no outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program at March 31, 2009. Due to general market conditions, market demand for the Company’s A-2, P-2 and F2-rated commercial paper during the six months ended December 31, 2008 was limited; however, the market has improved since the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009, and the Company issued up to $400 million of commercial paper during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The Company had no outstanding balance under the committed receivables sales facility program at March 31, 2009.  The Company terminated certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps and received settlement proceeds totaling $123 million on March 24, 2009. The proceeds are classified as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. There was no immediate impact to the statement of earnings; however, the settlement proceeds will be amortized over the life of the underlying debt as a reduction to interest expense.  During fiscal 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to periodically sell trade receivables to a special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity (the “Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity”), which was exclusively engaged in purchasing trade receivables from, and making loans to, the Company. The Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity, which was consolidated by the Company as it was the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity, issued preferred variable debt securities to parties not affiliated with the Company. On October 3, 2008, the Company repaid the remaining balance of $149 million for the preferred debt securities and the agreement was terminated.  The Company’s capital resources are more fully described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 5, 10 and 19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2008 Form 10-K.  The Company currently believes that, based upon existing cash, operating cash flows, available capital resources (as discussed above) and other available market transactions, it has adequate capital resources at its disposal to fund currently anticipated capital expenditures, business growth and expansion, working capital needs, contractual obligations and current and projected debt service requirements, including those related to business combinations.    36    Table of Contents From time to time, the Company considers and engages in acquisition transactions in order to expand its role as a leading provider of products and services that improve the safety and productivity of healthcare. The Company evaluates possible candidates for acquisition and considers opportunities to expand its role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry through all its reportable segments. If additional transactions are entered into or consummated, the Company may need to enter into funding arrangements for such acquisitions.  Debt Ratings/Covenants  The Company’s senior debt credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) are BBB+, Baa2 and BBB+, respectively, and the commercial paper ratings are A-2, P-2 and F2, respectively. The S&P ratings outlook is “stable.” With the announcement of the Planned Spin-Off, Moody’s changed its ratings outlook from “stable” to “review for possible downgrade” and Fitch changed its ratings outlook from “stable” to “ratings watch negative.” It is possible that the Planned Spin-Off could be a factor causing or contributing to a determination by one or more of the rating agencies to lower the credit rating of the Company. Although it will not trigger an acceleration of any of the Company’s indebtedness, a ratings downgrade by any of the ratings agencies may eliminate or significantly diminish the Company’s ability to gain access to the commercial paper market, resulting in the need for the Company to utilize alternative sources of credit at rates that may be higher than would otherwise be available to the Company.  The Company’s various borrowing facilities and long-term debt are free of any financial covenants other than minimum net worth which cannot fall below $5.0 billion at any time. As of March 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with this covenant.  On April 16, 2009, in connection with the Planned Spin-Off, the Company amended its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility to, among other things, replace a minimum net worth covenant with covenants that require the Company to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter of at least 4-to-1 and to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.25-to-1. The new covenants will not become effective until the date on which the Company consummates the Planned Spin-Off, including payment of the contemplated cash distribution from CareFusion to the Company prior to the Planned Spin-Off.  On May 1, 2009, the Company amended its committed sales facility program to replace a minimum net worth covenant in the Performance Guaranty with covenants that require the Company to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter of at least 4-to-1 and to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.25-to-1. The new covenants will not become effective until the date on which the new financial covenants become effective for the Company’s $1.5 billion revolving credit facility as described above.  Contractual Obligations  There have been no material changes, outside of the ordinary course of business, in the Company’s outstanding contractual obligations from those disclosed within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2008 Form 10-K.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Resources” and Note 14 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” above and Note 19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2008 Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements.  Recent Financial Accounting Standards  See Note 1 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards.      Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  The Company believes that there has been no material change in the quantitative and qualitative market risks from those discussed in the 2008 Form 10-K. See “Part II, Item 1A—Risk Factors” for risk factors relating to disruptions in the financial markets.      Item 4: Controls and Procedures  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company carried out an evaluation, as required by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2009. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2009 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and to provide that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.    37    Table of Contents Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. The Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, does not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1: Legal Proceedings  The legal proceedings described in Note 7 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” are incorporated in this Part II, Item 1 by reference.      Item 1A: Risk Factors  The information presented below sets forth material changes from the risk factors described in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in the Company’s 2008 Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and information described in the 2008 Form 10-K, the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2008 and the Company’s other filings with the SEC since June 30, 2008.  Disruptions in the financial market may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to the Company.  The Company’s ability to make scheduled payments or refinance its obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on its operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond its control. The credit and capital markets are experiencing significant volatility that is difficult to predict. Disruptions in the financial markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of a number of financial institutions, reduced lending activity, decreased liquidity and higher costs in the commercial paper market and reduced markets for securitizations, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit that the Company has already arranged, and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future, including any financing necessary to consummate the Planned Spin-Off. There can be no assurances that government initiatives in response to the disruptions in the financial markets will stabilize the markets in general or increase liquidity and the availability of credit to the Company.  Declining economic conditions could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  Disruptions in the financial markets and other macro-economic challenges currently affecting the economy and the economic outlook of the United States and other parts of the world could adversely impact the Company’s customers and vendors in a number of ways, which could adversely affect the Company. Recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending have caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase the Company’s products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change terms of sales. The Company has observed certain hospitals delaying capital equipment purchase decisions, which impacted the Company’s financial results during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The Company expects this delay will have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial results for at least the remainder of calendar 2009. If customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to the Company. Likewise, for similar reasons vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms. Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay the Company for its products or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.    38    Table of Contents The Company may face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform.  Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes. The Company anticipates that the new presidential administration, Congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access. Public debate of these issues will likely continue in the future. The uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation may, while such uncertainties remain unresolved, have an adverse effect on the Company’s customers’ purchasing decisions regarding its products and services. At this time, the Company cannot predict which, if any, healthcare reform proposals will be adopted, when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on the Company.  The Company may not complete the Planned Spin-Off.  There can be no assurance that the Planned Spin-Off will be completed in the manner and timeframe currently contemplated, or at all. The Company may determine not to move forward with the Planned Spin-Off for a number of reasons, including:        •    the Company’s inability to satisfy certain conditions precedent to the Planned Spin-Off, including final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, receipt of confirmation of the tax-free nature of the Planned Spin-Off and the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement for the Planned Spin-Off;        •    changes in business, political and economic conditions in the United States and in other countries in which the Company currently operates;        •    changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of regulatory bodies;        •    changes in operating performance of the Company;        •    the Company’s inability to obtain the financing necessary on acceptable terms to consummate the Planned Spin-Off; and        •    the inability to obtain investment grade credit ratings for each of the Company and CareFusion following the Planned Spin-Off.  Increased demands on the Company’s management team to prepare for and complete the Planned Spin-Off could distract management’s attention from operating the business.  Management continues to target the summer of 2009 to complete the Planned Spin-Off, although some of the conditions to completing the transaction may delay the Planned Spin-Off until later in the year. The complexity of effecting the Planned Spin-Off will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources, as well as the use of numerous cross-functional project teams. The increased demands on the Company’s management team to plan and complete the Planned Spin-Off during this period could distract management’s attention from fulfilling its regular responsibilities, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.  The Company and CareFusion may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Planned Spin-Off, and the Planned Spin-Off may adversely affect the businesses of the independent companies.  Each, or either, of the Company and CareFusion may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Planned Spin-Off, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The targeted benefits include the following:        •    improving strategic planning, increasing management focus and streamlining decision-making by providing the flexibility to implement the unique strategic plans of each of the independent companies and to respond more effectively to different customer needs of each of the independent companies and the changing economic environment;        •    allowing each of the independent companies to adopt the capital structure, investment policy and dividend policy best suited to each business’ financial profile and business needs, as well as resolving the current competition for capital among the Company and its investors; and        •    facilitating incentive compensation arrangements for employees more directly tied to the performance of the relevant company’s business, and enhancing employee hiring and retention by each company by, among other things, improving the alignment of management and employee incentives with performance and growth objectives, while at the same time creating an independent equity structure that will facilitate its ability to effect future acquisitions utilizing its stock.  Each, or either, of the Company and CareFusion may not achieve the anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons. There also can be no assurance that the Planned Spin-Off will not adversely affect the businesses of the independent companies.  The Company’s businesses will be less diversified because of the Planned Spin-Off, which may adversely affect the Company’s business and operating results and could result in a lower credit rating, which could also adversely affect the Company’s business.    39    Table of Contents The Company will have a different operational and financial profile because of the Planned Spin-Off. The Company’s current diversification of revenue sources, resulting from the clinical and medical products businesses that will be spun off and the Company’s other businesses, can have the effect of moderating operational volatility. Following the completion of the Planned Spin-Off, the Company’s diversification of revenue sources will diminish, and, as a result, the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility.  Currently, the Company’s senior debt credit ratings from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch are BBB+, Baa2 and BBB+, respectively, and the commercial paper ratings are A-2, P-2 and F2, respectively. The S&P ratings outlook is “stable.” With the announcement of the Planned Spin-Off, Moody’s changed its ratings outlook from “stable” to “review for possible downgrade” and Fitch changed its ratings outlook from “stable” to “ratings watch negative.” It is possible that the Planned Spin-Off could be a factor causing or contributing to a determination by one or more of the rating agencies to lower the credit rating of the Company. Although it will not trigger an acceleration of any of the Company’s indebtedness, a ratings downgrade by any of the ratings agencies may eliminate or significantly diminish the Company’s ability to gain access to the commercial paper market, resulting in the need for the Company to utilize alternative sources of credit at rates that may be higher than would otherwise be available to the Company.  If, following the completion of the Planned Spin-Off, there is a determination that the Planned Spin-Off is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the IRS ruling or tax opinions are incorrect or for any other reason, then the Company and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.  The Planned Spin-Off is conditioned upon the Company’s receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that that, among other things, the Planned Spin-Off will qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In addition, it is a condition to the distribution that the Company receive opinions of tax counsel to the effect that the Planned Spin-Off will qualify as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The ruling and opinions will rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from the Company and CareFusion regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, the Company and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the Planned Spin-Off is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of the Company or CareFusion after the Planned Spin-Off. If the Planned Spin-Off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.  In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in the 2008 Form 10-K (which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and/or future business prospects) and the developments disclosed in the Company’s filings with the SEC since the date of the 2008 Form 10-K that relate to the risks described in the 2008 Form 10-K. The risks described in the 2008 Form 10-K are not the only risks that the Company faces. The Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and/or future business prospects could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not known to the Company at the time of the filing of this Form 10-Q or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial.
