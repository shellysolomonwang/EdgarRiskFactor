Item 1A: Risk Factors”) and are incorporated in this Form 10-Q by reference. Except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  Overview  Cardinal Health is a leading provider of products and services that improve the safety and productivity of healthcare. The Company is one of the largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies focusing on making supply chains more efficient. Customers include hospitals and clinics, some of the largest drug store chains in the United States and many other healthcare providers and retail outlets. The Company believes that its depth and breadth of products is unique in the industry and gives it a competitive advantage.  Continued demand for the Company’s products and services during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 led to revenue of $23.3 billion, up 7%, and $45.3 billion, up 6%, respectively, from the same period in the prior year. Operating earnings increased 1% and 5%, respectively, to approximately $519 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, and were favorably impacted by increased gross margin ($55 million and $196 million, respectively) offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses ($73 million and $178 million, respectively). Net earnings for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 were $325 million and $627 million, respectively, and net diluted earnings per Common Share were $0.89 and $1.70, respectively.  Cash from operating activities decreased $257 million during the six months ended December 31, 2007 to $383 million compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an overall increase in the Company’s working capital. Cash used in investing activities was $72 million due primarily to capital spending ($172 million) offset by net proceeds from the sale of certain short-term investments classified as available for sale ($132 million). Cash used in financing activities was $435 million due to the Company’s cash payments for treasury shares ($1.0 billion) offset by a net increase in commercial paper and short-term borrowings ($519 million) and proceeds from the issuance of shares ($164 million).  During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased approximately $342 million of its Common Shares under a $4.5 billion repurchase authorization which began during fiscal 2007 and expires on June 30, 2008. On August 8, 2007, the Company announced an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase program which expires on August 31, 2009. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, the Company repurchased approximately $350 million and $600 million of its Common Shares under this new share repurchase program. Also during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, the Company paid $44 million and $88 million, respectively, in dividends or $0.12 and $0.24, respectively, per share.  Consolidated Results of Operations  The following summarizes the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006:    31    Table of Contents                             Three Months EndedDecember 31,   Six Months EndedDecember 31,   (in millions, except per Common Share amounts)   Change (1)     2007     2006   Change (1)     2007     2006   Revenue   7  %   $ 23,282.7     $ 21,784.6   6  %   $ 45,256.1     $ 42,722.1   Cost of products sold   7  %     21,928.1       20,484.7   6  %     42,559.3       40,221.7                                         Gross margin   4  %   $ 1,354.6     $ 1,299.9   8  %   $ 2,696.8     $ 2,500.4   Selling, general and administrative expenses   10  %     828.9       755.8   12  %     1,659.0       1,481.3   Impairment charges and other   N.M.

Revenue  Revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 increased $1.5 billion or 7% and $2.5 billion or 6%, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was due to pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased volume from existing customers (combined impact of volume and pharmaceutical price appreciation was $1.5 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively), the impact of acquisitions ($214 million and $427 million, respectively) and new customers ($159 million and $264 million, respectively). The Company uses the internal metric “pharmaceutical price appreciation index” to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical and consumer product price appreciation on revenue from the pharmaceutical supply chain business. This metric is calculated using the change in the manufacturer’s published price at the beginning of the period as compared to the end of the period weighted by the units sold by the pharmaceutical supply chain business during the period. The pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 6.7% for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2007. Revenue was negatively impacted during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 by the loss of customers ($353 million and $802 million, respectively). Refer to “Segment Results of Operations” below for further discussion of the specific factors affecting revenue in each of the Company’s reportable segments.  Cost of Products Sold  Cost of products sold for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 increased $1.4 billion or 7% and $2.3 billion or 6%, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in cost of products sold was mainly due to the respective 7% and 6% increases in revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year. See the “Gross Margin” discussion below for further discussion of additional factors impacting cost of products sold.  Gross Margin  Gross margin for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 increased $55 million or 4% and $196 million or 8%, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to the respective 7% and 6% growth in revenue, including the impact of acquisitions ($85 million and $162 million, respectively). Gross margin was negatively impacted by an increase in customer discounts within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical segment ($89 million and $159 million, respectively) as a result of increased sales volume, the repricing of several large customer contracts in the second half of fiscal 2007 and the first half of fiscal 2008, and growth of approximately 12% and 11%, respectively, in sales to bulk customers which tend to have larger customer discounts. Refer to the “Segment Results of Operations” below for further discussion of the specific factors affecting gross margin in each of the Company’s reportable segments.    32    Table of Contents Due to the competitive markets in which the Company’s businesses operate, the Company expects competitive pricing pressures to continue; however, the Company expects the margin impact of these pricing pressures over the long-term will be mitigated through sales growth of higher margin manufactured products, effective product sourcing, realization of synergies through integration of acquired businesses and continued focus on cost controls.  Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses  SG&A expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 increased $73 million or 10% and $178 million or 12%, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily in support of revenue growth, which includes the impact of acquisitions ($68 million and $136 million, respectively). SG&A expenses were favorably impacted by a year-over-year reduction in equity-based compensation expense for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year ($5 million and $16 million, respectively). The reduction in equity-based compensation expense was due to changes made to the Company’s employee equity plans. Refer to “Segment Results of Operations” below for further discussion of the specific factors affecting SG&A expenses in each of the Company’s reportable segments.  Impairment Charges and Other  The Company recognized impairment charges and other of $(23) million for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to $13 million and $14 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2006. During the three months ended December 31, 2007, the Company divested an investment within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical segment. As a result of the divestiture, the Company recorded a $23 million gain in impairment charges and other. See Note 2 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional detail of impairment charges and other during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.  Special Items  The following is a summary of the Company’s special items for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006:                          Three Months EndedDecember 31,   Six Months EndedDecember 31,   (in millions)   2007     2006   2007     2006   Restructuring charges   $ 31.5     $ 10.0   $ 46.2     $ 21.8   Acquisition integration charges     10.0       9.1     15.5       11.1   Litigation and other     (12.0 )     0.5     (9.7 )     8.9                                 Total special items   $ 29.5     $ 19.6   $ 52.0     $ 41.8                                During the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized income of $23 million related to the settlement of the Derivatives Actions discussed in Note 7 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.” The income was offset by a charge of $10 million during the three months ended December 31, 2007 related to the settlement of certain litigation in the Company’s Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical segment and a charge of $1 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 with respect to certain pending litigation in the same segment. See Note 2 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional detail of the Company’s special items during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.  Operating Earnings  Operating earnings increased $7 million or 1% and $46 million or 5%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year. Operating earnings were favorably impacted by higher gross margin ($55 million and $196 million, respectively), a gain from the sale of an investment during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 ($23 million) and net favorable litigation settlements during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 ($12 million). Operating earnings were negatively impacted by increased SG&A expenses ($73 million and $178 million, respectively) and increased restructuring and acquisition integration charges ($22 million and $29 million, respectively).    33    Table of Contents Interest Expense and Other  Interest expense and other increased $18 million or 54% and $23 million or 33%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased borrowing levels and the impact of the prior year allocation of interest expense to discontinued operations (combined impact of $20 million and $38 million, respectively). The increase in interest expense was partially offset by increased investment income ($6 million and $12 million, respectively) and the favorable impact of foreign exchange ($2 million and $8 million, respectively).  Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations for the PTS Business was $9 million and $17 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, respectively. Interest expense was allocated based upon a ratio of the invested capital of the PTS Business versus the overall invested capital of the Company. Upon divesting the PTS Business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, interest expense remained in continuing operations.  Provision for Income Taxes  Effective July 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” This interpretation provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. This interpretation also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The cumulative effect of adoption of this interpretation was a $139.3 million reduction of retained earnings.  As of July 1, 2007, the Company had $596.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits. Included in the total amount of $596.6 million is $386.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would have an impact on the effective tax rate. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty as to the timing of such deductibility and to tax positions in the amount of $21.0 million related to acquired companies. Recognition of these tax benefits would not affect the Company’s effective tax rate. The entire $596.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits is included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of July 1, 2007, the Company had $148.9 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties, which is a gross amount before any tax benefits. The entire $148.9 million of accrued interest and penalties is included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  During the six-month period ended December 31, 2007, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased to $641.9 million.  The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years ending June 30, 2001 through the current fiscal year. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) currently has ongoing audits of open fiscal years from 2001 through 2005. During the three months ended December 31, 2007, the Company was notified that the IRS has transferred jurisdiction over fiscal years 2001 and 2002 from the Office of Appeals back to the Examinations level to reconsider previously-unadjusted specific issues. Although it is not possible to predict the timing of the conclusion of the ongoing audits with accuracy, the Company anticipates that the examination phase of the 2001 through 2005 IRS audits could be completed within the next 12 months. If this were to occur, it is reasonably     34    Table of Contents  possible that there could be a change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits. However, based on the current status of all ongoing audits and the protocol of finalizing audits by the relevant tax authorities (which could include formal legal proceedings), it is not possible to estimate the impact of any amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.  Provision for Income Taxes – Continuing Operations  The Company’s provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax earnings from continuing operations (“effective tax rate”) was 30.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2007, and 31.4% for the six months ended December 31, 2007. Generally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are primarily due to changes within international and state effective tax rates resulting from the Company’s business mix and changes in the tax impact of special items and other discrete items, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.  The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2007 was benefited by $8.9 million or 1.2 percentage points as a result of the release of a valuation allowance that had previously been established with respect to an investment within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical segment which was divested during the second quarter of fiscal 2008. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2007 was benefited by 1.1 percentage points due to the mix of special items and impairment charges being deductible at effective tax rates higher than the average effective tax rate.  Provision for Income Taxes—Discontinued Operations  The Company’s benefit for income taxes on discontinued operations was $416.1 million and $435.9 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, respectively. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recognized a $425.0 million net tax benefit related to the difference between the Company’s tax basis in the stock of the PTS Business included in discontinued operations and the book basis of the Company’s investment in those businesses.  Earnings/(Loss) from Discontinued Operations  See Note 3 in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for information on the Company’s discontinued operations.  DEA Matter  In a series of actions taken during November and December 2007, the DEA suspended the licenses to distribute controlled substances held by three of the Company’s distribution centers. The Company is evaluating its controls against diversion of controlled substances on a company-wide basis, has taken actions to strengthen these controls, is developing a plan to enhance the controls and is engaged in discussions with the DEA relating to the concerns underlying the DEA’s actions. The Company expects that it will incur significant expenses related to this matter in fiscal 2008 and has lost customers, and may lose additional customers, related to this matter. Such expenses and related lost revenue will have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations during fiscal 2008. The Company discusses this matter in greater detail in Note 7 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.”  Segment Results of Operations  Reportable Segments   The Company’s operations are organized into four reportable segments: Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical; Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Medical; Clinical Technologies and Services; and Medical Products and Technologies. The Company evaluates the performance of the individual segments based upon, among other things, segment profit. Segment profit is segment revenue less segment cost of products sold, less segment SG&A expenses. Segment SG&A expense includes equity compensation expense as well as allocated corporate expenses for shared functions, including corporate management, corporate finance, financial shared services, human resources, information technology, legal and legislative affairs and an integrated hospital sales organization. Corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based upon headcount, level of benefit provided and ratable allocation depending on the nature of the expense. Information about interest income and expense and income taxes is not provided at the     35    Table of Contents  segment level. In addition, special items, impairment charges and other, and costs associated with certain strategic investments that require the approval of executive management are not allocated to the segments. See Note 11 in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on the Company’s reportable segments.  Revenue increased in each of the Company’s four reportable segments during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to prior year. Segment profit increased for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 in the Clinical Technologies and Services (26% and 49%, respectively) and Medical Products and Technologies (46% and 35%, respectively) segments. Segment profit decreased for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 in the Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical (21% and 9%, respectively) and Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Medical segments (13% and 12%, respectively).  The following table summarizes segment revenue for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2007 and 2006:                                  Three Months EndedDecember 31,     Six Months EndedDecember 31,     (in millions, except growth rates)   Growth (1)     2007     2006     Growth (1)     2007     2006     Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical:                               Revenue from non-bulk customers(2)   1 %   $ 10,658.0     $ 10,564.4     —  %   $ 20,936.5     $ 21,038.2     Revenue from bulk customers(2)   12 %     9,692.8       8,673.2     11 %     18,635.1       16,732.2                                               Total Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical   6 %   $ 20,350.8     $ 19,237.6     5 %   $ 39,571.6     $ 37,770.4     Healthcare Supply Chain Services—Medical   8 %     2,014.9       1,872.5     7 %     3,935.6       3,678.5     Clinical Technologies and Services   8 %     714.5       662.4     8 %     1,363.5       1,256.9     Medical Products and Technologies   47 %     666.8       455.0     47 %     1.290.0       878.6                                               Total segment revenue   7 %     23,747.0       22,227.5     6 %     46,160.7       43,584.4     Corporate(3)   N.M.

(2) Bulk customers consist of customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses. Non-bulk customers include retail stores, pharmacies, hospitals, alternate care sites and other customers not specifically classified as bulk customers. Most deliveries to bulk customers consist of product shipped in the same form as received from the manufacturer. See discussion below within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical section for a more detailed description of revenue from bulk customers.    (3) Corporate revenue consists of the elimination of inter-segment revenue for all periods presented.

(2) For the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, Corporate includes special items, impairment charges and other, and certain other Corporate investment spending that require the approval of executive management as described below:        •    Special items — Corporate includes special items of $30 million and $52 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, respectively, compared to $20 million and $42 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, respectively (see Note 2 in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of special items).        •    Impairment charges and other —Asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as special items or discontinued operations are retained at Corporate. Impairment charges and other were $(23) million for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to $13 million and $14 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, respectively (see Note 2 in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of impairment charges and other).        •    Investment spending — The Company has encouraged its business units to identify investment projects which will provide future returns. These projects typically require incremental strategic investments in the form of additional capital or operating expenses. As approval decisions for such projects are dependent upon Corporate executive management, the expenses for such projects are retained at Corporate. Investment spending for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 was $6 million and $11 million, respectively, compared to $3 million and $5 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, respectively.  Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical Performance  During the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical experienced revenue growth and segment profit decline compared to the prior year. Revenue growth was primarily a result of additional volume from existing bulk customers and pharmaceutical price appreciation. The decline in segment profit was primarily a result of the repricing of several large customer contracts in the second half of fiscal 2007 and the first half of fiscal 2008 and unfavorable sales mix, generic deflation and a decrease in the impact of generic launches. In addition, during the three months ended December 31, 2007, Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical received less benefit from manufacturer price appreciation; however, during the six months ended December 31, 2007, it received more benefit from manufacturer price appreciation compared to the prior year. The various factors listed above, plus the costs and lost revenue associated with the above-described DEA matter, are expected to adversely impact segment profit during the remainder of fiscal 2008.  Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical revenue growth of $1.1 billion or 6% and $1.8 billion or 5%, respectively, during the three and six month period ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to additional volume from existing bulk customers and pharmaceutical price appreciation (combined impact of volume and pharmaceutical price appreciation was $1.3 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively). The pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 6.7% for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2007. Revenue was also positively impacted by new customers ($113 million and $197 million, respectively). Negatively impacting growth in revenue was the loss of customers ($291 million and $709 million, respectively) in the current year periods compared to the prior year periods.  Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical segment profit decreased $70 million or 21% and $53 million or 9%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in segment profit was caused by a $69 million and $56 million decrease in gross margin during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, respectively. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to increased customer discounts ($89 million and $159 million, respectively) as a result of increased sales volume, the repricing of several large customer contracts in the second half of fiscal 2007 and the first half of fiscal 2008 and growth of approximately 12% and 11%, respectively, in sales to bulk customers which tend to have larger customer discounts. The Company expects a certain level of continued customer discounting due to the competitive market in which it operates. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by decreased generic margin ($31 million and $44 million, respectively) primarily due to generic deflation and the impact of generic launches in the prior year which did not occur in the current year partially offset by increased unit sales growth. The Company generally earns the highest margins on generic pharmaceuticals during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product to the marketplace because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally deflationary. Distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation were approximately $12 million lower year over year for the three months ended December 31, 2007 resulting in a negative impact on gross margin due to less benefit received from manufacturer price appreciation during the current period compared to the prior year period. Distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation were $56 million higher year over year for the six months ended December 31, 2007 resulting in a favorable impact on gross margin     37    Table of Contents  due to increased sales volume and benefit from manufacturer price appreciation. Gross margin was positively impacted during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 by increased manufacturer cash discounts due to increased sales volume ($42 million and $53 million, respectively).  SG&A expenses remained relatively flat for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior year period and was positively impacted by a change in the allocation of corporate costs as well as spending controls. During fiscal 2008, a change in the methodology for allocating corporate costs for the Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Medical segments to better align corporate spending with the segment that receives the related benefits resulted in decreased expense ($6 million and $11 million, respectively) allocated to Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical.  The Company’s results could be adversely affected if sales of pharmaceutical products decline, the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches decreases, or generic price deflation exceeds or pharmaceutical price appreciation on branded products decreases from their historical rates. Alternatively, the Company’s results could benefit if sales of pharmaceutical products increase, the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches increases, or generic price deflation decreases from or pharmaceutical price appreciation on branded products exceeds their historical rates.  Bulk and Non-Bulk Customers. The Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical segment differentiates between bulk and non-bulk customers because bulk customers generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than non-bulk customers. Bulk customers consist of customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses. All other customers are classified as non-bulk customers (for example, retail stores, pharmacies, hospitals and alternate care sites). Bulk customers include the warehouse operations of retail chains whose retail stores are classified as non-bulk customers. For example, a single retail chain pharmacy customer may be both a bulk customer with respect to its warehouse operations and a non-bulk customer with respect to its retail stores. Bulk customers have the ability to process large quantities of products in central locations and self-distribute these products to their individual retail stores or customers. Substantially all deliveries to bulk customers consist of product shipped in the same form as the product is received from the manufacturer, but a small portion of deliveries to bulk customers are broken down into smaller units prior to shipping. Non-bulk customers, on the other hand, require more complex servicing by the Company. These services, all of which are performed by the Company, include receiving inventory in large or full case quantities and breaking it down into smaller quantities, warehousing the product for a longer period of time, picking individual products specific to a customer’s order and delivering that smaller order to a customer location.  The Company tracks revenue by bulk and non-bulk customers in its financial systems. To assist the Company in managing its business, an internal analysis has been prepared to allocate segment expenses (total of segment cost of products sold and segment SG&A expenses) separately for bulk and non-bulk customers. The following table shows the allocation of segment expenses, segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and non-bulk customers for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006:    38    Table of Contents                         Three Months EndedDecember 31,     Six Months EndedDecember 31,     (in millions, except percentage of revenue)   2007     2006     2007     2006     Non-bulk customers:                       Revenue from non-bulk customers   $ 10,658     $ 10,564     $ 20,937     $ 21,038     Segment expenses allocated to non-bulk customers(1)   $ 10,432     $ 10,285     $ 20,460     $ 20,493     Segment profit from non-bulk customers(1)   $ 226     $ 279     $ 477     $ 545     Segment profit from non-bulk customers as a percentage of revenue from non-bulk customers(1)     2.1 %     2.6 %     2.3 %     2.6 %   Bulk customers:                       Revenue from bulk customers   $ 9,693     $ 8,673     $ 18,635     $ 16,732     Segment expenses allocated to bulk customers(1)   $ 9,661     $ 8,624     $ 18,549     $ 16,660     Segment profit from bulk customers(1)   $ 32     $ 49     $ 86     $ 72     Segment profit from bulk customers as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers(1)     0.3 %     0.6 %     0.5 %     0.4 %      (1) Amounts shown are estimates based upon the internal analysis described above. The preparation of this internal analysis required the use of complex and subjective estimates and allocations based upon assumptions, past experience and judgment that the Company believes are reasonable. The core pharmaceutical distribution operation (“Distribution”) within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical segment services both bulk and non-bulk customers. Therefore, expenses associated with this operation were allocated between bulk and non-bulk customers as described below. The brokerage operation (“Brokerage”) within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical segment only services bulk customers, therefore, expenses associated with Brokerage are allocated to bulk customers. The remaining operations (i.e., excluding Distribution) within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical segment service non-bulk customers, therefore, expenses associated with these operations were allocated to non-bulk customers.  The following describes the allocation of the major components of cost of products sold for Distribution between bulk and non-bulk customers:        •    Cost of products sold for pharmaceutical products is determined by specifically tracking the manufacturer’s designated price of products, at the time the products are sold, by bulk and non-bulk customers. The manufacturer’s designated price is then reduced by other components impacting cost of products sold, including distribution service agreement fees, pharmaceutical price appreciation, manufacturer cash discounts and manufacturer rebates and incentives. In addition, other inventory charges and credits are added or subtracted, as appropriate, to arrive at cost of products sold. The Company used the following methods that it believes provide a reasonable correlation to allocate the remaining components of cost of products sold between bulk and non-bulk customers:        •    Distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation are tracked by manufacturer. Therefore, the Company allocated the distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation associated with each manufacturer among their products in proportion to sales of each product between bulk and non-bulk customers.        •    Manufacturer cash discounts are recognized as a reduction to cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold and were allocated in proportion to the manufacturer’s published price of the product sold to bulk and non-bulk customers.        •    Manufacturers’ rebates and incentives are based on the individual agreements entered into with manufacturers related to specific products. Rebates and incentives were grouped by contract terms and then allocated in proportion to sales to bulk and non-bulk customers.        •    Other inventory charges and credits include charges for outdated and returned inventory items and fluctuation in inventory reserves. The Company estimated the portion of these inventory charges and credits attributable to each product and then allocated them to bulk and non-bulk customers in proportion to the sales of these products.    39    Table of Contents The Company used methods that it believes provide a reasonable correlation to allocate the SG&A expenses for Distribution between bulk and non-bulk customers as follows:        •    Warehouse expense includes labor-related expenses associated with receiving, shipping and handling the inventory as well as warehouse storage costs including insurance, taxes, supplies and other facility costs. Warehouse expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoice line items filled for each bulk or non-bulk customer because the Company believes that there is a correlation between the number of different products ordered as reflected in invoice lines and the level of effort associated with receiving, shipping and handling that order (bulk customers typically order substantially larger quantities of products and therefore generate substantially fewer invoice lines which results in substantially less warehouse expense being allocated to bulk customers);        •    Delivery expense includes transportation costs associated with physically moving the product from the warehouse to the customer’s designated location. Delivery expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoices generated for each bulk or non-bulk customer on the assumption that each invoice generates a delivery;        •    Sales expense includes personnel-related costs associated with sales and customer service activities (such activities are the same for both bulk and non-bulk customers). Sales expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoices generated for each bulk or non-bulk customer because customer invoices are a reasonable estimate of the amount of customer service calls and sales effort; and        •    General and administrative expenses were allocated in proportion to the units of products sold to bulk or non-bulk customers. These expenses were allocated on the assumption that general and administrative expenses increase or decrease in direct relation to the volume of sales.  The internal analysis indicated segment expenses as a percentage of revenue were higher for bulk customers than for non-bulk customers because of higher segment cost of products sold partially offset by lower segment SG&A expenses. Bulk customers receive lower pricing on sales of the same products than non-bulk customers due to volume pricing in a competitive market and the lower costs related to the services provided by the Company. In addition, sales to bulk customers in aggregate generate higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than sales to non-bulk customers because bulk customers’ orders consist almost entirely of higher cost branded products. The higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is also driven by lower manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and branded pharmaceutical price appreciation and lower manufacturer cash discounts. Manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and manufacturer cash discounts are recognized as a reduction to segment cost of products sold and are lower as a percentage of revenue due to the mix of products sold. Pharmaceutical price appreciation increases customer pricing which, in turn, results in higher segment gross margin for sales of inventory that was on-hand at the time of the manufacturer’s price increase. Since products sold to bulk customers are generally held in inventory for a shorter time than products sold to non-bulk customers, there is less opportunity to realize the benefit of pharmaceutical price appreciation. Consequently, segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is higher than for non-bulk customers and segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue is substantially lower for bulk customers than for non-bulk customers. Deliveries to bulk customers require substantially less services by the Company than deliveries to non-bulk customers. As such, the segment SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers are substantially lower than from non-bulk customers. These factors result in segment profit as a percentage of revenue being significantly lower for bulk customers than for non-bulk customers.  The Company defines bulk customers based on the way in which the Company operates its business and the services it performs for its customers. The Company is not aware of an industry standard regarding the definition of bulk customers and based solely on a review of the Annual Reports on Form 10-K of other national pharmaceutical wholesalers, the Company notes that other companies in comparable businesses may, or may not, use a different definition of bulk customers.  During the three months ended December 31, 2007 revenue from non-bulk customers increased $94 million compared to the same period in the prior year due to additional volume from existing customers partially offset by the loss of customers. During the six months ended December 31, 2007 revenue from non-bulk customers decreased $101 million compared to the same period in the prior year due to the loss of     40    Table of Contents  customers partially offset by additional volume from existing customers. Segment profit from non-bulk customers decreased $53 million and $68 million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year. This decrease in segment profit from non-bulk customers was due primarily to the sales volume coupled with an increase in customer discounts.  During the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 revenue from bulk customers increased $1.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year due to new contracts signed with existing customers which resulted in increased volume from existing customers. Segment profit from bulk customers decreased $17 million during the three months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increased customer discounts partially offset by increased manufacturer cash discounts related to sales volume growth. Segment profit from bulk customers increased $14 million during the six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the increase in distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased manufacturer cash discounts related to sales volume growth partially offset by additional customer discounts.  Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Medical Performance  Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Medical segment revenue growth of $142 million or 8% and $257 million or 7%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior year period resulted primarily from increased volume from existing hospital, laboratory, and ambulatory care customers ($160 million and $286 million, respectively), new customer accounts ($30 million and $41 million, respectively) and the impact of foreign exchange ($18 million and $26 million, respectively). Revenue was negatively impacted by the loss of customers ($63 million and $93 million, respectively).  Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Medical segment profit decreased $10 million or 13% and $17 million or 12%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior year period. Gross margin increased segment profit by $6 million and $8 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of revenue growth. Increases in SG&A expenses decreased segment profit by $16 million and $25 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 partially as a result of changing the methodology for allocating corporate costs for the Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Medical segments to better align corporate spending with the segment that receives the related benefits. The change in methodology resulted in increased expense ($6 million and $11 million, respectively) allocated to the Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Medical segment.  Clinical Technologies and Services Performance  Clinical Technologies and Services segment revenue grew $52 million or 8% and $107 million or 8%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth was favorably impacted by new products ($26 million and $46 million, respectively), new customers ($16 million and $26 million, respectively) and the impact of foreign exchange ($8 million and $12 million, respectively).  Clinical Technologies and Services segment profit increased $24 million or 26% and $70 million or 49%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior year period. Gross margin increased segment profit by $28 million and $79 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of revenue growth and a favorable mix of higher margin products. The year over year impact of charges for product recalls and reserves for the Alaris Pump module and Alaris SE pump negatively impacted gross margin for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 by $10 million and $1 million, respectively. Increases in SG&A expenses decreased segment profit by $5 million and $8 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007.  Medical Products and Technologies Performance  Medical Products and Technologies segment revenue grew $212 million or 47% and $411 million or 47%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth for the segment was favorably impacted by the Viasys acquisition ($173 million     41    Table of Contents  and $341 million, respectively), international revenue growth ($26 million and $42 million, respectively), which includes the impact of foreign exchange ($16 million and $24 million, respectively), and new product launches ($10 million and $20 million, respectively).  Medical Products and Technologies segment profit increased $22 million or 46% and $33 million or 35%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior year period. Gross margin increased segment profit by $90 million and $167 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of revenue growth, the Viasys acquisition ($80 million and $151 million, respectively) and the impact of foreign exchange ($9 million and $10 million, respectively). Increases in SG&A expenses negatively impacted segment profit by $68 million and $135 million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, respectively, primarily from the impact of the Viasys acquisition ($61 million and $120 million, respectively).  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Sources and Uses of Cash  The following table summarizes the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006:                    Six Months EndedDecember 31,     (in millions)   2007     2006     Net cash provided by/(used in) – continuing operations:             Operating activities   $ 415.1     $ 618.2     Investing activities   $ (72.0 )   $ (230.5 )   Financing activities   $ (435.0 )   $ (560.0 )   Net cash provided by/(used in) – discontinued operations:             Operating activities   $ (32.5 )   $ 21.6     Investing activities   $ —      $ (7.9 )   Financing activities   $ —      $ (24.0 )  Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during the six months ended December 31, 2007 totaled $415 million, a decrease of $203 million when compared to the six months ended December 31, 2006. The decrease is primarily due to an overall increase in the Company’s working capital driven by an increase in inventories ($254 million) and a decrease in accounts payable ($180 million). The working capital increase is primarily due to the timing of cash disbursements and inventory purchases during the current year period compared to the prior year.  Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities for continuing operations of $72 million during the six months ended December 31, 2007 reflected capital spending ($172 million) partially offset by the net proceeds from the sale of short-term investments classified as available for sale ($132 million). In addition, the Company utilized cash to complete the Viasys acquisition within the Medical Products and Technologies segment slightly offset by cash received for the divestiture of an investment within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services – Pharmaceutical segment (combined impact $39 million).  Net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2006 of $231 million reflected the Company’s capital spending ($154 million) and cash to complete acquisitions ($121 million) within the Clinical Technologies and Services segment. These uses of cash were partially offset by the net proceeds from the sale of certain short-term investments classified as available for sale ($31 million).  Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities for continuing operations of $435 million during the six months ended December 31, 2007 reflected the Company’s repurchase of its Common Shares ($1.0 billion) and dividend payments to shareholders ($88 million). See “Share Repurchase Program” below for additional information. Cash provided by financing activities included the net change in commercial paper and short-term borrowings ($519 million) and proceeds received from shares issued under various employee stock plans ($164 million). See “Capital Resources” below for further discussion of the Company’s financing activities.    42    Table of Contents Net cash used in financing activities for continuing operations of $560 million during the six months ended December 31, 2006 reflected the Company’s repurchase of its Common Shares ($745 million). In addition, the Company utilized cash to repay long-term obligations ($689 million) and pay dividend payments to shareholders ($73 million). Cash provided by financing activities included proceeds received from long-term obligations ($852 million) and proceeds received from shares issued under various employee stock plans ($75 million).  International Cash  The Company’s cash balance of approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2007 includes $798 million of cash held by its subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject it to U.S. federal income tax.  Share Repurchase Program  During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased approximately $342 million of its Common Shares under a $4.5 billion combined repurchase authorization which will expire on June 30, 2008. At December 30, 2007, approximately $406 million remained from the $4.5 billion repurchase authorization.  During the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, the Company repurchased approximately $350 million and $600 million, respectively, of its Common Shares under an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase program announced on August 8, 2007. This repurchase authorization will expire on August 31, 2009.  See the table under “Part II, Item 2” for more information regarding these repurchases.  Capital Resources  In addition to cash, the Company’s sources of liquidity include a $1.5 billion commercial paper program backed by a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a committed receivables sales facility program with the capacity to sell $850 million in receivables. The Company amended the receivables sales facility program during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 which resulted in increasing the program from $800 million to $850 million and extending it for an additional 364 days. The Company had $520 million outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program at December 31, 2007.  The Company also maintains other short-term credit facilities and an unsecured line of credit that allows for borrowings up to $45 million, of which $14 million was outstanding at December 31, 2007.  The Company’s capital resources are more fully described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 5, 10 and 19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2007 Form 10-K.  From time to time, the Company considers and engages in acquisition transactions in order to expand its role as a leading provider of products and services that improve the safety and productivity of healthcare. The Company evaluates possible candidates for acquisition and considers opportunities to expand its role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry through all its reportable segments. If additional transactions are entered into or consummated, the Company may need to enter into funding arrangements for such acquisitions.  The Company currently believes that, based upon existing cash, operating cash flows, available capital resources (as discussed above) and other available market transactions, it has adequate capital resources at its disposal to fund currently anticipated capital expenditures, business growth and expansion, contractual obligations and current and projected debt service requirements, including those related to business combinations.    43    Table of Contents During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company retired 128 million Common Shares in treasury.  Debt Covenants  The Company’s various borrowing facilities and long-term debt are free of any financial covenants other than minimum net worth which cannot fall below $5.0 billion at any time. As of December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with this covenant.  Contractual Obligations  There have been no material changes, outside of the ordinary course of business, in the Company’s outstanding contractual obligations from those disclosed within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2007 Form 10-K other than changes resulting from the adoption of FIN No. 48. As further discussed in Note 6 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” within this Form 10-Q, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48 effective July 1, 2007. Among other things, as a result of the adoption of FIN No. 48, the Company reclassified unrecognized tax benefits to long-term income taxes payable. The Company had $641.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2007 which were not included in the “Contractual Obligations” table of the 2007 Form 10-K. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to allocate these amounts to any particular years in the table.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capital Resources” above and Note 19 in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2007 Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements.  Recent Financial Accounting Standards  See Note 1 in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards.       Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  The Company believes that there has been no material change in the quantitative and qualitative market risks from those discussed in the 2007 Form 10-K.       Item 4: Controls and Procedures  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company carried out an evaluation, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2007. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2007 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and to provide that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, the Company began processing selected financial transactions for its corporate functions and the Clinical Technologies and Services segment on a newly implemented accounting software system. The Company will transition selected financial processes within its other segments to the new accounting software system later in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. This change of systems is designed to streamline and integrate the Company’s financial close and reporting processes by reducing the number of platforms used to record and report financial information, improving efficiency by reducing the amount of manual activity, and improving the control environment by reducing variability in the financial policies, processes and systems. The Company has made changes to its internal control over financial reporting in connection with this transition to the new accounting software system. During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, the     44    Table of Contents  Company established additional temporary compensating controls that are expected to support the Company’s internal control over financial reporting while the transition to the new accounting software system is in process. The Company expects to maintain certain of these additional temporary compensating controls until implementation of the new system is complete. There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.  Limitations on Control Systems. The Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, does not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. The Company monitors its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls on an ongoing basis and makes modifications as necessary; the Company’s intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and the internal controls will be maintained as dynamic systems that change (including with improvements and corrections) as conditions warrant.    45    Table of Contents  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION       Item 1: Legal Proceedings  The legal proceedings described in Note 7 of “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” are incorporated in this Part II, Item 1 by reference.  SEC Investigation  As previously disclosed, on July 26, 2007, the Company announced a settlement with the SEC that concludes, with respect to the Company, an SEC investigation relating principally to the Company’s financial reporting and disclosures. For further information regarding this investigation, see the 2007 Form 10-K. The resolution of this matter required, among other things, the Company to retain an independent consultant to review certain company policies and procedures. The Company did so, and in November 2007, the independent consultant submitted a report to the Company and the SEC staff. The Company has implemented the independent consultant’s final recommendations.  The Company’s settlement with the SEC does not resolve the investigation by the SEC of certain individuals. As stated in the 2007 Form 10-K, in January 2007 the Company learned that its then-Executive Chairman of the Board (who is now an Executive Director), as well as four former officers and employees, received Wells notices from the staff of the SEC. The outcome of the continuing SEC investigation relating to individuals and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include the institution of administrative or civil injunctive proceedings involving current or former Company employees, officers and/or directors, as well as the imposition of fines and other penalties, remedies and sanctions upon such persons.       Item 1A: Risk Factors  In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in the Company’s 2007 Form 10-K, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and/or future business prospects, and the developments disclosed in the Company’s filings with the SEC since the date of the 2007 Form 10-K that relate to the risks described in the 2007 Form 10-K. The risks described in the 2007 Form 10-K are not the only risks that the Company faces. The Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and/or future business prospects could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not known to it at the time of this filing on Form 10-Q or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial.
