Item 1A: Risk Factors" of our 2012 Form 10-K. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.OverviewWe are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies, hospitals, surgery centers, physician offices and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs, enhancing efficiency and improving quality. We report our financial results in two segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical.Revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2012 was $25.2 billion and $51.1 billion, a 7 percent and 5 percent decrease, respectively, from the prior-year periods, largely due to the previously disclosed expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Express Scripts, Inc. and the impact of brand-to-generic pharmaceutical conversions. Gross margin increased 10 percent to $1.2 billion and 8 percent to $2.4 billion for the three and six months ended December 31, 2012, respectively, reflecting strong performance in our Pharmaceutical segment generic programs. Operating earnings increased 13 percent to $506 million and 12 percent to $963 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2012, respectively. Also contributing to the increase in operating earnings for the three and six months ended December 31, 2012 was $12 million and $34 million of income, respectively, from settlements of class action antitrust claims. Earnings from continuing operations were up 15 percent to $303 million and $575 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2012, respectively, due to the factors discussed above.Our cash and equivalents balance was $2.3 billion at both December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012. For the six months ended December 31, 2012, our cash and equivalents balance was impacted by net cash provided by operating activities of $438 million, share repurchases of $200 million, cash dividends of $165 million and acquisitions of $126 million.  Restructuring On January 30, 2013, we announced a restructuring plan within our Medical segment. Under this restructuring plan, we expect to, among other things, move production of procedure kits from our facility in Waukegan, Illinois to other facilities and sell property and consolidate office space in Waukegan, Illinois. In addition, we are reorganizing our Medical segment organization and plan to sell our sterilization processes in El Paso, Texas. At this time, we estimate the total costs associated with this restructuring plan to be approximately $79 million on a pre-tax basis, of which approximately $55 million will be recognized in the second half of fiscal 2013. These costs will be recorded as restructuring and employee severance and impairments and loss on disposal of assets in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. We expect this restructuring plan to be completed by the end of fiscal 2014 and expect to start realizing cost savings and other benefits from the plan beginning in fiscal 2014. See our Form 8-K filed on January 30, 2013 for additional information.TrendsIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively the “Healthcare Reform Acts”) were enacted. The Healthcare Reform Acts impose a 2.3 percent excise tax based on the sales price of certain manufactured or imported medical devices, effective January 1, 2013. In December 2012, the Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations and interim guidance implementing this tax. We manufacture and sell devices that became subject to this tax beginning January 1, 2013.In the ordinary course of our business, we are frequently in a request for proposal process for pharmaceutical distribution and other business of a customer or potential customer. CVS Caremark Corporation ("CVS") and Walgreen Co. ("Walgreens") accounted for approximately 22 percent and 21 percent, respectively, of our fiscal 2012 revenue. Our contracts with CVS and Walgreens are currently scheduled to expire in June 2013 and August 2013, respectively. Walgreens and CVS issued requests for proposal for pharmaceutical distribution services during August 2012 and December 2012, respectively, and we are participating in these processes. Spin-Off of CareFusionEffective August 31, 2009, we separated our clinical and medical products businesses through a distribution to our shareholders of 81 percent of the then outstanding common stock of CareFusion Corporation ("CareFusion") and retained the remaining shares of CareFusion common stock (the "Spin-Off"). During fiscal 2010 and 2011, we disposed of the remaining shares of CareFusion common stock. We are a party to a separation agreement and various other agreements relating to the separation, including a tax matters agreement. Under the tax matters agreement, CareFusion is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to the Spin-Off. The indemnification receivable was $270 million and $265 million at December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, respectively, and is included in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.13Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)Results of OperationsRevenue Three Months Ended December 31,  (in millions)2012 2011 ChangePharmaceutical$22,747 $24,665 (8)%Medical2,487 2,416 3 %Total segment revenue25,234 27,081 (7)%Corporate(2) (3) N.M.Total revenue$25,232 $27,078 (7)% Six Months Ended December 31,  (in millions)2012 2011 ChangePharmaceutical$46,244 $49,083 (6)%Medical4,879 4,796 2 %Total segment revenue51,123 53,879 (5)%Corporate(2) (9) N.M.Total revenue$51,121 $53,870 (5)%Pharmaceutical SegmentRevenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2012 compared to the prior-year periods was negatively impacted by the expiration on September 30, 2012 of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Express Scripts, Inc. (approximately $2.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively), the revenue from which was classified as bulk sales. Primarily as a result of brand-to-generic pharmaceutical conversions, revenue from existing pharmaceutical distribution customers decreased by approximately $765 million and $2.3 billion, respectively. Brand-to-generic pharmaceutical conversions impact our revenue because generic pharmaceuticals generally sell at a lower price than the corresponding brand product and because some of our customers primarily source generic products directly from manufacturers rather than purchasing from us. The decrease was partially offset by increased pharmaceutical distribution revenue from new customers (approximately $1.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively) and revenue growth within our specialty solutions division ($260 million and $512 million, respectively). Non-bulk sales for the six months ended December 31, 2012 compared to the prior-year period increased by 7 percent driven by growth from new customers. Bulk sales for the six months ended December 31, 2012 decreased by 23 percent driven primarily by the loss of our contract with Express Scripts, Inc. and brand-to-generic conversions.Medical SegmentRevenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2012 compared to the prior-year periods reflects the benefit of acquisitions ($55 million and $103 million, respectively). The increase in the three months ended December 31, 2012 was also a result of one additional sales day in the period ($29 million). The revenue increase was partially offset by lower volumes from existing customers ($30 million and $51 million, respectively) driven in part by lower procedural volume.Cost of Products SoldConsistent with the decrease in revenue, cost of products sold during the three and six months ended December 31, 2012 decreased $2.0 billion (8 percent) and $2.9 billion (6 percent), respectively, compared to the prior-year periods. See the gross margin discussion below for additional drivers impacting cost of products sold. Gross Margin Three Months Ended December 31,  (in millions)2012 2011 ChangeGross margin$1,224 $1,114 10% Six Months Ended December 31,  (in millions)2012 2011 ChangeGross margin$2,382 $2,198 8%Pharmaceutical SegmentGross margin increased $78 million and $132 million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2012, respectively, compared to the prior-year periods driven by strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs (approximately $109 million and $203 million, respectively) and the benefits of customer and product mix within our pharmaceutical distribution division. Pharmaceutical distribution customer pricing changes, including rebates (exclusive of the related volume impact), adversely impacted gross margin by an estimated $34 million and $74 million, respectively. The adverse impact of these customer pricing changes for any particular customer is often partially offset by product mix, sourcing programs and other sources of margin. As described above, brand-to-generic conversions and the expiration of the Express Scripts, Inc. contract resulted in lower revenue; however, these items did not have a significant impact on gross margin. As a result of significant market softness, gross margin from our nuclear pharmacy services division decreased by $21 million and $42 million, respectively.Medical SegmentGross margin increased $30 million and $50 million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2012, respectively, compared to the prior-year periods. Decreases in the cost of oil-based resins, cotton, latex and other commodities used in our self-manufactured products increased gross margin by $13 million and $16 million, respectively. Acquisitions positively impacted gross margin by $12 million and $23 million, respectively. Favorable product mix positively impacted gross margin by $6 million and $13 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2011, costs associated with the Presource® procedure kit import matter decreased gross margin by $3 million and $13 million, respectively. These items were partially offset by the adverse impact of customer pricing changes ($12 million and $21 million, respectively), lower volume from existing customers and customer mix.SG&A Expenses Three Months Ended December 31,  (in millions)2012 2011 ChangeSG&A expenses$699 $640 9% Six Months Ended December 31,  (in millions)2012 2011 ChangeSG&A expenses$1,388 $1,283 8%SG&A expenses increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2012 due to acquisitions ($12 million and $23 million, respectively), investment spending and other strategic priorities ($12 million during each period) and business system investments, including depreciation and other costs associated with the Medical segment business transformation project ($11 million and $23 million, respectively).  14Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)Segment Profit and Consolidated Operating Earnings Three Months Ended December 31,  (in millions)2012 2011 ChangePharmaceutical$441 $394 12%Medical94 85 11%Total segment profit535 479 12%Corporate(29) (30) N.M.Total operating earnings$506 $449 13% Six Months Ended December 31,  (in millions)2012 2011 ChangePharmaceutical$841 $757 11%Medical168 164 3%Total segment profit1,009 921 10%Corporate(46) (59) N.M.Total operating earnings$963 $862 12%Pharmaceutical Segment ProfitThe principal drivers for the increase during the three and six months ended December 31, 2012 were strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs and the benefits of customer and product mix, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of pharmaceutical distribution customer pricing changes and significant market softness in our nuclear pharmacy services division. See the discussion of gross margin above for further information on these drivers.Medical Segment ProfitThe increase during the three and six months ended December 31, 2012 resulted from the decreased cost of commodities used in our self-manufactured products, the positive impact of acquisitions, favorable product mix, and the prior-year costs associated with the Presource® procedure kit import matter, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of customer pricing changes, lower volume from existing customers and customer mix. See the discussion of gross margin above for further information on these drivers. The net impact of our medical business transformation was negative by $3 million and $13 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2012 when considering all related factors, including year-over-year incremental depreciation and program expenses, realized benefits and approximately $5 million and $8 million favorable out-of-period adjustments for the three and six months ended December 31, 2012, respectively, to reflect certain vendor chargeback billings that were delayed when we implemented our medical business transformation. The $5 million out-of-period adjustment recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2012 included $2 million related to the three months ended September 30, 2012 and the remainder related to fiscal 2012. Consolidated Operating EarningsIn addition to revenue, gross margin and SG&A expenses discussed above, operating earnings were impacted by the following: Three Months Ended December 31,(in millions)2012 2011Restructuring and employee severance$1 $2Acquisition-related costs25 22Impairments and loss on disposal of assets5 1Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net(12) —  Six Months Ended December 31,(in millions)2012 2011Restructuring and employee severance$6 $5Acquisition-related costs53 49Impairments and loss on disposal of assets6 2Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net(34) (3)Acquisition-Related CostsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $22 million and $43 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2012, respectively, and $19 million and $38 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2011, respectively.Litigation (Recoveries)/Charges, NetDuring the three and six months ended December 31, 2012, we recognized $12 million and $34 million, respectively, of income resulting from settlements of class action antitrust claims in which we were a class member.Earnings Before Income Taxes and Discontinued OperationsIn addition to the items discussed above, earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following: Three Months Ended December 31,  (in millions)2012 2011 ChangeOther (income)/expense, net$(4) $— N.M.Interest expense, net27 23 18% Six Months Ended December 31,  (in millions)2012 2011 ChangeOther (income)/expense, net$(12) $5 N.M.Interest expense, net53 46 14%Provision for Income TaxesThe following tables summarize our provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax earnings ("effective tax rate"): Three Months Ended December 31, 2012 2011Effective tax rate37.2% 37.9% Six Months Ended December 31, 2012 2011Effective tax rate37.6% 38.1%During the three and six months ended December 31, 2012, the effective tax rate was impacted by net unfavorable discrete items of $2 million and $6 million, or 0.3 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. The discrete items include unfavorable amounts related to the establishment of a valuation allowance and changes in unrecognized tax benefits.During the three and six months ended December 31, 2011, the effective tax rate was impacted by net unfavorable discrete items of $5 million and $8 million, or 1.1 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively. The discrete items include unfavorable amounts related to remeasuring certain unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the favorable impact of settling certain state tax matters.15Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)Ongoing AuditsThe IRS is currently conducting audits of fiscal years 2003 through 2010. We have received proposed adjustments from the IRS for fiscal years 2003 through 2007 related to our transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among subsidiaries of an acquired entity prior to its acquisition by us. The IRS has proposed additional taxes of $849 million, excluding penalties and interest. If this tax ultimately must be paid, CareFusion is liable under the tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the Spin-Off for $592 million of the total amount. We disagree with these proposed adjustments, which we are contesting, and have accounted for the unrecognized tax benefits related to them.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe currently believe that, based upon available capital resources (cash on hand), projected operating cash flow and access to committed credit facilities, we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs; currently anticipated capital expenditures, business growth and expansion; contractual obligations; payments for tax settlements; and current and projected debt service requirements, dividends and share repurchases.Cash and EquivalentsOur cash and equivalents balance was $2.3 billion at both December 31, 2012, and June 30, 2012. At December 31, 2012, our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments. For the six months ended December 31, 2012, our cash and equivalents balance was impacted by net cash provided by operating activities of $438 million, share repurchases of $200 million, cash dividends of $165 million and acquisitions of $126 million. We use days sales outstanding (“DSO”), days inventory on hand (“DIOH”) and days payable outstanding (“DPO”) to evaluate our working capital performance. DSO is calculated as trade receivables, net divided by (quarterly revenue divided by 90 days). DIOH is calculated as inventories divided by ((quarterly cost of products sold plus chargeback billings) divided by 90 days). DPO is calculated as accounts payable divided by ((quarterly cost of products sold plus chargeback billings) divided by 90 days). Chargeback billings are the difference between a product’s wholesale acquisition cost and the contract price established between the vendors and the end customer. Chargeback billings were $4.1 billion and $3.6 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we changed our method of calculating DSO in order to align it with the 90-day convention that we use in the calculation of DIOH and DPO. Prior to this change, we calculated DSO by dividing trade receivables, net by (monthly revenue divided by 30 days). In connection with this change, we have revised prior-year information to conform to the new method of calculating DSO. December 31, 2012 2011Days sales outstanding22.0 19.9Days inventory on hand27.0 27.0Days payable outstanding37.8 37.9Changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of inventory purchases, customer payments of accounts receivable and payments to vendors in the regular course of business. DSO increased as a result of the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Express Scripts, Inc. and growth in China and our specialty solutions division.The expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Express Scripts, Inc. did not have a significant impact on DIOH and DPO.The cash and equivalents balance at December 31, 2012 included $357 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation, permanently bringing the money into the United States could trigger U.S. federal, state and local income tax obligations. As a U.S. parent company, we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to U.S. federal income tax through intercompany loans.Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperOur sources of liquidity include a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a $950 million committed receivables sales facility program. At times, availability under our committed receivables sales facility program may be less than $950 million based on receivables concentration limits and our outstanding eligible receivables balance. We also have a commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion, backed by the revolving credit facility.We had no outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program and no outstanding balance under the committed receivables sales facility program at December 31, 2012. We also had no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2012, except for $43 million of standby letters of credit. Our revolving credit and committed receivables sales facility programs require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio, as of any fiscal quarter end, of at least 4-to-1 and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.25-to-1. As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.On November 6, 2012, we renewed our $950 million committed receivables sales facility program until November 6, 2014.Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures during the six months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were $62 million and $101 million, respectively, which were primarily related to information technology projects.DividendsOn October 30, 2012, we announced our 113th consecutive regular quarterly dividend, and increased the dividend by 16 percent to $0.275 per share, or $1.10 per share on an annualized basis. The dividend was paid on January 15, 2013 to shareholders of record on January 2, 2013.Share RepurchasesWe made no repurchases of our Common Shares during the three months ended December 31, 2012. During the three months ended September 30, 2012, we repurchased $200 million of our Common Shares. We funded the repurchases with available cash. We have $650 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization which expires August 31, 2015.Contractual ObligationsThere have been no material changes, outside of the ordinary course of business, in our outstanding contractual obligations since the end of fiscal 2012 and through December 31, 2012.16Table of ContentsRecent Financial Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 of the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards.Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting EstimatesRefer to the Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates section of "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2012 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates since the end of fiscal 2012 and through December 31, 2012; however, we have disclosed updated information regarding an area of sensitive accounting estimates below.GoodwillPurchased goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist. We performed annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill.Primarily due to reductions in anticipated future cash flows as a result of significant softness in the low-energy diagnostics market served by our nuclear pharmacy services division, we performed interim goodwill impairment testing for this reporting unit during the three months ended December 31, 2012. The carrying value of this reporting unit at December 31, 2012 was $1.0 billion, of which $829 million was goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated to be approximately 20 percent in excess of its carrying value, using a combination of the income-based approach (using a discount rate of 9 percent) and the market-based approach. If we alter our testing by increasing the discount rate in the  income-based approach discounted cash flow analysis by 1 percent, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would be approximately $1.1 billion, or 10 percent in excess of its carrying value.Our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting unit is based on a combination of the income-based and market-based approaches. Under the market-based approach, we determine fair value by comparing our reporting unit to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Our weighting of the income-based and market-based approaches can change based on the availability of public data from similar businesses or guideline companies. Under the income-based approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return. Future anticipated cash flows are based on our long-term strategic business plans, and a terminal value is used to estimate the reporting unit's cash flows beyond this plan. The discount rate represents the weighted-average cost of capital, which is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants. The use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment.We concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill because the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Future unfavorable changes in anticipated cash flows, estimated terminal value, or discount rates, could materially affect our estimate of fair value and potentially result in goodwill impairment.17Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe believe there have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative market risks since our 2012 Form 10-K.Item 4: Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2012. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2012, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.In fiscal 2012, the Medical segment implemented a business transformation project, including a new information system for certain supply chain and financial processes, which constituted a material change to our internal control over financial reporting. To support our internal control over financial reporting during the implementation and initial operation of the new system, we established temporary compensating controls that were largely eliminated during the three months ended September 30, 2012. Although implementation of the new system is substantially complete, the Medical segment added temporary compensating controls during the three months ended December 31, 2012 and continues to refine some processes and may add additional temporary compensating controls. However, we do not expect any of these refinements or temporary compensating controls to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.18Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesPart II. Other InformationItem 1: Legal ProceedingsIn addition to the proceedings described below, the legal proceedings described in Note 6 of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" are incorporated in this "Item 1: Legal Proceedings" by reference.In May and June 2012, Herman Kleid and Henry Stanley, Jr., each purported shareholders, filed derivative actions on behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the current and certain former members of our Board of Directors. A similar action was filed by Daniel Himmel, a purported shareholder, in the Common Pleas Court of Delaware County, Ohio and included certain of our officers as defendants. The complaints allege that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the DEA's recent suspension of our Lakeland, Florida distribution center's registration to distribute controlled substances, and the suspension and reinstatement of such registrations at three of our facilities in 2007 and 2008. The Himmel action also makes claims based on corporate waste and unjust enrichment. The complaints seek, among other things, unspecified money damages against the defendants and an award of attorney's fees. In July and August 2012, the defendants filed motions to dismiss all three complaints. In October 2012, Herman Kleid voluntarily dismissed his complaint without prejudice and the court dismissed the Stanley action with prejudice. In November 2012, the plaintiff in the Stanley action filed a notice of appeal regarding the court's decision.Separately, in September 2012, a purported shareholder made demand on our Board of Directors to take action against the current and certain former members of our Board of Directors to recover damages based on allegations similar to those set forth in the derivative actions above. Our Board of Directors has formed a special committee of independent directors to investigate the allegations made in the shareholder demand. The special committee's investigation is ongoing.Item 1A: Risk FactorsYou should carefully consider the information in this Form 10-Q and the risk factors discussed in "Item 1A: Risk Factors" and other risks discussed in our 2012 Form 10-K and our filings with the SEC since June 30, 2012.  These risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. Our business also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations.Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
