Item 1A: Risk Factors" of our 2012 Form 10-K. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.OverviewWe are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies, hospitals, surgery centers, physician offices and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs, enhancing efficiency and improving quality. We report our financial results in two segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical.Revenue for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013 was $24.6 billion and $75.7 billion, a 9 percent and 6 percent decrease, respectively, from the prior-year periods, largely due to the previously disclosed expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Express Scripts, Inc. and the impact of brand-to-generic pharmaceutical conversions. Gross margin increased 7 percent to $1.3 billion and 8 percent to $3.7 billion for these periods, respectively, reflecting strong performance in our Pharmaceutical segment generic programs. Operating earnings decreased 10 percent to $475 million and increased 4 percent to $1.4 billion for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013, respectively. The decrease in operating earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2013 was impacted by a $55 million gain realized during the prior-year period upon adjusting the contingent consideration obligation associated with the acquisition of Healthcare Solutions Holding, LLC ("P4 Healthcare"). Contributing to the increase in operating earnings for the nine months ended March 31, 2013 was $37 million of income from settlements of class action antitrust claims. Earnings from continuing operations were up 4 percent to $346 million and 10 percent to $921 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations for both periods were favorably impacted by $64 million relating to revaluation of the deferred tax liability and related interest on unrepatriated foreign earnings as a result of an agreement with tax authorities.Our cash and equivalents balance was $2.3 billion at both March 31, 2013  and June 30, 2012. For the nine months ended March 31, 2013, our cash and equivalents balance was impacted by net cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion and proceeds from long-term obligations of $1.3 billion, offset by acquisitions of $2.2 billion, cash dividends of $258 million and share repurchases of $200 million. We plan to continue to execute a balanced deployment of available capital to position ourselves for sustainable competitive advantage and to enhance shareholder value.Restructuring On January 30, 2013, we announced a restructuring plan within our Medical segment. Under this restructuring plan, we expect to, among other things, move production of procedure kits from our facility in Waukegan, Illinois to other facilities and sell property and consolidate office space in Waukegan, Illinois. In addition, we are reorganizing our Medical segment organization and plan to sell our sterilization processes in El Paso, Texas. We estimate the total costs associated with this restructuring plan to be approximately $79 million on a pre-tax basis, of which $40 million was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2013. Of the approximately $39 million remaining costs to be recognized through the end of fiscal 2014, we estimate that approximately $9 million will be employee-related costs, approximately $16 million will be facility exit and other costs and approximately $14 million will be an expected loss on disposal of assets. These costs are being recorded as restructuring and employee severance and impairments and loss on disposal of assets in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. We expect to start realizing cost savings and other benefits from the plan in fiscal 2014. Large CustomersOn March 19, 2013, we announced that our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreen Co. (“Walgreens”), which is scheduled to expire at the end of August 2013, will not be renewed. Sales to Walgreens generated approximately 21 percent of our consolidated revenue for fiscal 2012. Approximately 60 percent of this revenue from Walgreens was classified as bulk sales, which, as described in our 2012 Form 10-K, generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than non-bulk sales. For fiscal 2012, Walgreens bulk and non-bulk sales generated less segment profit as a percentage of revenue (which includes allocation of variable and non-variable segment expenses) than the segment profit percentages for bulk and non-bulk sales reported in the 2012 Form 10-K. After the expiration of this contract, we anticipate a significant net working capital decrease based on reduced inventory and accounts receivable, partially offset by reduced accounts payable. Based on the expected working capital decrease and other factors, we anticipate that the expiration of the Walgreens contract will result in a net after-tax benefit to cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2014 in excess of $500 million. We are taking steps to reduce our costs and otherwise mitigate the impact of the expiration of the Walgreens contract in fiscal 2014 and afterward.On April 25, 2013, we announced the renewal of our pharmaceutical distribution contracts with CVS Caremark Corporation ("CVS"). CVS accounted for approximately 22 percent of our fiscal 2012 revenue.AcquisitionsOn March 18, 2013, we completed the acquisition of AssuraMed, Inc. ("AssuraMed") for $2.07 billion, net of cash acquired, in an all-cash transaction. We funded the acquisition through the issuance of $1.3 billion in fixed rate notes and cash on hand. The acquisition of AssuraMed, a provider of medical supplies to patients in the home, expands our ability 15Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)to serve this patient base. We expect the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets to be a significant expense in future periods. Excluding the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, we expect this acquisition to have a positive impact on operating earnings in future periods. See Note 2 of the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on the AssuraMed acquisition.

(approximately $2.3 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively), the revenue from which was classified as bulk sales. Revenue from existing pharmaceutical distribution customers decreased by approximately $1.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, primarily as a result of brand-to-generic pharmaceutical conversions. Brand-to-generic pharmaceutical conversions impact our revenue because generic pharmaceuticals generally sell at a lower price than the corresponding brand product and because some of our customers primarily source generic products directly from manufacturers rather than purchasing from us. The decrease was partially offset by increased pharmaceutical distribution revenue from new customers (approximately $1.1 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively) and revenue growth within our specialty solutions division ($260 million and $772 million, respectively).Non-bulk sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2013 compared to the prior-year period increased by 7 percent driven by growth from new customers. Bulk sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2013 decreased by 26 percent driven primarily by the loss of our contract with Express Scripts, Inc. and brand-to-generic conversions.Medical SegmentRevenue for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013 compared to the prior-year periods reflects the benefit of acquisitions ($72 million and $175 million, respectively).Cost of Products SoldConsistent with the decrease in revenue, cost of products sold during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013 decreased $2.5 billion (10  percent) and $5.4 billion (7 percent), respectively, compared to the prior-year periods. See the gross margin discussion below for additional drivers impacting cost of products sold.Gross Margin Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeGross margin$1,291 $1,207 7% Nine Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeGross margin$3,673 $3,405 8%Pharmaceutical SegmentGross margin increased $68 million and $200 million during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013, respectively, compared to the prior-year periods driven by strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs (approximately $82 million and $284 million, respectively). Increased margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements (exclusive of the related volume impact) also had a positive impact on gross margin (approximately $33 million and $57 million, respectively). Pharmaceutical distribution customer pricing changes, including rebates (exclusive of the related volume impact), adversely impacted gross margin by an estimated $43 million and $116 million, respectively. The adverse impact of these customer pricing changes for any particular customer is often partially offset by product mix, sourcing programs and other sources of margin. As described above, brand-to-generic conversions and the expiration of the Express Scripts, Inc. contract resulted in lower revenue; however, these items did not have a significant impact on gross margin. As a result of significant market softness, gross margin from our nuclear pharmacy services division decreased by $13 million and $55 million during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013, respectively.Medical SegmentGross margin increased $15 million and $65 million during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013, respectively, compared to the prior-year periods. Acquisitions positively impacted gross margin by $17 million and $39 million, respectively. Decreases in the cost of commodities used in our self-manufactured products increased gross margin by $12 million and $28 million, respectively. Favorable product mix positively impacted gross margin by $10 million and $20 million, respectively. These items were partially offset by the adverse impact of customer pricing changes ($14 million and $36 million, respectively), driven in part by customer mix. Gross margin was also moderated by softness in procedural-based utilization.SG&A Expenses Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeSG&A expenses$712 $683 4% Nine Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeSG&A expenses$2,099 $1,966 7%SG&A expenses increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013 primarily due to acquisitions ($18 million and $41 million, respectively), investment spending and other strategic priorities ($10 16Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)million and $22 million, respectively) and business system investments.Segment Profit and Consolidated Operating Earnings Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangePharmaceutical$498 $446 12 %Medical100 89 12 %Total segment profit598 535 12 %Corporate(123) (8) N.M.Total operating earnings$475 $527 (10)% Nine Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangePharmaceutical$1,339 $1,204 11%Medical268 253 6%Total segment profit1,607 1,457 10%Corporate(168) (69) N.M.Total operating earnings$1,439 $1,388 4%Pharmaceutical Segment ProfitThe principal drivers for the increase during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013 were strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs and increased margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements. These benefits were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of pharmaceutical distribution customer pricing changes and significant market softness in our nuclear pharmacy services division. See the discussion of gross margin above for further information on these drivers.Medical Segment ProfitThe increase during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013 resulted from the decreased cost of commodities used in our self-manufactured products, favorable product mix and the positive impact of acquisitions, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of customer pricing changes, driven in part by customer mix. See the discussion of gross margin above for further information on these drivers. We also expensed $4 million for the 2.3 percent excise tax on certain manufactured or imported medical devices that began January 1, 2013.Consolidated Operating EarningsIn addition to revenue, gross margin and SG&A expenses discussed above, operating earnings were impacted by the following: Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2013 2012Restructuring and employee severance$33 $7Acquisition-related costs53 (27)Impairments and loss on disposal of assets21 17Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net(3) — Nine Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2013 2012Restructuring and employee severance$39 $12Acquisition-related costs106 23Impairments and loss on disposal of assets27 19Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net(37) (3)Restructuring and Employee SeveranceDuring the three months ended March 31, 2013, we recognized $25 million of employee-related costs and $4 million of facility exit and other costs  related to the restructuring plan within our Medical segment.Acquisition-Related CostsAcquisition-related costs during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013 included transaction costs associated with the purchase of AssuraMed ($18 million). Additionally, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $26 million and $69 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013, respectively, and $20 million and $58 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2012, respectively. Acquisition-related costs for the three months ended March 31, 2012 included income recognized upon adjusting the contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with the P4 Healthcare acquisition ($55 million).Impairments and Loss on Disposal of AssetsIn connection with our Medical segment restructuring plan, during the three months ended March 31, 2013, we recognized an $11 million loss to write down our gamma sterilization assets in El Paso, Texas to the estimated fair value less costs to sell. Also during the three months ended March 31, 2013, we recorded an $8 million write-off of commercial software under development within our Pharmaceutical segment in connection with our decision to discontinue this project. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, we recorded a charge of $16 million to write off an indefinite-life intangible asset related to the P4 Healthcare trade name.Litigation (Recoveries)/Charges, NetDuring the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013, we recognized $3 million and $37 million, respectively, of income resulting from settlements of class action antitrust claims in which we were a class member.Earnings Before Income Taxes and Discontinued OperationsIn addition to the items discussed above, earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following: Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeOther income, net$(6) $(7) N.M.Interest expense, net34 24 42% Nine Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeOther income, net$(17) $(3) N.M.Interest expense, net87 70 24%Provision for Income TaxesFluctuations in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax earnings (“effective tax rate”) are due to changes in international and U.S. state effective tax rates and discrete items.During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013, the effective tax rate of 22.7 percent and 32.7 percent was impacted by net favorable discrete items of $57 million and $51 million, or 12.7 and 3.7 percentage points, respectively. The discrete items include the favorable impact of revaluation of the deferred tax liability and related interest on unrepatriated foreign earnings as a result of an agreement with tax authorities ($64 million), partially offset by unfavorable amounts related to remeasuring certain unrecognized tax benefits.17Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)During the three months ended March 31, 2012, the effective tax rate of 34.9 percent was impacted by net favorable discrete items of $4 million, or 0.7 percentage points. This included the favorable impact of settlement of federal, foreign and state tax controversies ($36 million), a favorable impact from the related reduction for interest on unrepatriated foreign earnings ($9 million) and a net unfavorable impact of remeasuring some current and prior-years' unrecognized tax benefits primarily as a result of ongoing negotiations with tax authorities ($44 million).During the nine months ended March 31, 2012, the effective tax rate of 36.9 percent was impacted by net unfavorable discrete items of $5 million, or 0.4 percentage points. The discrete items included unfavorable amounts related to remeasuring certain unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the favorable impact of settling certain federal, state and foreign tax matters.Ongoing AuditsThe IRS is currently conducting audits of fiscal years 2003 through 2010. We have received proposed adjustments from the IRS for fiscal years 2003 through 2007 related to our transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among subsidiaries of an acquired entity prior to its acquisition by us. The IRS has proposed additional taxes of $849 million, excluding penalties and interest. If this tax ultimately must be paid, CareFusion is liable under the tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the Spin-Off for $592 million of the total amount. We disagree with these proposed adjustments, which we are contesting, and have accounted for the unrecognized tax benefits related to them.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe currently believe that, based upon available capital resources (cash on hand), projected operating cash flow and access to committed credit facilities, we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs; currently anticipated capital expenditures, business growth and expansion; contractual obligations; payments for tax settlements; and current and projected debt service requirements, dividends and share repurchases.Cash and EquivalentsOur cash and equivalents balance was $2.3 billion at both March 31, 2013, and June 30, 2012. At March 31, 2013, our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments. For the nine months ended March 31, 2013, our cash and equivalents balance was impacted by net cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion and proceeds from long-term obligations of $1.3 billion, offset by acquisitions of $2.2 billion, cash dividends of $258 million and share repurchases of $200 million.We use days sales outstanding (“DSO”), days inventory on hand (“DIOH”) and days payable outstanding (“DPO”) to evaluate our working capital performance. DSO is calculated as trade receivables, net divided by (quarterly revenue divided by 90 days). DIOH is calculated as inventories divided by ((quarterly cost of products sold plus chargeback billings) divided by 90 days). DPO is calculated as accounts payable divided by ((quarterly cost of products sold plus chargeback billings) divided by 90 days). Chargeback billings are the difference between a product’s wholesale acquisition cost and the contract price. Chargeback billings were $4.0 billion and $3.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013,  we changed our method of calculating DSO in order to align it with the 90-day convention that we use in the calculation of DIOH and DPO. Prior to this change, we calculated DSO by dividing trade receivables, net by (monthly revenue divided by 30 days). In connection with this change, we have revised prior-year information to conform to the new method of calculating DSO. March 31, 2013 2012Days sales outstanding23.5 21.7Days inventory on hand27.5 25.0Days payable outstanding39.8 38.3Changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of inventory purchases, customer payments of accounts receivable and payments to vendors in the regular course of business.DSO increased primarily as a result of the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Express Scripts, Inc. DIOH and DPO increased primarily due to the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Express Scripts, Inc. and brand-to-generic conversions.The cash and equivalents balance at March 31, 2013 included $369 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation, permanently bringing the money into the United States could trigger U.S. federal, state and local income tax obligations. As a U.S. parent company, we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to U.S. federal income tax through intercompany loans.Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperOur sources of liquidity include a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a $950 million committed receivables sales facility program. At times, availability under our committed receivables sales facility program may be less than $950 million based on receivables concentration limits and our outstanding eligible receivables balance. We also have a commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion, backed by the revolving credit facility.We had no outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program and no outstanding balance under the committed receivables sales facility program at March 31, 2013. We also had no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at March 31, 2013, except for $43 million of standby letters of credit. Our revolving credit and committed receivables sales facility programs require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio, as of any fiscal quarter end, of at least 4-to-1 and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.25-to-1. As of March 31, 2013, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.On November 6, 2012, we renewed our $950 million committed receivables sales facility program until November 6, 2014.Long-term ObligationsOn February 19, 2013, we sold in a registered offering $400 million aggregate principal amount of 1.7% notes that mature on March 15, 2018, $550 million aggregate principal amount of 3.2% notes that mature on March 15, 2023 and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.6% notes that mature on March 15, 2043 (collectively, the "Notes").Funding of AssuraMed Acquisition We funded the acquisition of AssuraMed through the issuance of $1.3 billion in the Notes described above and cash on hand. We obtained a 18Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)commitment letter in February 2013 from certain financial institutions for a $1.3 billion unsecured bridge term loan facility that could be used to complete the acquisition. We incurred fees of $5 million related to the facility, which are included in interest expense, net. No amounts were drawn under the facility and we terminated the commitment letter in connection with the Notes offering.Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures during the nine months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 were $103 million and $158 million, respectively, which were primarily related to information technology projects.DividendsOn February 6, 2013, our Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.275 per share, or $1.10 per share on an annualized basis, which was paid on April 15, 2013 to shareholders of record on April 1, 2013.On May 1, 2013, our Board of Directors approved our 115th consecutive regular quarterly dividend, and increased the dividend by 10 percent to $0.3025 per share, or $1.21 per share on an annualized basis. The dividend is payable on July 15, 2013 to shareholders of record on July 1, 2013.Share RepurchasesDuring the three months ended September 30, 2012, we repurchased $200 million of our Common Shares. We funded the repurchases with available cash. We made no other repurchases during the nine months ended March 31, 2013 and have $650 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization which expires August 31, 2015.Contractual ObligationsOther than the issuance of the Notes, there have been no material changes, outside of the ordinary course of business, in our outstanding contractual obligations since the end of fiscal 2012 and as of March 31, 2013.Recent Financial Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 of the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards.Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting EstimatesRefer to the Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates section of "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2012 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates since the end of fiscal 2012 and  through March 31, 2013; however, we have disclosed updated information regarding an area of sensitive accounting estimates below.GoodwillGoodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist. We performed annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill.During the three months ended December 31, 2012, we performed interim goodwill impairment testing for our nuclear pharmacy services division, primarily due to reductions in anticipated future cash flows as a result of significant softness in the low-energy diagnostics market served by this reporting unit. The carrying value of this reporting unit at December 31, 2012 was $1.0 billion, of which $829 million was goodwill. We concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill because the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated to be approximately 20 percent in excess of its carrying value, using a combination of the income-based approach (using a discount rate of 9 percent) and the market-based approach. If we alter our testing by increasing the discount rate in the income-based approach discounted cash flow analysis by 1 percent, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would be approximately $1.1 billion, or 10 percent in excess of its carrying value. There were no events or changes in circumstances during the three months ended March 31, 2013 that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our nuclear pharmacy services division below its carrying value.Our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting unit is based on a combination of the market-based and income-based approaches. Under the market-based approach, we determine fair value by comparing our reporting unit to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Our weighting of the income-based and market-based approaches can change based on the availability of public data from similar businesses or guideline companies. Under the income-based approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return. Future anticipated cash flows are based on our long-term strategic business plans, and a terminal value is used to estimate the reporting unit's cash flows beyond this plan. The discount rate represents the weighted-average cost of capital, which is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants. Future unfavorable changes in anticipated cash flows, estimated terminal value or discount rates, or future changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect our estimate of fair value and potentially result in goodwill impairment.19Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe believe there have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative market risks since our 2012 Form 10-K.Item 4: Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of March 31, 2013. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our  disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2013, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.20Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesPart II. Other InformationItem 1: Legal ProceedingsIn addition to the proceedings described below, the legal proceedings described in Note 8 of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" are incorporated in this "Item 1: Legal Proceedings" by reference.In May and June 2012, Herman Kleid and Henry Stanley, Jr., each purported shareholders, filed derivative actions on behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the current and certain former members of our Board of Directors. A similar action was filed by Daniel Himmel, a purported shareholder, in the Common Pleas Court of Delaware County, Ohio and included certain of our officers as defendants. The complaints allege that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration's recent suspension of our Lakeland, Florida distribution center's registration to distribute controlled substances, and the suspension and reinstatement of such registrations at three of our facilities in 2007 and 2008. The Himmel action also makes claims based on corporate waste and unjust enrichment. The complaints seek, among other things, unspecified money damages against the defendants and an award of attorney's fees. In July and August 2012, the defendants filed motions to dismiss all three complaints. In October 2012, Herman Kleid voluntarily dismissed his complaint without prejudice and the court dismissed the Stanley action with prejudice. In November 2012, the plaintiff in the Stanley action filed a notice of appeal regarding the court's decision.Separately, in September 2012, a purported shareholder made demand on our Board of Directors to take action against the current and certain former members of our Board of Directors to recover damages based on allegations similar to those set forth in the derivative actions above. Our Board of Directors has formed a special committee of independent directors to investigate the allegations made in the shareholder demand. The special committee has completed its investigation and its recommendation will be considered by the Board of Directors. Item 1A: Risk FactorsYou should carefully consider the information in this Form 10-Q and the risk factors discussed in "Item 1A: Risk Factors" and other risks discussed in our 2012 Form 10-K and our filings with the SEC since June 30, 2012. These risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. Our business also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations. Our recent AssuraMed acquisition is subject to the risks described in our 2012 Form 10-K risk factor entitled “Acquisitions are not always as successful as we expect them to be.”Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
