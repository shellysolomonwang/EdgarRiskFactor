Item 1A: Risk Factors" of our 2013 Form 10-K. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.OverviewWe are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories, physician offices and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs, enhancing efficiency and improving quality. We also provide medical products to patients in the home. We report our financial results in two segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical.Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2013 was $24.5 billion, a 5 percent decrease from the prior year largely due to the previously disclosed expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contracts with Walgreen Co. ("Walgreens") on August 31, 2013 and Express Scripts, Inc. ("Express Scripts") on September 30, 2012. Gross margin increased 9 percent to $1.3 billion and operating earnings increased 3 percent to $471 million, reflecting strong performance in our Pharmaceutical segment generic programs and the impact of acquisitions. Earnings from continuing operations were up 25 percent to $340 million primarily due to a $63 million favorable impact from the settlement of federal and state tax controversies.Our cash and equivalents balance was $2.8 billion at September 30, 2013, compared to $1.9 billion at June 30, 2013. The increase in cash and equivalents during the quarter was driven by net cash provided by operating activities of $951 million, due primarily to the decrease in our net working capital associated with the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens. We plan to continue to execute a balanced deployment of available capital to position ourselves for sustainable competitive advantage and to enhance shareholder value. Walgreens ContractThe expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens resulted in a reduction in revenue of $1.7 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2013. Given the nature of the wind-down of the Walgreens contract, the contract expiration did not significantly impact our operating earnings compared to the prior-year period. We expect the contract expiration to have an adverse impact on our period-over-period comparisons of revenue and results of operations during the remainder of fiscal 2014 and the first quarter of fiscal 2015.AcquisitionsWe did not complete any acquisitions that were significant, individually or in the aggregate, during the three months ended September 30, 2013. In March 2013, we acquired AssuraMed, Inc. ("AssuraMed"), a provider of medical supplies to homecare providers and patients in the home. This acquisition increased revenues and operating earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2013.Results of OperationsRevenue Three Months Ended September 30  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangePharmaceutical$21,813 $23,498 (7)%Medical2,711 2,393 13 %Total segment revenue24,524 25,891 (5)%Corporate(1) (2) N.M.Total revenue$24,523 $25,889 (5)%Pharmaceutical SegmentRevenue for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the prior-year period was negatively impacted by the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contracts with Express Scripts ($2.0 billion) and Walgreens ($1.7 billion), partially offset by increased volume from new and existing pharmaceutical distribution customers ($1.7 billion). Revenue was also favorably impacted by growth within our Specialty Solutions division ($244 million).Medical SegmentRevenue for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the prior-year period reflects the benefit of acquisitions ($269 million) and increased net volume from existing customers ($73 million).Cost of Products SoldAs a result of the same factors affecting the change in revenue, cost of products sold decreased $1.5 billion (6 percent) compared to the prior-year period. See the gross margin discussion below for additional drivers impacting cost of products sold.Gross Margin Three Months Ended September 30 (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeGross margin$1,264 $1,159 9%Gross margin increased during the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the prior-year period, driven by strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs ($115 million) and the impact of acquisitions ($73 million). Strong performance under our branded 14Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)pharmaceutical distribution agreements (exclusive of the related volume impact) also had a positive impact on gross margin ($20 million). Pricing changes, including rebates (exclusive of the related volume impact), adversely impacted gross margin ($113 million), driven by renewed customer contracts and customer and product mix. The adverse impact of these pricing changes was offset by sourcing programs and other sources of margin. While the expirations of the Walgreens and Express Scripts contracts resulted in lower revenue, they did not significantly impact gross margin.Distribution, Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses Three Months Ended September 30  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeSG&A expenses$732 $690 6%SG&A expenses increased during the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the prior-year period primarily due to acquisitions ($39 million).Segment Profit and Consolidated Operating Earnings Three Months Ended September 30  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangePharmaceutical$433 $400 8%Medical106 74 43%Total segment profit539 474 14%Corporate(68) (17) N.M.Total operating earnings$471 $457 3%Pharmaceutical Segment ProfitThe principal drivers for the increase in Pharmaceutical segment profit during the three months ended September 30, 2013 were strong performances from both our generic pharmaceutical programs and our branded pharmaceutical distribution agreements. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of pharmaceutical distribution customer pricing changes. The expiration of the Walgreens and Express Scripts contracts did not significantly impact segment profit.Medical Segment ProfitThe principal driver for the increase in Medical segment profit during the three months ended September 30, 2013 was the positive impact of acquisitions.Consolidated Operating EarningsIn addition to revenue, gross margin and SG&A expenses discussed above, operating earnings were impacted by the following: Three Months Ended September 30(in millions)2013 2012Restructuring and employee severance$11 $5Amortization and other acquisition-related costs49 28Impairments and loss on disposal of assets— 1Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net1 (22) Restructuring and Employee SeveranceWe recognized $6 million related to the restructuring within our Medical segment during the three months ended September 30, 2013. Amortization and Other Acquisition-Related CostsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $45 million and $21 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in amortization during the three months ended September 30, 2013 was primarily due to intangible assets from the acquisition of AssuraMed.Litigation (Recoveries)/Charges, NetDuring the three months ended September 30, 2012, we recognized $22 million of income resulting from settlements of class action antitrust claims in which we were a class member.Earnings Before Income Taxes and Discontinued OperationsIn addition to the items discussed above, earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following: Three Months Ended September 30  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeOther income, net$(4) $(8) N.M.Interest expense, net33 26 28%Interest Expense, NetThe increase in interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the prior-year period was primarily due to $1.3 billion of notes issued in connection with the AssuraMed acquisition during the third quarter of fiscal 2013.Provision for Income TaxesGenerally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and U.S. state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items.During the three months ended September 30, 2013, the effective tax rate of 23.2 percent was impacted by net favorable discrete items of $61 million, which reduced the rate by 13.7 percentage points. The discrete items include the favorable impact of the settlement of federal and state tax controversies ($63 million).During the three months ended September 30, 2012, the effective tax rate of 38.1 percent was impacted by net unfavorable discrete items of $4 million, which increased the rate by 1.0 percentage point. The discrete items include unfavorable amounts related to remeasurement of certain unrecognized tax benefits.In fiscal 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on discrete items, and we anticipate that the fiscal 2014 effective tax rate will be higher than the rate for the three months ended September 30, 2013.Ongoing AuditsDuring the three months ended September 30, 2013, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") closed audits of fiscal years 2003 through 2005. The IRS is currently conducting audits of fiscal years 2006 through 2010.15Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe currently believe that, based upon available capital resources (cash on hand and access to committed credit facilities) and projected operating cash flow, we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs; currently anticipated capital expenditures, business growth and expansion; contractual obligations; payments for tax settlements; and current and projected debt service requirements, dividends and share repurchases. If we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions, depending on the size and timing of such transactions, we may need to access capital in addition to cash on hand and our existing committed credit facilities.Cash and EquivalentsOur cash and equivalents balance was $2.8 billion at September 30, 2013, compared to $1.9 billion at June 30, 2013. At September 30, 2013, our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments. The increase in cash and equivalents during the three months ended September 30, 2013 was driven by net cash provided by operating activities of $951 million and proceeds from the issuance of common shares in connection with employee stock option exercises of $102 million, offset by dividends of $105 million and share repurchases of $50 million. Net cash provided by operating activities of $951 million was driven primarily by the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens, which resulted in a significant net working capital decrease based on reduced accounts receivable and inventory, partially offset by reduced accounts payable. The majority of the expected net working capital decrease from the contract expiration occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2013. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by other changes in working capital, including the timing of payments of accounts payable.Changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as customer payments of accounts receivable, the timing of inventory purchases and payments to vendors in the regular course of business. We have historically presented days sales outstanding (“DSO”), days inventory on hand (“DIOH”) and days payable outstanding (“DPO”) to evaluate our working capital performance. Due to the expiration of the Walgreens contract on August 31, 2013, our revenue, cost of products sold and chargeback billings for the three months ended September 30, 2013 reflected two months of activity attributable to Walgreens, while our accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable balances at September 30, 2013 reflected the significant net working capital decrease described above. Accordingly, we do not believe DSO, DIOH and DPO provide meaningful measures of our working capital performance for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the prior-year period, and we have not presented these measures in this Form 10-Q.The cash and equivalents balance at September 30, 2013 included $475 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation, permanently bringing the money into the United States could trigger U.S. federal, state and local income tax obligations. As a U.S. parent company, we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to U.S. federal income tax through intercompany loans. Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperOn October 15, 2013, we reduced our committed receivables sales facility program from $950 million to $700 million in light of the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens. In addition to our committed receivables sales facility, our sources of liquidity include a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion, backed by the revolving credit facility.We had no outstanding balance under the committed receivables sales facility program and no outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program at September 30, 2013. We also had no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2013, except for $42 million of standby letters of credit. Our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility program require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio, as of any fiscal quarter end, of at least 4-to-1 and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.25-to-1. As of September 30, 2013, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures were $26 million during both the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.DividendsOn August 7, 2013, our Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.3025 per share, or $1.21 on an annualized basis, which was paid on October 15, 2013 to shareholders of record on October 1, 2013.On November 6, 2013, our Board of Directors approved our 117th consecutive regular quarterly dividend, payable to shareholders of record on January 2, 2014.Share RepurchasesDuring the three months ended September 30, 2013, we repurchased $50 million of our common shares. We funded the repurchases with cash on hand. At September 30, 2013, we had $350 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization which expires August 31, 2015.On October 29, 2013, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which expires on December 31, 2016.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements at September 30, 2013.Contractual ObligationsThere have been no material changes, outside of the ordinary course of business, in our outstanding contractual obligations since the end of fiscal 2013 through September 30, 2013.Recent Financial Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 of the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards.16Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting EstimatesRefer to the Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates section of "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2013 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates since the end of fiscal 2013 through September 30, 2013.Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe believe there have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative market risks since our 2013 Form 10-K.Item 4: Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) as of September 30, 2013. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2013 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.17Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesPart II. Other InformationItem 1: Legal ProceedingsIn addition to the proceedings described below, the legal proceedings described in Note 6 of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" are incorporated in this "Item 1: Legal Proceedings" by reference.In June 2012, Henry Stanley, Jr., a purported shareholder, filed a derivative action on behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (the "federal action") against the current and certain former members of our Board of Directors. A similar action was filed by Daniel Himmel, a purported shareholder, in the Common Pleas Court of Delaware County, Ohio (the "state action") against the current and certain former members of our Board of Directors and certain of our officers. The complaints alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the DEA's suspension of our Lakeland, Florida distribution center's registration to distribute controlled substances in February 2012, and the suspension and reinstatement of such registrations at three of our facilities in 2007 and 2008. The state action also made claims based on corporate waste and unjust enrichment. The complaints sought, among other things, unspecified money damages from the defendants and an award of attorney's fees. In October 2012, the U.S. District Court dismissed the federal action with prejudice, and in August 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the decision. In July 2013, the Common Pleas Court dismissed the state action, and in October 2013, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed an appeal of the court's decision with prejudice. In September 2013, the plaintiff in the federal action made demand on our Board of Directors to take action against current and certain former members of our Board of Directors to recover damages based on the allegations made in the federal action. Our Board of Directors, through a special committee of independent directors, is investigating the allegations made in the demand.Item 1A: Risk FactorsYou should carefully consider the information in this Form 10-Q and the risk factors discussed in "Item 1A: Risk Factors" and other risks discussed in our 2013 Form 10-K and our filings with the SEC since June 30, 2013. These risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. Our business also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations.
