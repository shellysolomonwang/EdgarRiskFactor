Item 1A: Risk Factors" of this Form 10-Q, Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-Q and "Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors" of our 2013 Form 10-K. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.OverviewWe are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories, physician offices and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs, enhancing efficiency and improving quality. We also provide medical products to patients in the home. We report our financial results in two segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical.Revenue for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014 was $21.4 billion and $68.2 billion, a 13 percent and 10 percent decrease, respectively, from the prior-year periods largely due to the previously disclosed expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreen Co. ("Walgreens") on August 31, 2013. Gross margin of $1.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2014 was flat compared to the prior-year period and increased 6 percent to $3.9 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2014, reflecting the positive impact of acquisitions, strong performance from generic programs, and the offsetting impact of the Walgreens contract expiration.Operating earnings increased 7 percent to $508 million and 4 percent to $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014, respectively. Operating earnings during the three months ended March 31, 2013 were impacted by $29 million of restructuring costs recognized in connection with a restructuring plan within our Medical segment.Earnings from continuing operations were down 9 percent to $315 million and up 1 percent to $929 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014, respectively. Both current-year periods benefited from a pre-tax gain of $32 million on the sale of our minority equity interests in  two investments. A $64 million revaluation of a deferred tax liability benefited both prior-year periods.Our cash and equivalents balance was $3.0 billion at March 31, 2014, compared to $1.9 billion at June 30, 2013. The increase in cash and equivalents during the nine months ended March 31, 2014 was driven by net cash provided by operating activities of $1.8 billion, which includes the decrease in our net working capital associated with the Walgreens contract expiration, partially offset by share repurchases of $389 million and dividends of $312 million. We plan to continue to execute a balanced deployment of available capital to position ourselves for sustainable competitive advantage and to enhance shareholder value.Walgreens ContractThe Walgreens contract expiration unfavorably impacted period-over-period comparisons of revenue and operating earnings during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014. We expect the contract expiration to have an adverse impact on our period-over-period comparisons of revenue and operating earnings during the remainder of fiscal 2014 and the first quarter of fiscal 2015.CVS Joint VentureIn December 2013, we announced an agreement with CVS Caremark Corporation (“CVS”) to form Red Oak Sourcing, LLC, a U.S.-based generic sourcing entity ("Sourcing JV"). Both companies are contributing their sourcing and supply chain expertise to the 50/50 joint venture and are committing to source generic pharmaceuticals through it. The Sourcing JV, which we expect to be operational as soon as July 1, 2014, will have an initial term of 10 years. Under this arrangement, the Sourcing JV will negotiate generic supply contracts on behalf of both companies; however, it will not own products or hold inventory on behalf of either company. The arrangement includes a quarterly payment of $25 million over the term that we will pay to CVS. No physical assets will be contributed by either company to the Sourcing JV, and minimal funding will be provided to capitalize the entity. The venture is subject to the completion of final documentation and customary closing conditions.AcquisitionsWe did not complete any acquisitions that were significant, individually or in the aggregate, during the nine months ended March 31, 2014. In March 2013, we acquired AssuraMed, Inc. ("AssuraMed"), a provider of medical supplies to homecare providers and patients in the home. This acquisition increased revenue and operating earnings for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014.On April 2, 2014, we announced an agreement to acquire Access Closure, Inc. ("AccessClosure") for $320 million in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition of AccessClosure, a manufacturer and distributor of extravascular closure devices, will expand our portfolio of physician preference items. We expect the transaction to close in May 2014, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory clearances.TrendsWhile pharmaceutical price appreciation on some generic products positively impacted our margins during the nine months ended March 31, 2014, the magnitude and timing of future generic price appreciation is uncertain.13Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)Results of OperationsRevenue Three Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangePharmaceutical$18,762 $22,070 (15)%Medical2,657 2,484 7 %Total segment revenue21,419 24,554 (13)%Corporate8 (2) N.M.Total revenue$21,427 $24,552 (13)% Nine Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangePharmaceutical$60,018 $68,314 (12)%Medical8,168 7,363 11 %Total segment revenue68,186 75,677 (10)%Corporate4 (4) N.M.Total revenue$68,190 $75,673 (10)%Pharmaceutical SegmentRevenue for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014 compared to the prior-year periods was negatively impacted by the Walgreens contract expiration ($4.9 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively). Revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2014 was also negatively impacted by the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Express Scripts, Inc. on September 30, 2012 ($2.0 billion). These decreases were partially offset by sales growth from new and existing pharmaceutical distribution customers during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014 ($1.6 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively).Medical SegmentRevenue for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014 compared to the prior-year periods reflects the benefit of acquisitions ($208 million and $755 million, respectively).Cost of Products SoldAs a result of the same factors affecting the change in revenue, cost of products sold decreased $3.1 billion (13 percent) and $7.7 billion (11 percent) compared to the prior-year periods. See the gross margin discussion below for additional drivers impacting cost of products sold.Gross Margin Three Months Ended March 31 (in millions)2014 2013 ChangeGross margin$1,297 $1,291 —% Nine Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangeGross margin$3,905 $3,673 6%Gross margin increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014 compared to the prior-year periods ($6 million and $232 million, respectively). Acquisitions positively impacted gross margin ($57 million and $207 million, respectively).Gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2014 was unfavorably impacted by $40 million due to lower sales, which included the impact of the Walgreens contract expiration, partially offset by sales growth from  new and existing customers. Gross margin for the nine months ended March 31, 2014 was positively impacted by $36 million due to sales growth, which included growth from new and existing customers, partially offset by the impact of the Walgreens contract expiration.Excluding the impact of the Walgreens contract expiration, gross margin rate was flat during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014. Margin rate benefited from strong performance from generic programs, including the impact of generic pharmaceutical price appreciation, and was adversely impacted by customer pricing changes.Distribution, Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses Three Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangeSG&A expenses$736 $712 3% Nine Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangeSG&A expenses$2,233 $2,099 6%SG&A expenses increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014 compared to the prior-year periods primarily due to acquisitions ($37 million and $113 million, respectively).Segment Profit and Consolidated Operating Earnings Three Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangePharmaceutical$452 $498 (9)%Medical111 100 11 %Total segment profit563 598 (6)%Corporate(55) (123) N.M.Total operating earnings$508 $475 7 % Nine Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangePharmaceutical$1,368 $1,339 2%Medical348 268 30%Total segment profit1,716 1,607 7%Corporate(218) (168) N.M.Total operating earnings$1,498 $1,439 4%Pharmaceutical Segment ProfitPharmaceutical segment profit for the three months ended March 31, 2014 was unfavorably impacted by lower sales, which included the impact of the Walgreens contract expiration, partially offset by sales growth from new and existing customers. Pharmaceutical segment profit for the nine months ended March 31, 2014 was positively impacted by sales growth, which included growth from new and existing customers, partially offset by the impact of the Walgreens contract expiration.Excluding the impact of the Walgreens contract expiration, the impact of gross margin rate on Pharmaceutical segment profit for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014 was flat. Margin rate benefited from strong performance from generic programs, including the impact of generic pharmaceutical price appreciation, and was adversely impacted by customer pricing changes.14Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)Medical Segment ProfitThe principal driver for the increase in Medical segment profit during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014 was the positive impact of acquisitions. Medical segment profit was also moderated by overall procedural volume softness and reductions in Presource kitting volumes.Consolidated Operating EarningsIn addition to revenue, gross margin and SG&A expenses discussed above, operating earnings were impacted by the following: Three Months Ended March 31(in millions)2014 2013Restructuring and employee severance$5 $33Amortization and other acquisition-related costs56 53Impairments and loss on disposal of assets— 21Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net(8) (3) Nine Months Ended March 31(in millions)2014 2013Restructuring and employee severance$25 $39Amortization and other acquisition-related costs160 106Impairments and loss on disposal of assets10 27Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net(21) (37)Restructuring and Employee SeveranceOn January 30, 2013, we announced a restructuring plan within our Medical segment. Under this restructuring plan, we have moved production of procedure kits from our facility in Waukegan, Illinois to other facilities, and we are selling property in Waukegan, Illinois. We recognized restructuring costs of $1 million and $13 million related to this plan during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014, respectively, and restructuring costs of $29 million related to this plan during both the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013.We estimate additional costs of $5 million to be recognized primarily through the end of fiscal 2014.Amortization and Other Acquisition-Related CostsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $46 million and $26 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $138 million and $69 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in amortization during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014 was primarily due to intangible assets from the acquisition of AssuraMed. We also recognized transaction costs associated with the purchase of AssuraMed of $18 million during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013. Impairments and Loss on Disposal of AssetsFor the nine months ended March 31, 2014, impairments and loss on disposal of assets included an $8 million loss to write down property in Waukegan, Illinois in connection with our Medical segment restructuring plan. For the three months ended March 31, 2013, impairments and loss on disposal of assets included an $11 million loss to write down our gamma sterilization assets in El Paso, Texas and an $8 million loss to write down commercial software under development.  Litigation (Recoveries)/Charges, NetWe recognized income resulting from settlements of class action antitrust claims in which we were a class member of $9 million and $3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $24 million and $37 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Earnings Before Income Taxes and Discontinued OperationsIn addition to the items discussed above, earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following: Three Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangeOther income, net$(33) $(6) N.M.Interest expense, net34 34 —% Nine Months Ended March 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangeOther income, net$(43) $(17) N.M.Interest expense, net100 87 15%Other Income, NetOther income, net for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014 included a $32 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of our minority equity interests in two investments.Interest Expense, NetThe increase in interest expense, net for the nine months ended March 31, 2014 compared to the prior-year period was primarily due to $1.3 billion of notes issued in connection with the AssuraMed acquisition during the third quarter of fiscal 2013.Provision for Income TaxesGenerally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and U.S. state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items.During the three months ended March 31, 2014, the effective tax rate of 38.0 percent was impacted by net unfavorable discrete items of $5 million, which increased the rate by 1.0 percentage point. The discrete items include the unfavorable impact of remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits ($5 million).During the nine months ended March 31, 2014, the effective tax rate of 35.5 percent was impacted by net favorable discrete items of $18 million, which reduced the rate by 1.2 percentage points. The discrete items include the favorable impact of the settlement of federal and state tax controversies ($67 million) and release of valuation allowance ($12 million) and the unfavorable impact of remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits ($61 million).During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013, the effective tax rates of 22.7 percent and 32.7 percent were impacted by net favorable discrete items of $57 million and $51 million, which decreased the rates by 12.7 and 3.7 percentage points, respectively. The discrete items for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013 include the favorable impact of revaluation of the deferred tax liability and related interest on unrepatriated foreign earnings as a result of an agreement with tax 15Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)authorities ($64 million), partially offset by unfavorable amounts related to remeasuring unrecognized tax benefits.Ongoing AuditsDuring the nine months ended March 31, 2014, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") closed audits of fiscal years 2003 through 2005. The IRS is currently conducting audits of fiscal years 2006 through 2010.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe currently believe that, based upon available capital resources (cash on hand and access to committed credit facilities) and projected operating cash flow, we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs; currently anticipated capital expenditures, business growth and expansion; contractual obligations; payments for tax settlements; and current and projected debt service requirements, dividends and share repurchases. If we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions, depending on the size and timing of such transactions, we may need to access capital in addition to cash on hand and our existing committed credit facilities.Cash and EquivalentsOur cash and equivalents balance was $3.0 billion at March 31, 2014, compared to $1.9 billion at June 30, 2013. At March 31, 2014, our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments. The increase in cash and equivalents during the nine months ended March 31, 2014 was driven by net cash provided by operating activities of $1.8 billion, partially offset by share repurchases of $389 million and dividends of $312 million. Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.8 billion included a significant net working capital decrease as a result of the Walgreens contract expiration.We use days sales outstanding (“DSO”), days inventory on hand (“DIOH”) and days payable outstanding (“DPO”) to evaluate our working capital performance. March 31 2014 2013Days sales outstanding20.2 23.5Days inventory on hand (1)28.7 27.5Days payable outstanding (1)39.0 39.8(1)Chargeback billings, which are used in the above calculations, were $5.1 billion and $4.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as customer payments of accounts receivable, the timing of inventory purchases and payments to vendors in the regular course of business. The changes in DSO and DIOH are primarily a result of the Walgreens contract expiration. DPO decreased primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors, partially offset by the impact of the Walgreens contract expiration.The cash and equivalents balance at March 31, 2014 included $482 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation, permanently bringing the money into the United States could trigger U.S. federal, state and local income tax obligations. As a U.S. parent company, we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to U.S. federal income tax through intercompany loans. Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperOn October 15, 2013, we reduced our committed receivables sales facility program from $950 million to $700 million in light of the Walgreens contract expiration. In addition to our committed receivables sales facility program, our sources of liquidity include a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion, backed by the revolving credit facility.We had no outstanding balance under the committed receivables sales facility program or under the revolving credit facility at March 31, 2014, except for standby letters of credit of $41 million under the committed receivables sales facility program. We had no outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program at March 31, 2014. Our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility program require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio, as of any fiscal quarter end, of at least 4-to-1 and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.25-to-1. As of March 31, 2014, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures were $138 million and $103 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.DividendsOn February 5, 2014, our Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.3025 per share, or $1.21 on an annualized basis, which was paid on April 15, 2014 to shareholders of record on April 1, 2014.Share RepurchasesDuring the nine months ended March 31, 2014, we repurchased $389 million of our common shares under our repurchase authorization which expires August 31, 2015. We funded the repurchases with cash on hand. At March 31, 2014, we had $11 million remaining under this repurchase authorization.On October 29, 2013, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which expires on December 31, 2016. At March 31, 2014, we had $1.0 billion remaining under this repurchase authorization.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements at March 31, 2014.Contractual ObligationsOther than our agreement with CVS to form the Sourcing JV, there has been no material change in our outstanding contractual obligations since the end of fiscal 2013 through March 31, 2014.Recent Financial Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 of the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards.Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting EstimatesRefer to the Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates section of "Part II, Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2013 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates since the end of fiscal 2013 through March 31, 2014.16Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThere have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative market risks since the end of fiscal 2013 through March 31, 2014 from those reported in our 2013 Form 10-K.Item 4: Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) as of March 31, 2014. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2014 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.17Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesPart II. Other InformationItem 1: Legal ProceedingsIn addition to the proceedings described below, the legal proceedings described in Note 7 of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" are incorporated in this "Item 1: Legal Proceedings" by reference.In June 2012, Henry Stanley, Jr., a purported shareholder, filed a derivative action on behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the current and certain former members of our Board of Directors. The complaint alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's suspension of our Lakeland, Florida distribution center's registration to distribute controlled substances in February 2012, and the suspension and reinstatement of such registrations at three of our facilities in 2007 and 2008. The complaint sought, among other things, unspecified money damages from the defendants and an award of attorney's fees. In October 2012, the U.S. District Court dismissed the derivative action with prejudice, and in August 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the decision. In September 2013, the plaintiff in the derivative action made demand on our Board of Directors to take action against current and certain former members of our Board of Directors to recover damages based on the allegations made in the derivative action. A special committee of independent directors investigated the allegations made in the demand. After receiving and evaluating the special committee's findings and recommendations, our Board of Directors determined in February 2014 that pursuing the claims set forth in the demand was not in the best interest of the company.Item 1A: Risk FactorsYou should carefully consider the information in this Form 10-Q and the risk factors discussed in "Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors" and other risks discussed in our 2013 Form 10-K and our filings with the SEC since June 30, 2013, including "Part II, Item 1A: Risk Factors" in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2013. These risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. Our business also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations.
