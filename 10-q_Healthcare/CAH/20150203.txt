Item 1A: Risk Factors" of our 2014 Form 10-K. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.OverviewWe are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies, hospitals and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs, enhancing efficiency and improving quality. We also provide medical products to patients in the home. We report our financial results in two segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical.Revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2014 was $25.5 billion and $49.6 billion, a 15 percent  and 6 percent increase, respectively, from the prior-year periods due primarily to sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers. Revenue was negatively impacted for the six months ended December 31, 2014 due to the previously disclosed expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreen Co. ("Walgreens") on August 31, 2013.Gross margin increased 8 percent to $1.5 billion and 7 percent to $2.8 billion for the three and six months ended December 31, 2014, respectively, reflecting sales growth from existing and new customers and strong performance from our Pharmaceutical segment generic programs, offset in part by customer pricing  changes. The increase for the six months ended December 31, 2014 was partially offset by the Walgreens contract expiration in the prior-year period.Operating earnings increased 5 percent to $546 million and 2 percent to $1.0 billion for the three and six months ended December 31, 2014, respectively, primarily due to the gross margin increase, partially offset by increased litigation charges.Earnings from continuing operations increased 5 percent to $289 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014, and decreased 10 percent to $555 million for the six months ended December 31, 2014. Both periods were impacted by the factors discussed above, a current-year loss on extinguishment of debt ($60 million) and a prior-year tax charge ($56 million). The decrease for the six months ended December 31, 2014 also reflects a $67 million favorable impact in the prior-year period from the settlement of tax controversies.Our cash and equivalents balance was $2.9 billion at both December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014. For the six months ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.0 billion was largely offset by share repurchases of $684 million and cash dividends of $233 million. In addition, we refinanced $1.2 billion of long-term debt at lower interest rates and longer maturities.Generic Sourcing Venture With CVS Health CorporationIn July 2014, we established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC (“Red Oak Sourcing”), a U.S.-based generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity with CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”) with an initial term of 10 years. Both companies have contributed sourcing and supply chain expertise to the generic sourcing venture and have committed to source generic pharmaceuticals through arrangements negotiated by it. Red Oak Sourcing negotiates generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of both companies, but does not own products or hold inventory on behalf of either company. We are required to pay 39 quarterly payments of $25.6 million to CVS which commenced in October 2014. In addition, only if certain milestones are achieved, we are required to pay additional predetermined amounts to CVS beginning in fiscal 2016. Beginning in the three months ended December 31, 2014, the $25.6 million payment is being expensed quarterly over the remaining term of the sourcing venture.16Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)Results of OperationsRevenue Three Months Ended December 31 (in millions)2014 2013 ChangePharmaceutical$22,627 $19,443 16%Medical2,914 2,799 4%Total segment revenue25,541 22,242 15%Corporate(4) (2) N.M.Total revenue$25,537 $22,240 15% Six Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangePharmaceutical$43,836 $41,256 6%Medical5,766 5,511 5%Total segment revenue49,602 46,767 6%Corporate5 (4) N.M.Total revenue$49,607 $46,763 6%Pharmaceutical SegmentCompared to the prior-year periods, revenue was positively impacted by sales growth from both existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers, which had a combined impact of $3.2 billion and $5.8 billion during the three and six months ended December 31, 2014, respectively. The increase for the six months ended December 31, 2014 was partially offset by the Walgreens contract expiration in the prior-year period ($3.3 billion). Medical SegmentRevenue growth for the three and six months ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior-year periods was due to acquisitions ($92 million and $189 million, respectively) and modest growth from existing customers.Cost of Products SoldAs a result of the same factors affecting the change in revenue, cost of products sold increased $3.2 billion (15 percent) and $2.7 billion (6 percent) compared to the prior-year periods. See the gross margin discussion below for additional drivers impacting cost of products sold.Gross Margin Three Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangeGross margin$1,454 $1,345 8% Six Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangeGross margin$2,794 $2,608 7% Consolidated gross margin increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior-year periods by $109 million and $186 million, respectively.Consolidated gross margin during the three and six months ended December 31, 2014 was positively impacted by sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers, and for the six months ending December 31, 2014 was negatively impacted by the Walgreens contract expiration. The net impact of these factors increased consolidated gross margin by $137 million and $191 million, respectively.Consolidated gross margin rate contracted during the three months ended December 31, 2014, which had an adverse impact on consolidated gross margin of $50 million for the period. Apart from the Walgreens contract expiration, consolidated gross margin rate also contracted during the six months ended December 31, 2014, which had an adverse impact on consolidated gross margin of $51 million for the period. Consolidated gross margin rate was adversely impacted by customer pricing changes, newly launched hepatitis C pharmaceutical products, and new customer mix. These were partially offset by strong performance from generic programs, which includes benefits from Red Oak Sourcing.Consolidated gross margin during the three and six months ended December 31, 2014 was positively impacted by acquisitions ($24 million and $48 million, respectively).Distribution, Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses Three Months Ended December 31 (in millions)2014 2013 ChangeSG&A expenses$815 $766 6% Six Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangeSG&A expenses$1,590 $1,497 6%The increase in SG&A expenses during the three and six months ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior-year period reflected acquisitions ($24 million and $51 million, respectively).Segment Profit and Consolidated Operating Earnings Three Months Ended December 31 (in millions)2014 2013 ChangePharmaceutical$542 $482 12 %Medical115 131 (12)%Total segment profit657 613 7 %Corporate(111) (94) N.M.Total operating earnings$546 $519 5 %17Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued) Six Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangePharmaceutical$992 $916 8 %Medical229 238 (4)%Total segment profit1,221 1,154 6 %Corporate(209) (164) N.M.Total operating earnings$1,012 $990 2 %Pharmaceutical Segment ProfitThe increase in Pharmaceutical segment profit during the three and six months ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior-year periods was positively impacted by sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers and strong performance from generic programs, partially offset by the adverse impact of customer pricing changes. Segment profit for the six months ended December 31, 2014 was negatively impacted by the Walgreens contract expiration in the prior-year period.Medical Segment ProfitThe principal drivers for the decrease in Medical segment profit during the three months ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior-year period were an increase in enterprise-wide incentive compensation and a decrease in earnings from our Canadian business. Medical segment profit for the six months ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior-year period benefited from our Cardinal Health brand products, and was reduced by national brand products.Consolidated Operating EarningsIn addition to revenue, gross margin and SG&A expenses discussed above, operating earnings were impacted by the following: Three Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangeRestructuring and employee severance$7 $10 N.M.Amortization and other acquisition-related costs60 56 N.M.Impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net(18) 9 N.M.Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net44 (15) N.M.

During the three months ended December 31, 2014, we also incurred litigation charges of $27 million related to the FTC investigation. These matters are discussed further in Note 8 of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements."Earnings Before Income Taxes and Discontinued OperationsIn addition to the items discussed above, earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following: Three Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2014 2013 ChangeOther income, net$(1) $(6) N.M.Interest expense, net36 33 10%Loss on extinguishment of debt60 — N.M.

See Note 6 of "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information.Provision for Income TaxesFluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and U.S. state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items. During the three months ended December 31, 2014, the effective tax rate of 36.0 percent was unfavorably impacted by 3.0 percentage points ($13 million) due to nondeductibility of litigation charges and favorably impacted by 3.1 percentage points ($14 million) related to a previously unrecognized tax benefit for a loss carryback from fiscal 2007.During the six months ended December 31, 2014, the effective tax rate of 37.4 percent was unfavorably impacted by 1.4 percentage points ($12 million) due to the remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits and 2.7 percentage points ($24  million) due to nondeductibility of litigation charges, partially offset by 1.6 percentage points ($14 million) due to adjusting deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances for the impact of Puerto Rico tax law changes enacted during the period and 1.6 percentage points ($14 million) related to a previously unrecognized tax benefit for a loss carryback from fiscal 2007.During the three months ended December 31, 2013, the effective tax rate of 44.1 percent was impacted by net unfavorable discrete items of $38 million, which increased the rate by 7.7 percentage points. The discrete items include the unfavorable impact of remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits ($56 million) as a result of proposed assessments of additional tax. During the six months ended December 31, 2013, the effective tax rate of 34.2 percent was impacted by net favorable discrete items of $23 million which reduced the rate by 2.4 percentage points. The discrete items include the favorable impact of the settlement of federal and state tax controversies ($67 million) and the unfavorable impact of remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits ($56 million).Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe currently believe that, based upon available capital resources (cash on hand and access to committed credit facilities) and projected operating cash flow, we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs; currently anticipated capital expenditures, business growth and expansion; contractual obligations; tax payments; and current and projected debt service requirements, dividends and share repurchases. If we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions, depending on the size and timing of such transactions, we may need to access capital in addition to cash on hand and our existing committed credit facilities. Cash and EquivalentsOur cash and equivalents balance was $2.9 billion at December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014. At December 31, 2014, our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments. For the six months ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.0 billion was largely offset by share repurchases of $684 million and cash dividends of $233 million. In addition, we refinanced $1.2 billion of long-term debt at lower interest rates and longer maturities. Changes in working capital, which impact operating cash flow, can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments, inventory purchases and payments to vendors in the regular course of business.The cash and equivalents balance at December 31, 2014 included $448 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation, permanently bringing the money into the United States could trigger U.S. federal, state and local income tax obligations. As a U.S. parent company, we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries through intercompany loans without becoming subject to U.S. federal income tax.Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperOn November 3, 2014, we renewed our committed receivables sales facility program through Cardinal Health Funding, LLC until November 3, 2017 and increased the size of the facility from $700 million to $950 million with the inclusion of certain receivables from the Medical segment. Other sources of liquidity include a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion, backed by the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2014, we had no outstanding balances or borrowings under these facilities, except for standby letters of credit of $41 million under the committed receivables sales facility program.Our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility program require us to maintain, as of any fiscal quarter end, a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 4-to-1 and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.25-to-1. As of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.Long-Term ObligationsIn November 2014, we sold $450 million aggregate principal amount of 2.4% Notes that mature on November 15, 2019, $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% Notes that mature on November 15, 2024, and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5% Notes that mature on November 15, 2044 in a registered offering.In December 2014, we used the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, to redeem all of the outstanding 4.0% Notes due 2015, 5.8% Notes due 2016, 5.85% Notes due 19Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)2017 and 6.0% Notes due 2017 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest, plus the make-whole premium applicable to each series of notes. As a result of this redemption, during the three months ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $60 million ($37 million, net of tax).Available-for-Sale SecuritiesAt December 31, 2014, we held $88 million of marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale.Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures were $83 million and $90 million during the six months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.DividendsOn November 5, 2014 our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.3425 per share, or $1.37 on an annualized basis, which was paid on January 15, 2015 to shareholders of record on January 2, 2015.Share RepurchasesDuring the six months ended December 31, 2014, we repurchased $684 million of our common shares. Our Board of Directors has approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, which expires on December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2014, we had $1.0 billion remaining under our repurchase authorization.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2014.Contractual ObligationsExcept for the registered debt offering and debt redemption described above under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and in Note 6 of the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements”, as of December 31, 2014 there have been no other material changes, outside of the ordinary course of business, in our outstanding contractual obligations disclosed in our 2014 Form 10-K.At December 31, 2014, our long-term debt and short-term borrowings and interest on long-term debt for the remainder of fiscal 2015 and fiscal periods thereafter are as follows:(in millions)2015 2016 to2017 2018 to2019 There-after TotalLong-term debt and short-term borrowings (1)$270 $311 $403 $2,992 $3,976Interest on long-term debt70 262 226 1,042 1,600Total long-term and short-term obligations$340 $573 $629 $4,034 $5,576  (1)Represents maturities of our long-term debt obligations and other short-term borrowings.

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates since the end of fiscal 2014 through December 31, 2014.20Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThere have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative market risks since the end of fiscal 2014 through December 31, 2014 from those reported in our 2014 Form 10-K.Item 4: Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) as of December 31, 2014. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2014, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.21Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesPart II. Other InformationItem 1: Legal ProceedingsIn addition to the proceedings described below, the legal proceedings described in Note 8 of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" are incorporated in this "Item 1: Legal Proceedings" by reference. On January 23, 2015, Erste-Sparinvest Kapitalanlagegesellschaft m.b.H., a purported shareholder, filed a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the current and certain former members of our Board of Directors alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to implement and maintain a system to prevent diversion of controlled substances in connection with, among other things, the DEA’s past suspensions of our distribution centers’ registrations. The derivative complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified money damages against the defendants and an award of attorney's fees. This same plaintiff had made demand on our Board of Directors in May 2014 to take action against current and certain former directors based on allegations similar to those made in the derivative complaint. A special committee of independent directors investigated the allegations made in the demand, and after receiving and evaluating the special committee's findings and recommendations with respect to the demand, our Board of Directors determined in November 2014 that pursuing the claims set forth in the demand was not in the best interest of the company. In the derivative complaint, the plaintiff also alleges that the Board of Directors wrongfully rejected the demand.Item 1A: Risk FactorsYou should carefully consider the information in this Form 10-Q and the risk factors discussed in "Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors" and other risks discussed in our 2014 Form 10-K and our filings with the SEC since June 30, 2014. These risks could materially  and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. Our business also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations.Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
