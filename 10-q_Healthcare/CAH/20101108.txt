Item 1A: Risk Factors  The risk factors in our 2010 Form 10-K include a risk factor titled “We may not be able to capture the full benefits from our minority investment in CareFusion” under the heading “Risks associated with the Spin-Off of CareFusion”. Because we disposed of our remaining shares of CareFusion stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2010, this risk factor is no longer applicable.  The risks described in our 2010 Form 10-K and in this Form 10-Q are not the only risks that we face. You should carefully consider the information in this Form 10-Q and the risk factors and other risks discussed in our 2010 Form 10-K and our filings with the SEC since June 30, 2010. These risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows. Our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations.    26    Table of Contents     Item 2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
