Item 1A: Risk Factors  The risk factors in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 (the “2009 Form 10-K”) included risks that were specific to CareFusion. The Company completed the Spin-Off of CareFusion on August 31, 2009 and as such the risk factors in the 2009 Form 10-K were superseded by the risk factors set forth in “Part II, Item 1A—Risk Factors” of the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 (the “September 30, 2009 Form 10-Q”). In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in “Part II, Item 1A—Risk Factors” in the September 30, 2009 Form 10-Q, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and/or future business prospects. The risks described in the September 30, 2009 Form 10-Q and in this Form 10-Q are not the only risks that the Company faces. The information in this Form 10-Q and the risks described in the September 30, 2009 Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the 2009 Form 10-K and the Company’s filings with the SEC since June 30, 2009. The Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and/or future business prospects could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not known to the Company at the time of the filing of this Form 10-Q or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial.
