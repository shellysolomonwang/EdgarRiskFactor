Item 1A: Risk Factors" of this Form 10-Q, Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-Q and "Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors" of our 2013 Form 10-K. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.OverviewWe are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories, physician offices and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs, enhancing efficiency and improving quality. We also provide medical products to patients in the home. We report our financial results in two segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical.Revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2013 was $22.2 billion and $46.8 billion, a 12 percent and 9 percent decrease, respectively, from the prior-year periods largely due to the previously disclosed expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreen Co. ("Walgreens") on August 31, 2013. Gross margin increased 10 percent to $1.3 billion and 9 percent to $2.6 billion for the three and six months ended December 31, 2013, respectively, reflecting the positive impact of acquisitions, margin rate expansion and sales growth from new and existing pharmaceutical distribution customers, partially offset by the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens.Operating earnings increased 2 percent to $519 million and 3 percent to $990 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2013, respectively. Both periods were impacted by the factors discussed above as well as an increase in distribution, selling, general and administrative expenses and intangible asset amortization related to the acquisition of AssuraMed, Inc. ("AssuraMed").Earnings from continuing operations were down 9 percent to $275 million and up 7 percent to $614 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2013, respectively. Both periods were impacted by the factors discussed above and a tax charge ($56 million) due to proposed  assessments of additional tax. The six months ended December 31, 2013 also included a $63 million favorable impact from the settlement of federal and state tax controversies during the first quarter of fiscal 2014.Our cash and equivalents balance was $2.7 billion at December 31, 2013, compared to $1.9 billion at June 30, 2013. The increase in cash and equivalents during the six months ended December 31, 2013 was driven by net cash provided by operating activities of $988 million, which includes the decrease in our net working capital associated with the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens. We plan to continue to execute a balanced deployment of available capital to position ourselves for sustainable competitive advantage and to enhance shareholder value.Walgreens ContractThe expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens unfavorably impacted period-over-period comparisons of revenue and operating earnings during the three and six months ended December 31, 2013. We expect the contract expiration to have an adverse impact on our period-over-period comparisons of revenue and operating earnings during the remainder of fiscal 2014 and the first quarter of fiscal 2015.CVS ContractsIn December 2013, we announced the signing of an agreement with CVS Caremark Corporation (“CVS”) to form a U.S.-based generic sourcing entity ("Sourcing JV"). Both companies are contributing their sourcing and supply chain expertise to the 50/50 joint venture and are committing to source generic pharmaceuticals through it. The Sourcing JV, which we expect to be operational as soon as July 1, 2014, will have an initial term of 10 years. Under this arrangement, the Sourcing JV will negotiate generic supply contracts on behalf of both companies; however, it will not own products or hold inventory on behalf of either company. The arrangement includes a quarterly payment of $25 million over the term that we will pay to CVS. No physical assets will be contributed by either company to the Sourcing JV, and minimal funding will be provided to capitalize the entity. The venture is subject to the completion of final documentation and customary closing conditions.Also during the three months ended December 31, 2013, we entered into a three-year extension, through June 2019, of our existing pharmaceutical distribution contracts with CVS.AcquisitionsWe did not complete any acquisitions that were significant, individually or in the aggregate, during the six months ended December 31, 2013. In March 2013, we acquired AssuraMed, a provider of medical supplies to homecare providers and patients in the home. This acquisition increased revenue and operating earnings for the three and six months ended December 31, 2013.TrendsWhile pharmaceutical price appreciation on some generic products positively impacted our margins during the first half of fiscal 2014, there is no assurance that this price appreciation will continue in the future.13Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)Results of OperationsRevenue Three Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangePharmaceutical$19,443 $22,747 (15)%Medical2,799 2,487 13 %Total segment revenue22,242 25,234 (12)%Corporate(2) (2) N.M.Total revenue$22,240 $25,232 (12)% Six Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangePharmaceutical$41,256 $46,244 (11)%Medical5,511 4,879 13 %Total segment revenue46,767 51,123 (9)%Corporate(4) (2) N.M.Total revenue$46,763 $51,121 (9)%Pharmaceutical SegmentRevenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior-year periods was negatively impacted by the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens ($5.2 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively). Revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2013 was also negatively impacted by the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Express Scripts, Inc. on September 30, 2012 ($2.0 billion). These decreases were partially offset by sales growth from new and existing pharmaceutical distribution customers ($1.8 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively).Medical SegmentRevenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior-year periods reflects the benefit of acquisitions ($278 million and $547 million, respectively) and increased net volume from existing customers ($48 million and $121 million, respectively).Cost of Products SoldAs a result of the same factors affecting the change in revenue, cost of products sold decreased $3.1 billion (13 percent) and $4.6 billion (9 percent) compared to the prior-year periods. See the gross margin discussion below for additional drivers impacting cost of products sold.Gross Margin Three Months Ended December 31 (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeGross margin$1,345 $1,224 10% Six Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeGross margin$2,608 $2,382 9%Gross margin increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior-year periods, driven by the positive impact of acquisitions ($77 million and $150 million, respectively). The increase in gross margin also reflects margin rate expansion ($51 million and $18 million, respectively), excluding the impact from the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens.  Margin rate expansion for both periods was driven by strong performance from both generic programs and branded agreements, including the impact of price appreciation. Gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2013 was unfavorably impacted by $14 million due to lower sales, which includes the impact from the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens and is partially offset by sales growth from new and existing pharmaceutical distribution customers. Gross margin for the six months ended December 31, 2013 was positively impacted by $51 million due to sales growth from new and existing pharmaceutical distribution customers and is partially offset by the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens.Distribution, Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses Three Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeSG&A expenses$766 $699 10% Six Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeSG&A expenses$1,497 $1,388 8%SG&A expenses increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior-year period primarily due to acquisitions ($37 million and $75 million, respectively).Segment Profit and Consolidated Operating Earnings Three Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangePharmaceutical$482 $441 9%Medical131 94 40%Total segment profit613 535 15%Corporate(94) (29) N.M.Total operating earnings$519 $506 2% Six Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangePharmaceutical$916 $841 9%Medical238 168 41%Total segment profit1,154 1,009 14%Corporate(164) (46) N.M.Total operating earnings$990 $963 3%Pharmaceutical Segment ProfitThe increase in Pharmaceutical segment profit during the three and six months ended December 31, 2013 was due in part to margin rate expansion, excluding the impact from the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens. Margin rate expansion for both periods was driven by strong performance from both generic programs and branded agreements, including the impact of price appreciation. Pharmaceutical segment profit for the three months ended December 31, 2013 was unfavorably impacted by lower sales, which includes the impact from the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens and is partially offset by sales growth from new and existing pharmaceutical distribution customers. Pharmaceutical segment profit for the six months ended December 31, 2013 was also positively impacted 14Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)by sales growth from new and existing pharmaceutical distribution customers and is partially offset by the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens.Medical Segment ProfitThe principal driver for the increase in Medical segment profit during the three and six months ended December 31, 2013 was the positive impact of acquisitions.Consolidated Operating EarningsIn addition to revenue, gross margin and SG&A expenses discussed above, operating earnings were impacted by the following: Three Months Ended December 31(in millions)2013 2012Restructuring and employee severance$10 $1Amortization and other acquisition-related costs56 25Impairments and loss on disposal of assets9 5Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net(15) (12) Six Months Ended December 31(in millions)2013 2012Restructuring and employee severance$20 $6Amortization and other acquisition-related costs105 53Impairments and loss on disposal of assets9 6Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net(13) (34)Restructuring and Employee SeveranceOn January 30, 2013, we announced a restructuring plan within our Medical segment. Under this restructuring plan, among other things, we are moving production of procedure kits from our facility in Waukegan, Illinois to other facilities and selling property and consolidating office space in Waukegan, Illinois. We recognized restructuring costs of $6 million and $12 million related to this restructuring plan during the three and six months ended December 31, 2013, respectively, which primarily consisted of facility exit and other costs.We currently estimate the total costs associated with this restructuring plan to be approximately $77 million on a pre-tax basis, of which $51 million was recognized in fiscal 2013 and $20 million was recognized during the six months ended December 31, 2013, including the write-down of the property in Waukegan, Illinois as discussed below. The estimated $6 million remaining costs to be recognized through the end of fiscal 2014 consist of facility exit and other costs.Amortization and Other Acquisition-Related CostsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $46 million and $22 million for the three months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $91 million and $43 million for the six months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in amortization during the three and six months ended December 31, 2013 was primarily due to intangible assets from the acquisition of AssuraMed.Impairments and Loss on Disposal of AssetsIn connection with our Medical segment restructuring plan, during the three months ended December 31, 2013, we recognized an $8 million loss to write down property in Waukegan, Illinois to the estimated fair value, less costs to sell. Litigation (Recoveries)/Charges, NetWe recognized income resulting from settlements of class action antitrust claims in which we were a class member of $16 million and $12 million during the three months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $16 million and $34 million during the six months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Earnings Before Income Taxes and Discontinued OperationsIn addition to the items discussed above, earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following: Three Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeOther income, net$(6) $(4) N.M.Interest expense, net33 27 23% Six Months Ended December 31  (in millions)2013 2012 ChangeOther income, net$(10) $(12) N.M.Interest expense, net66 53 25%Interest Expense, NetThe increase in interest expense, net for the three and six months ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior-year period was primarily due to $1.3 billion of notes issued in connection with the AssuraMed acquisition during the third quarter of fiscal 2013.Provision for Income TaxesGenerally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and U.S. state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items.During the three months ended December 31, 2013, the effective tax rate of 44.1 percent was impacted by net unfavorable discrete items of $38 million, which increased the rate by 7.7 percentage points. The discrete items include the unfavorable impact of remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits ($56 million) as a result of proposed assessments of additional tax.During the six months ended December 31, 2013, the effective tax rate of 34.2 percent was impacted by net favorable discrete items of $23 million, which reduced the rate by 2.4 percentage points. The discrete items include the favorable impact of the settlement of federal and state tax controversies ($67 million) and the unfavorable impact of remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits ($56 million).During the three and six months ended December 31, 2012, the effective tax rate of 37.2 percent and 37.6 percent was impacted by net unfavorable discrete items of $2 million and $6 million, which increased the rate by 0.3 and 0.6 percentage points, respectively.Ongoing AuditsDuring the six months ended December 31, 2013, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") closed audits of fiscal years 2003 through 2005. The IRS is currently conducting audits of fiscal years 2006 through 2010.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe currently believe that, based upon available capital resources (cash on hand and access to committed credit facilities) and projected operating 15Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesFinancial Review (continued)cash flow, we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs; currently anticipated capital expenditures, business growth and expansion; contractual obligations; payments for tax settlements; and current and projected debt service requirements, dividends and share repurchases. If we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions, depending on the size and timing of such transactions, we may need to access capital in addition to cash on hand and our existing committed credit facilities.Cash and EquivalentsOur cash and equivalents balance was $2.7 billion at December 31, 2013, compared to $1.9 billion at June 30, 2013. At December 31, 2013, our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments. The increase in cash and equivalents during the six months ended December 31, 2013 was driven by net cash provided by operating activities of $988 million, offset by dividends of $208 million. Net cash provided by operating activities of $988 million includes the impact of the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens, which resulted in a significant net working capital decrease. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by other changes in working capital, including the timing of inventory purchases.We use days sales outstanding (“DSO”), days inventory on hand (“DIOH”) and days payable outstanding (“DPO”) to evaluate our working capital performance. December 31 2013 2012Days sales outstanding19.7 22.0Days inventory on hand (1)29.7 27.0Days payable outstanding (1)39.3 37.8(1)Chargeback billings, which are used in the above calculations, were $4.8 billion and $4.1 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as customer payments of accounts receivable, the timing of inventory purchases and payments to vendors in the regular course of business. The changes in DSO and DPO are primarily a result of the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens. DIOH increased primarily as a result of the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens and the timing of inventory purchases.The cash and equivalents balance at December 31, 2013 included $446 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation, permanently bringing the money into the United States could trigger U.S. federal, state and local income tax obligations. As a U.S. parent company, we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to U.S. federal income tax through intercompany loans.Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperOn October 15, 2013, we reduced our committed receivables sales facility program from $950 million to $700 million in light of the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens. In addition to our committed receivables sales facility, our sources of liquidity include a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion, backed by the revolving credit facility. We had no outstanding balance under the committed receivables sales facility program and no outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program at December 31, 2013. We also had no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2013, except for $42 million of standby letters of credit. Our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility program require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio, as of any fiscal quarter end, of at least 4-to-1 and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.25-to-1. As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures were $90 million and $62 million during the six months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.DividendsOn November 6, 2013, our Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.3025 per share, or $1.21 on an annualized basis, which was paid on January 15, 2014 to shareholders of record on January 2, 2014.On February 5, 2014, our Board of Directors approved our 118th consecutive regular quarterly dividend, payable to shareholders of record on April 1, 2014.Share RepurchasesDuring the six months ended December 31, 2013, we repurchased $50 million of our common shares. We funded the repurchases with cash on hand. On October 29, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which expires on December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2013, we had $1.35 billion remaining under our current repurchase authorization, of which $350 million expires on August 31, 2015 and the remainder expires on December 31, 2016. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2013.Contractual ObligationsOther than our agreement with CVS to form the Sourcing JV, there has been no material change in our outstanding contractual obligations since the end of fiscal 2013 through December 31, 2013.Recent Financial Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 of the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards.Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting EstimatesRefer to the Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates section of "Part II, Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2013 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates since the end of fiscal 2013 through December 31, 2013.16Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThere have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative market risks since the end of fiscal 2013 through December 31, 2013 from those reported in our 2013 Form 10-K.Item 4: Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) as of December 31, 2013. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2013 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.17Table of Contents Cardinal Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesPart II. Other InformationItem 1: Legal ProceedingsIn addition to the proceedings described below, the legal proceedings described in Note 6 of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" are incorporated in this "Item 1: Legal Proceedings" by reference.In June 2012, Henry Stanley, Jr., a purported shareholder, filed a derivative action on behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (the "federal action") against the current and certain former members of our Board of Directors. A similar action was filed by Daniel Himmel, a purported shareholder, in the Common Pleas Court of Delaware County, Ohio (the "state action") against the current and certain former members of our Board of Directors and certain of our officers. The complaints alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's suspension of our Lakeland, Florida distribution center's registration to distribute controlled substances in February 2012, and the suspension and reinstatement of such registrations at three of our facilities in 2007 and 2008. The state action also made claims based on corporate waste and unjust enrichment. The complaints sought, among other things, unspecified money damages from the defendants and an award of attorney's fees. In October 2012, the U.S. District Court dismissed the federal action with prejudice, and in August 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the decision. In July 2013, the Common Pleas Court dismissed the state action, and in October 2013, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed an appeal of the court's decision with prejudice. In September 2013, the plaintiff in the federal action made demand on our Board of Directors to take action against current and certain former members of our Board of Directors to recover damages based on the allegations made in the federal action. A special committee of independent directors investigated the allegations made in the demand. After receiving and evaluating the special committee's findings and recommendations, our Board of Directors determined in February 2014 that pursuing the claims set forth in the shareholder demand was not in the best interest of the company.Item 1A: Risk FactorsYou should carefully consider the risk factor below and other information in this Form 10-Q and the risk factors discussed in "Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors" and other risks discussed in our 2013 Form 10-K and our filings with the SEC since June 30, 2013. These risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. Our business also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations.The anticipated benefits of our generic sourcing joint venture with CVS may not be realized. In December 2013, we and CVS signed an agreement to form the Sourcing JV and we agreed to pay CVS $25 million per quarter over 10 years. If we are unable to successfully and timely implement the Sourcing JV or if we do not realize the expected benefits from the Sourcing JV, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
