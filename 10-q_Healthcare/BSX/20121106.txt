ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIn addition to the information set forth below and other information contained elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2011 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K and in "Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Quarterly Report filed on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.We may record future goodwill impairment charges or other intangible asset impairment charges related to one or more of our business or regional reporting units, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations. We test our April 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. As a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of 2012, we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) reporting unit will be slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macro-economic factors, and our performance in the European market. We concluded that the goodwill within the EMEA reporting unit was impaired and recorded a non-cash $3.602 billion ($3.579 billion after-tax) charge in the second quarter of 2012. In the third quarter of 2012, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a non-cash $748 million (pre- and after-tax) estimated charge associated with our U.S. Cardiac Rhythm Management (U.S. CRM) reporting unit, primarily driven by the reduction in the estimated size of the U.S. CRM market, related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors, which led to lower projected U.S. CRM results compared to prior forecasts. The amount of this charge is subject to finalization. We would recognize any necessary adjustment to this estimate in the fourth quarter of 2012, as we finalize the second step of the goodwill impairment test, in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. We continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods. These reporting units include our U.S. CRM reporting unit, which holds $216 million of remaining allocated goodwill; our U.S. Cardiovascular reporting unit, which holds $2.352 billion of allocated goodwill; and our U.S. Neuromodulation reporting unit, which holds $1.266 billion of allocated goodwill, each as of September 30, 2012. As of September 30, 2012, the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk (with the exception of the U.S. CRM reporting unit, whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value) was approximately 10 to 13 percent. In addition during the third quarter of 2012, in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our U.S. CRM reporting unit, we performed an impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets allocated to our U.S. CRM reporting unit as of September 30, 2012 (approximately $3.347 billion) on an undiscounted cash flow basis, and concluded that these assets were not impaired. However, following the recent declines in our CRM projections, the recoverability of our CRM-related amortizable intangibles ($4.684 billion globally) are sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and CRM business performance. The $4.684 billion of CRM-related amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods. An impairment of a material portion of our CRM-related amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value for our reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill. We also monitor quarterly for events or other potential indicators of impairment that would warrant an interim impairment test of our intangible assets. For each of these assets, relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions, including increases to the carrying values, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.76Table of ContentsITEM 2.
