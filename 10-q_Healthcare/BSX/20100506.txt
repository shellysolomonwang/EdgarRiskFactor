ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  In addition to the information set forth below and other information contained in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.  We face various risks and uncertainties as a result of our recent ship-hold and removal of field inventory of all ICD and CRT-D systems offered by our CRM division in the United States, including harm to our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.  On March 15, 2010, we announced the ship-hold and removal of field inventory of all ICD and CRT-D systems offered by our CRM division in the United States, after determining that two instances of changes in the manufacturing process related to these products were not submitted for approval to the FDA. We have since submitted the required documentation and, on April 15, 2010, we received clearance from the FDA for the two manufacturing changes and resumed distribution of our COGNIS® CRT-D systems and TELIGEN® ICD systems. We undertook an internal review of manufacturing and other changes related to earlier generations of these products, as well as the associated regulatory submissions. The review identified a few additional instances in which we had not submitted the appropriate documentation for certain manufacturing changes related to these products. We are working closely with the FDA to secure the necessary clearances to allow us to return these products to market in the United States as soon as possible. In addition to the internal review we conducted, we are working to ensure tighter controls over our change order and regulatory filing systems. We are also working to seek to restore trust and recapture market share lost during the quarter. However, as a result of the ship-hold and product removal actions, we face various risks and uncertainties, including the following:       •   we have suffered and may continue to suffer loss of market share for these products in the United States, which we may be unable to minimize or recapture, or to offset with the release of future products;        •   we may not be able to regain the trust of the implanting physician and patient community and may suffer on-going harm to our reputation;        •   we may have difficulty retaining and attracting key members of our CRM sales force;        •   we may have additional non-cash charges as a result of impairment of our goodwill balance; and        •   there may be a negative impact on new product launch schedules and product launches in new geographies as a result of the diversion of management and employee attention.
