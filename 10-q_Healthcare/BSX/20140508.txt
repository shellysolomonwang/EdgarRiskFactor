Risk Factors” in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the specific risk factors discussed below and in connection with forward-looking statements throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which could cause actual results to vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements.

We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions.Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing and distribution operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $4.893 billion as of March 31, 2014 and $4.516 billion as of December 31, 2013. We recorded $215 million of other assets and $56 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of March 31, 2014, as compared to $264 million of other assets and $55 million of other liabilities as of December 31, 2013. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $262 million as of March 31, 2014 and $257 million as of December 31, 2013. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $320 million as of March 31, 2014 and by $314 million as of December 31, 2013. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction, resulting in minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operations.Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of $450 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 to convert fixed-rate debt associated with certain of our senior notes into floating-rate debt. As of March 31, 2014, we recorded $6 million of other assets to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2013, we recorded $1 million of other assets and $8 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments. A one-percentage point increase in interest rates would have decreased the derivative instruments’ fair value by $37 million as of March 31, 2014, and by $41 million as of December 31, 2013. A one-percentage point decrease in interest rates would have increased the derivative instruments’ fair value by $41 million as of March 31, 2014, and by $37 million as of December 31, 2013. As of March 31, 2014, $3.392 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates, representing approximately 80 percent of our total debt.  50Table of ContentsSee Note E – Fair Value Measurements to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding our derivative financial instruments.ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2014 pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).
