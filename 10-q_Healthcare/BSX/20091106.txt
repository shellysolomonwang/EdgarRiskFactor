ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  In addition to the information set forth below and other information contained in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in “Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our June 30, 2009 Quarterly Report filed on Form 10-Q and “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.  Heightened regulatory enforcement may adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products.  Heightened regulatory enforcement arising from changes in the political and regulatory environment as well as economic pressures may adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and to maintain for sale products previously approved. The FDA’s enhanced reporting requirements and ability to analyze reported data may result in more frequent field actions which may include communications to physicians and patients, recall of product from the field and repair or replacement of devices. One or more of these field actions could have a material impact on our net sales, cash flow and reputation in the marketplace.  73    Table of Contents     ITEM 6. EXHIBITS
