ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  In addition to the risk factors set forth below and the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in “Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our June 30, 2008 and March 31, 2008 Quarterly Reports filed on Form 10-Q and “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2007 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.   Recent deterioration in the economy and credit markets may adversely affect our future results of operations.  Recently, the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States federal government. While the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company and our ability to borrow money in the credit markets and potentially to draw on our revolving credit facility or otherwise. Similarly, our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our products or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis, if at all.  Our share price will fluctuate.  Stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility over the past year. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to variability in the prevailing sentiment regarding our operations or business prospects, as well as potential further sales of our common stock due to margin calls on loans secured by pledges of our common stock.
