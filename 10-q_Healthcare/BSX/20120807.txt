ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIn addition to the information set forth below and other information contained elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2011 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.We may record future goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations. We test our April 1 goodwill balances for impairment during the second quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. As a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of 2012, we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) reporting unit will be slightly lower than our previous estimates due to our performance in, and worsening of the macro-economic factors affecting, the European market. We concluded that the goodwill within the EMEA reporting unit was impaired and recorded an estimated charge of $3.602 billion ($3.579 billion after-tax) in the second quarter of 2012. The amount of this charge is subject to finalization. We would recognize any necessary adjustment to this estimate in the third quarter of 2012, as we finalize the second step of the goodwill impairment test. We continue to identify three reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the impairment test in future reporting periods. These reporting units include our U.S. CRM reporting unit, our U.S. Cardiovascular reporting unit, and our U.S. Neuromodulation reporting unit, which together hold approximately $4.7 billion of allocated goodwill. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test. For each of these reporting units, relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit relative to our expectations or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of future goodwill impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.70Table of ContentsITEM 2.
