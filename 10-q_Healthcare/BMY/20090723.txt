QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  For a discussion of the Company’s market risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in the Company’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  In June 2009, the Company repurchased approximately $63 million principal amount of its 5.875% Notes due 2036 for a premium of $4 million. The total gain attributed to this transaction amounted to $11 million, which also included the termination of approximately $35 million notional amount of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps for proceeds of $5 million.  In June 2009, the Company executed several fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to convert $200 million of its 5.45% Notes due 2018 from fixed rate debt to variable rate debt.  In April 2009, the Company executed several fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to convert $597 million of its 5.25% Notes due 2013 from fixed rate debt to variable rate debt.  In January 2009, the Company terminated $1,061 million notional amount of fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements for proceeds of $187 million. The basis adjustment on the debt, which was equal to the proceeds from this swap termination, is being recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt.  In the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, the Company sold $623 million and $723 million notional amount of forward contracts (in several currencies), respectively, to partially hedge the exchange impact primarily related to forecasted intercompany inventory purchases for up to the next 17 months.
