Item 1A. Risk Factors.”  Product and Pipeline Developments  We manage our research and development (R&D) programs on a portfolio basis, investing resources in each stage from early discovery through late-stage development. We continually evaluate our portfolio of R&D assets to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support future growth. We consider our R&D programs that have entered into Phase III development to be significant, as these programs constitute our late-stage development pipeline. These Phase III development programs include both investigational compounds in Phase III development for initial indications and marketed products that are in Phase III development for additional indications or formulations. Spending on these programs represents approximately 30-40% of our annual R&D expenses. No individual investigational compound or marketed product represented 10% or more of our R&D expenses in any of the last three years. While we do not expect all of our late-stage development programs to make it to market, our late-stage development programs are the R&D programs that could potentially have an impact on our revenue and earnings within the next few years. The following are the recent significant developments in our marketed products and our late-stage pipeline:  YERVOY – a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with unresectable (inoperable) or metastatic melanoma, which currently is also being studied for other indications including lung cancer as well as adjuvant melanoma and hormone-refractory prostate cancer         •    In March 2011, the FDA approved YERVOY for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed or previously-treated unresectable (inoperable) or metastatic melanoma.         •    In March 2011, the Company announced that the Phase III clinical trial, known as study 024, met its primary endpoint of improving overall survival in previously-untreated patients with metastatic melanoma. Study 024 was designed to assess overall survival in unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma patients who have not received prior therapy. The study compares YERVOY 10 mg/kg in combination with chemotherapy (dacarbazine) vs. chemotherapy alone. An abstract of the 024 data has been submitted to the American Society of Clinical Oncology for potential presentation at the Annual Meeting in June of this year.    29    Table of Contents ELIQUIS* (apixaban) – an oral Factor Xa inhibitor in development for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolic disorders and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation that is part of our strategic alliance with Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer)         •    In March 2011, the Company received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for ELIQUIS* for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events in adult patients who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery. The CHMP’s positive opinion will now be reviewed by the European Commission which has the authority to approve medicines for the European Union (EU).         •    Based upon discussions with the FDA and in agreement with Pfizer, we expect to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) filing in the U.S. including data from both the AVERROES trial and the ARISTOTLE trial, assuming a positive outcome in the ARISTOTLE study, for an indication in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF), which will cover the broadest spectrum of patients in one single filing. We expect to have the initial top line results from the ARISTOTLE data in the second quarter of 2011 and submit regulatory filings in the U.S. and Europe either in the third or fourth quarter of 2011.         •    In February 2011, the Company and Pfizer published the full results of the AVERROES study of ELIQUIS* in The New England Journal of Medicine. The study demonstrated that, for patients with AF who were expected or demonstrated to be unsuitable for a vitamin K antagonist therapy such as warfarin, ELIQUIS* was statistically superior to aspirin in reducing the composite of stroke or systemic embolism, without a significant increase in major bleeding, fatal bleeding or intracranial bleeding. There were no significant differences in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke between ELIQUIS* and aspirin. The study results also showed that ELIQUIS* demonstrated superiority for its secondary efficacy endpoint in reducing the composite of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction or vascular death for patients with AF when compared with aspirin.  NULOJIX (belatacept) – a fusion protein with novel immunosuppressive activity targeted at prevention of solid organ transplant rejection         •    In April 2011, the Company received a positive opinion from the CHMP recommending approval of NULOJIX in combination with corticosteroids and mycophenolic acid (MPA), for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adults receiving a renal transplant. The CHMP’s positive opinion will now be reviewed by the European Commission.  Dapagliflozin – an oral SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of diabetes that is part of our strategic alliance with AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca)         •    In March 2011, the Company and AstraZeneca announced that the FDA has accepted for review the NDA for dapagliflozin. A Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for dapagliflozin has also been validated by the EMA. The NDA and MAA submissions for dapagliflozin were filed in December 2010. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for the FDA is October 28, 2011.  PLAVIX* – a platelet aggregation inhibitor that is part of our alliance with sanofi         •    In January 2011, the Company and sanofi announced that the FDA has granted the companies an additional six-month period of exclusivity to market PLAVIX*. Exclusivity for PLAVIX* in the U.S. is now scheduled to expire on May 17, 2012.  BARACLUDE (entecavir) – an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B         •    In March 2011, the European Commission approved BARACLUDE for the treatment of hepatitis B in adult patients with decompensated liver disease.  ABILIFY* (aripiprazole) – an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania disorder and major depressive disorder that is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Otsuka)         •    In February 2011, the Company and Otsuka announced that the FDA approved ABILIFY* as an adjunct to the mood stabilizers lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of Bipolar I Disorder. European approval for this use was received in January 2011.    30    Table of Contents REYATAZ (atazanavir sulfate) – a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV         •    In February 2011, the FDA approved an update to the labeling for REYATAZ to include dose recommendations in HIV-infected pregnant women. In HIV combination therapy, treatment with the recommended adult dose of REYATAZ 300 mg, boosted with 100 mg of ritonavir, achieved minimum plasma concentrations (24 hours post-dose) during the third trimester of pregnancy comparable to that observed historically in HIV-infected adults. During the post partum period, atazanavir concentrations may be increased; therefore, while no dose adjustment is necessary, patients should be monitored for two months after delivery.  ONGLYZA/KOMBIGLYZE (saxagliptin/saxagliptin and metformin) – a treatment for type 2 diabetes that is part of our strategic alliance with AstraZeneca         •    In February 2011, the Company and AstraZeneca announced that the European Commission approved a label update for ONGLYZA in the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes who have moderate or severe renal impairment making ONGLYZA the first dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDP-4) inhibitor in Europe available for type 2 diabetes patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.         •    In February 2011, the Company and AstraZeneca announced that the FDA approved the inclusion of data from two clinical studies in an update to the ONGLYZA U.S. Prescribing Information for adults with type 2 diabetes. The U.S. label update provides further evidence regarding use in renally impaired adults with type 2 diabetes as well as comparisons between glipizide and ONGLYZA in patients also taking metformin.  Necitumumab (IMC-11F8) – an investigational anti-cancer agent, which is part of our strategic alliance with Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly)         •    In February 2011, the Company and Lilly announced that enrollment was stopped in the Phase III INSPIRE study of necitumumab as a first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The trial is evaluating the addition of necitumumab to a combination of ALIMTA* (pemetrexed for injection) and cisplatin. The decision to stop enrollment followed an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommendation that no new or recently enrolled patients continue treatment in the trial because of safety concerns related to thromboembolism in the experimental arm of the study. The DMC also noted that patients who have already received two or more cycles of necitumumab appear to have a lower ongoing risk for these safety concerns. These patients may choose to remain on the trial, after being informed of the additional potential risks. Investigators will continue to assess patients after two cycles to determine if there is a potential benefit from treatment. Necitumumab continues to be studied in another Phase III trial named SQUIRE. This study is evaluating necitumumab as a potential treatment for a different type of lung cancer called squamous non-small cell lung cancer in combination with GEMZAR* (gemcitabine HCl for injection) and cisplatin. The same independent DMC recommended that this trial continue because no safety concerns have been observed.  THREE MONTHS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Our results of operations were as follows:                      Three Months Ended March 31,   Dollars in Millions   2011     2010     % Change   Net Sales   $ 5,011     $ 4,807     4%   Total Expenses   $ 3,244     $ 3,355     (3)%   Earnings before Income Taxes   $ 1,767     $ 1,452     22%   % of net sales     35.3 %      30.2 %       Provision for Income Taxes   $ 400     $ 351     14%   Effective tax rate     22.6 %      24.2 %       Net Earnings   $ 1,367     $ 1,101     24%   % of net sales     27.3 %      22.9 %       Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest   $ 381     $ 358     6%   % of net sales     7.6 %      7.4 %       Attributable to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company   $ 986     $ 743     33%   % of net sales     19.7 %      15.5 %       31    Table of Contents Net Sales  The composition of the change in net sales was as follows:                                          Three Months Ended March 31,   2011 vs. 2010      Net Sales   Analysis of % Change   Dollars in Millions   2011   2010   Total Change   Volume   Price   Foreign Exchange   U.S.     $ 3,250       $ 3,089         5 %       (1 )%       6 %       —     Non-U.S.       1,761         1,718         3 %       5 %       (4 )%       2 %                                                     Total     $ 5,011       $ 4,807         4 %       1 %       2 %       1 %                                                   Our global sales growth in the first quarter of 2011 was led by PLAVIX*, recently launched ONGLYZA/KOMBIGLYZE, BARACLUDE, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA.  U.S. Net Sales  The change in net sales attributed to price was a result of higher average net selling prices for PLAVIX* partially offset by:         •    The reduction in our contractual share of ABILIFY* net sales; and         •    The expansion of Medicaid rebates to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans.  The change in net sales attributed to volume reflects:         •    Reduced PLAVIX* prescription demand;         •    The AVALIDE* (irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide) supply shortage from previously reported recalls and a temporary delay in restocking inventory; partially offset by         •    Increased volume of certain key products including ONGLYZA/KOMBIGLYZE and SPRYCEL.  International Net Sales  The change in net sales attributed to price was impacted by continuing fiscal challenges in European countries as healthcare payers, including government agencies, have reduced and are expected to continue to reduce the cost of healthcare through actions that directly or indirectly impose additional price reductions. These measures include, but are not limited to, mandatory discounts, rebates and other price reductions.  The change in net sales attributed to volume reflects:         •    Increased demand of BARACLUDE and most other key products; partially offset by         •    Decreased sales of mature brands attributed to divestitures and generic competition.  The change in net sales attributed to foreign exchange was due to a weakening U.S. dollar against the Yen and other currencies, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, when compared to the prior period.  In general, our business is not seasonal. For information on U.S. pharmaceutical prescriber demand, reference is made to the table within “—Estimated End-User Demand” below, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of our key products. U.S. and non-U.S. net sales are categorized based upon the location of the customer.    32    Table of Contents We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported in the consolidated statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross-to-net sales adjustments. The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments was as follows:                    Three Months Ended March 31,     Dollars in Millions   2011     2010     Gross Sales   $ 5,599     $ 5,285     Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments             Charge-Backs Related to Government Programs     (167 )      (136 )    Cash Discounts     (67 )      (66 )    Managed Healthcare Rebates and Other Contract Discounts     (120 )      (115 )    Medicaid Rebates     (135 )      (96 )    Sales Returns     (23 )      1     Other Adjustments     (76 )      (66 )                      Total Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments     (588 )      (478 )                      Net Sales   $ 5,011     $ 4,807                     The activities and ending balances of each significant category of gross-to-net sales reserve adjustments were as follows:                                     Dollars in Millions   Charge-BacksRelated toGovernmentPrograms     CashDiscounts     ManagedHealthcareRebates andOther ContractDiscounts     MedicaidRebates     SalesReturns     OtherAdjustments     Total     Balance at January 1, 2011   $ 48     $ 29     $ 216     $ 327     $ 187     $ 127     $ 934     Provision related to sales made in current period     167       67       120       135       28       78       595     Provision related to sales made in prior periods     —       —       —       —       (5 )      (2 )      (7 )    Returns and payments     (170 )      (70 )      (112 )      (103 )      (16 )      (52 )      (523 )    Impact of foreign currency translation     (1 )      —       1       —       1       5       6                                                               Balance at March 31, 2011   $ 44     $ 26     $ 225     $ 359     $ 195     $ 156     $ 1,005                                                             Gross-to-net sales adjustments as a percentage of gross sales were 11% in 2011 and 9% in 2010 and are primarily a function of changes in sales mix and contractual and legislative discounts and rebates. Gross-to-net sales adjustments increased due to:         •    Charge-backs related to government programs increased due to U.S. sales growth associated with price increases, additional rebates required in certain European countries attributable to government austerity measures and additional accruals associated with the expansion of the Public Health Service 340B program to certain critical access hospitals, cancer hospitals and other covered entities.         •    Medicaid rebates increased due to the expansion of Medicaid rebates to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans and higher average selling prices of PLAVIX* and REYATAZ.         •    Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts include the impact of the Medicare Part D coverage gap, which was not significant in the first quarter but is expected to increase significantly in the second half of 2011.         •    Sales returns include the expected returns attributable to the loss of patent exclusivity of AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Canada in the first quarter of 2011. We have established reserves for estimated returns in connection with a recall of certain lots of AVALIDE*. Adjustments to these reserves might be required in the future based on actual returns.         •    Other adjustments increased overall due to additional rebates required for certain products sold in Europe attributed to government austerity measures and increased rebates for coupon programs.    33    Table of Contents Net sales of key products represent 85% and 83% of total net sales in the first quarter of 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased 4%.         •    International net sales continue to be negatively impacted by the launch of generic clopidogrel products in the EU. This has a negative impact on both our net sales as it relates to our EU sales in comarketing countries and our equity in net income of affiliates as it relates to our share of sales from our partnership with sanofi in Europe and Asia. We expect continued erosion of PLAVIX* net sales in the EU, which will impact both our international net sales and our equity in net income of affiliates.         •    See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 14. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies—PLAVIX* Litigation,” for further discussion on PLAVIX* exclusivity litigation in both the U.S. and EU.  AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (known in the EU as APROVEL*/KARVEA*) — an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy that is also part of the sanofi alliance         •    U.S. net sales decreased primarily due to a supply shortage of AVALIDE*, resulting from the previously reported recalls and a temporary delay in restocking inventory. Supply to the markets for two of the three recalled dosage forms was restarted in late February. Total estimated U.S. prescription demand decreased 32% partially offset by higher average net selling prices.         •    International net sales increased due to foreign exchange.  ABILIFY* — an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania disorder and major depressive disorder that is part of the Company’s strategic alliance with Otsuka         •    U.S. net sales decreased primarily due to the reduction in our contractual share of net sales recognized from 58% to 53.5%. The decrease was partially offset by higher average net selling prices and increased overall demand. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 5%.         •    International net sales increased primarily due to higher prescription demand.  REYATAZ — a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV         •    U.S. net sales decreased due to wholesaler buying patterns. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 1%.         •    International net sales decreased due to lower demand across most international markets.  SUSTIVA Franchise — a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, which includes SUSTIVA (efavirenz), an antiretroviral drug, and bulk efavirenz, which is also included in the combination therapy, ATRIPLA* (efavirenz 600mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), a product sold through a joint venture with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead)         •    U.S. net sales remained flat. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 8% offset by wholesaler buying patterns.         •    International net sales increased primarily due to continued demand in the EU.  BARACLUDE — an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B         •    Worldwide net sales increased primarily due to continued strong demand in international markets.  ERBITUX* — a monoclonal antibody designed to exclusively target and block the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, which is expressed on the surface of certain cancer cells in multiple tumor types as well as normal cells and is currently indicated for use against colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. ERBITUX* is part of our strategic alliance with Lilly.         •    Net sales remained flat.  SPRYCEL — an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases, for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including GLEEVEC* (imatinib mesylate) and first-line treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. SPRYCEL is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka.         •    U.S. net sales increased due to higher demand attributed to the FDA’s approval of SPRYCEL for first-line treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase in the fourth quarter of 2010 and higher average net selling prices. Estimated total U.S. demand increased 9%.         •    International net sales increased due to higher demand including the impact of the European Commission’s Marketing Authorization of SPRYCEL for first-line treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase in the fourth quarter of 2010.    35    Table of Contents ORENCIA — a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more currently available treatments, such as methotrexate or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy         •    U.S. net sales increased primarily due to higher demand and higher average net selling prices.         •    International net sales increased primarily due to increases in demand.  ONGLYZA/KOMBIGLYZE — a once-daily oral tablet for the treatment of type 2 diabetes         •    ONGLYZA/KOMBIGLYZE increased primarily due to higher overall demand since the launches of ONGLYZA in various countries in the third quarter of 2009 and KOMBIGLYZE beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Mature Products and All Other — includes all other products, including those which have lost exclusivity in major markets and over the counter brands         •    U.S. net sales remained flat in 2011 as the continued generic erosion of certain products was partially offset by higher average net selling prices.         •    International net sales decreased due to continued generic erosion of certain brands including PRAVACHOL (pravastatin sodium), lower average net selling prices in Europe, the year over year impact of the rationalization and divestitures of our non-strategic product portfolio and lower demand for certain over the counter products.  The estimated U.S. prescription change data provided throughout this report includes information only from the retail and mail order channels and does not reflect product demand within other channels such as hospitals, home health care, clinics, federal facilities including VA hospitals, and long-term care, among others. The data is provided by Wolters Kluwer Health (WK), except for SPRYCEL, and based on the Source Prescription Audit which is a product of WK’s own recordkeeping and projection processes. As such, the data is subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling and may include a margin of error.  The change in SPRYCEL demand is calculated based upon tablets sold through retail and mail order channels based upon data obtained from the IMS Health (IMS) National Sales Perspectives Audit, which is a product of IMS’s own recordkeeping and projection processes. As such, the data is subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling and may include a margin of error.  We continuously seek to improve the quality of our estimates of prescription change amounts and ultimate patient/consumer demand by reviewing the calculation methodologies employed, and analyzing internal and third-party data. We expect to continue to review and refine our methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and will monitor the quality of our own and third parties’ data used in such calculations.  We calculated the estimated total U.S. prescription change on a weighted-average basis to reflect the fact that mail order prescriptions include a higher average volume of product supplied per dispensed prescription, compared to retail prescriptions. Mail order prescriptions typically reflect a 90-day prescription whereas retail prescriptions typically reflect a 30-day prescription. The calculation is derived by multiplying mail order prescription data by a factor that approximates three and adding to this the retail prescriptions. We believe that a calculation of estimated total U.S. prescription change based on this weighted-average approach provides a superior estimate of total prescription demand, with respect to the retail and mail order channels. We use this methodology for our internal demand reporting.    36    Table of Contents Estimated End-User Demand  The following table sets forth for each of our key products sold by the U.S. for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year: (i) total U.S. net sales for each period; (ii) change in reported U.S. net sales for each period; (iii) estimated total U.S. prescription change for the retail and mail order channels calculated by us based on third-party data on a weighted-average basis and (iv) months of inventory on hand in the wholesale distribution channel.

Pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Consent Order described in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the U.S. in the direct customer distribution channel. We are obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. There were no U.S. Pharmaceutical products at March 31, 2011 with inventory in excess of one month on hand. The following are international products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand at December 31, 2010:  DAFALGAN, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had approximately 1.4 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to approximately 1.2 months of inventory on hand at September 30, 2010. The increased level of inventory on hand was primarily due to the September launch of new dosages.  TEMPRA, an analgesic product, had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to approximately 0.9 months of inventory on hand at September 30, 2010. The increased level of inventory on hand was due to ordering patterns of distributors in Mexico in December of 2010.  LUFTAL, an antacid product, had approximately 1.3 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to approximately 0.7 months of inventory on hand at September 30, 2010. The increased level of inventory on hand was due to a build-up of inventory following a stock-out in the second quarter of 2010.  PRINCIPEN, an antibiotic product, had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to approximately 1.3 months of inventory on hand at September 30, 2010. The inventory level has decreased as the inventory levels return to normal following the re-enforcement of antibiotic laws in Mexico which require prescriptions for antibiotics.  FERVEX, a cold and flu product, had approximately 6.4 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to approximately 2.3 months of inventory on hand at September 30, 2010. The increased level of inventory on hand was primarily due to the ordering patterns of private pharmacists in France.  VIDEX/VIDEX EC, an antiviral product, had approximately 1.7 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to approximately 1.5 months of inventory on hand at September 30, 2010. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to government purchasing patterns in Brazil.    37    Table of Contents In the U.S., for all products sold exclusively through wholesalers or through distributors, we determined our months on hand estimates using information with respect to inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement of products provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. products, and provided by some of our distributors. Factors that may influence our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their record keeping processes.  For products in the U.S. that are not sold exclusively through wholesalers or distributors and for our business outside of the U.S., we have significantly more direct customers. Limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. In cases where direct customer product level inventory, ultimate patient/consumer demand or out-movement data does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of other methodologies to calculate estimates of such data, including using such factors as historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand for these business units. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, direct customer purchases in light of price increases, new product or product presentation launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. businesses for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 is not available prior to the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand for the current quarter, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  Geographic Areas  In general, our products are available in most countries in the world. Our net sales by geographic areas, based on the location of the customer, were as follows:                                Three Months Ended March 31,        Net Sales     % of Total Net Sales     Dollars in Millions   2011     2010     % Change     2011     2010     United States   $ 3,250     $ 3,089       5%       65%       64%     Europe     868       886       (2)%       17%       18%     Japan, Asia Pacific and Canada     449       371       21%       9%       8%     Latin America, the Middle East and Africa     214       225       (5)%       4%       5%     Emerging Markets     206       203       1%       4%       4%     Other     24       33       (27)%       1%       1%                                            Total   $ 5,011     $ 4,807       4%       100%       100%                                          For a discussion of U.S. net sales variance, see “—Net Sales” above.  Net sales in Europe decreased primarily due to lower net sales of certain mature brands due to divestitures and increased generic competition for PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, partially offset by sales growth for BARACLUDE and other key products. The sales growth of key products was tempered by austerity measures in Europe as discussed in “—Net Sales” above.  Net sales in Japan, Asia Pacific and Canada increased primarily due to higher demand for BARACLUDE, SPRYCEL and all other key products. Net sales benefited from an 8% favorable foreign exchange impact as well as wholesaler build-up of inventory attributed to the ongoing Japanese crisis. These impacts were partially offset by certain mature brands divestitures and generic competition.  No single country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of total net sales during the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and 2010.    38    Table of Contents Expenses                                Three Months Ended March 31,        Expenses     % of Total Net Sales     Dollars in Millions   2011     2010     % Change     2011     2010     Cost of products sold   $ 1,343     $ 1,306       3%       26.8%       27.2%     Marketing, selling and administrative     928       900       3%       18.5%       18.7%     Advertising and product promotion     214       212       1%       4.3%       4.4%     Research and development     935       910       3%       18.7%       18.9%     Provision for restructuring     44       11       **       0.9%       0.2%     Equity in net income of affiliates     (82)       (97)       (15)%       (1.6)%       (2.0)%     Other (income)/expense     (138)       113       **       (2.9)%       2.4%                                            Total Expenses   $ 3,244     $ 3,355       (3)%       64.7%       69.8%                                             **  Change in excess of 200%.  Cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted by favorable foreign exchange, which was partially offset by lower manufacturing efficiencies compared to the prior year.  Marketing, selling and administrative increased primarily due to a $61 million charge in the first quarter of 2011 attributed to our estimated share of the annual pharmaceutical company fee discussed above in “Executive Summary—U.S. Healthcare Reform Legislation” partially offset by a reduction in sales related activities of certain key products to coincide with their respective life cycle.  Research and development spending increased due to a greater amount of upfront, milestone and other licensing payments in the first quarter of 2011. The first quarter of 2011 includes an $88 million payment associated with an amendment of an intellectual property license agreement for YERVOY prior to its FDA approval in 2011 compared to $55 million of milestone payments in the first quarter of 2010 to Allergan, Inc. and PDL BioPharma Inc.  Provision for restructuring increased due to employee termination benefits for certain workforce reductions taken.  Equity in net income of affiliates decreased due to the continued impact of an alternate salt form of clopidogrel and generic clopidogrel competition on international PLAVIX* net sales.

See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 4. Restructuring.”       •    Gain on debt repurchase is attributed to the repurchase of $50 million of debt and the termination of the related interest rate swaps. See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 7. Financial Instruments.”       •    Gain on sale of product lines, businesses and assets primarily related to the sale of certain mature brands.       •    Other income from alliance partners includes income earned from the sanofi partnership and amortization of certain upfront, milestone and other licensing payments related to our alliances. The decrease is attributed to reduced international demand for PLAVIX* which is manufactured by us and sold to sanofi for international distribution.    39    Table of Contents    •    Product liability charges of $26 million were for additional reserves in connection with the breast implant settlement program.

Non-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance which include the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of pharmaceutical products on a global basis and to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting for future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Among the items in GAAP measures but excluded for purposes of determining adjusted earnings and other adjusted measures are: restructuring and other exit costs; accelerated depreciation charges; asset and IPRD impairments; charges and recoveries relating to significant legal proceedings; upfront, milestone and other licensing payments for in-licensing of products that have not achieved regulatory approval, which are immediately expensed; and significant tax events. For a detailed listing of items that are excluded from the non-GAAP earnings, see “—Specified Items” above. Similar charges or gains for some of these items have been recognized in prior periods and it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods.  A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP follows:                                    Three Months Ended March 31, 2011     Three Months Ended March 31, 2010     Dollars in Millions, except per share data   GAAP     SpecifiedItems     Non-GAAP     GAAP     SpecifiedItems     Non-GAAP     Net Earnings Attributable to BMS   $ 986     $ 14     $ 1,000     $ 743     $ 224     $ 967     Earnings attributed to unvested restricted shares     (2 )      —       (2 )      (3 )      —       (3 )                                                      Net Earnings Attributable to BMS used for Diluted EPS Calculation   $ 984     $ 14     $ 998     $ 740     $ 224     $ 964                                                               Average Common Shares Outstanding—Diluted     1,714       —       1,714       1,725       —       1,725             Diluted EPS Attributable to BMS   $ 0.57     $ 0.01     $ 0.58     $ 0.43     $ 0.13     $ 0.56   Income Taxes  The effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes was 22.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to 24.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2010. See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 6. Income Taxes” for further discussion.  Noncontrolling Interest  Noncontrolling interest is primarily related to our partnerships with sanofi for the territory covering the Americas related to PLAVIX* net sales. See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations” for further discussion. The increase in noncontrolling interest corresponds to increased net sales of PLAVIX* in the U.S. A summary of noncontrolling interest is as follows:                    Three Months Ended March 31,     Dollars in Millions   2011     2010     sanofi partnerships   $ 573     $ 520     Other     4       9                       Noncontrolling interest—pre-tax     577       529     Income taxes     196       171                       Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest—net of taxes   $ 381     $ 358                       41    Table of Contents FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Net cash position was as follows:                    March 31,     December 31,     Dollars in Millions   2011     2010     Cash and cash equivalents   $ 3,405     $ 5,033     Marketable securities—current     3,388       2,268     Marketable securities—non-current     3,065       2,681                       Total     9,858       9,982                           Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt     135       117     Long-term debt     5,276       5,328                       Total debt     5,411       5,445                           Net cash position   $ 4,447     $ 4,537                     We maintain a significant level of working capital, which was approximately $6.5 billion at March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. In 2011 and future periods, we expect cash generated by our operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic alliances and acquisitions, milestone payments and dividends paid in the U.S. We do not rely on short-term borrowings to meet our liquidity needs.  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. were approximately $2.4 billion at March 31, 2011 and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010 which is either utilized to fund non-U.S. operations or repatriated back to the U.S. where taxes have been previously provided. Cash repatriations are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes.  Our investment portfolio includes non-current marketable securities which are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors, which may impact our results of operations. Our investment policy places limits on these investments and the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. The policy also requires that investments are only made with highly rated corporate and financial institutions. See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 7. Financial Instruments.”  We continue to monitor the potential impact of the economic conditions in certain European countries and the related impact on prescription trends, pricing discounts, creditworthiness of our customers, and our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our direct customers. Currently, we believe these conditions will not have a material impact on our liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility.  We have a $2.0 billion five year revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders maturing in December 2011, which is extendable with the consent of the lenders. This facility contains customary terms and conditions, including a financial covenant whereby the ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated capital cannot exceed 50% at the end of each quarter. We have been in compliance with this covenant since the inception of this facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility at March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.  As an additional source of liquidity, we sell trade accounts receivables, principally from non-U.S. governments and hospital customers, to third parties. The receivables are sold on a nonrecourse basis and approximated $246 million and $111 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our sales agreements do not allow for recourse in the event of uncollectibility and we do not retain interest to the underlying asset once sold.  Credit Ratings  Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A2 and Prime-1, respectively, and their long-term credit outlook remains on stable outlook. Standard & Poor’s (S&P) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A+ and A-1, respectively, and their long-term credit rating remains on stable outlook. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A+ and F1, respectively, and their long-term credit rating changed in August 2010 from stable to negative outlook. Our credit ratings are considered investment grade. These long-term ratings designate that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. These short-term ratings designate that we have the strongest capacity for timely repayment.    42    Table of Contents Cash Flows  The following is a discussion of cash flow activities:                    Three Months Ended March 31,     Dollars in Millions   2011     2010     Cash flow provided by/(used in):             Operating activities   $ 481     $ 464     Investing activities     (1,437 )      (2,519 )    Financing activities     (692 )      (486 )  Operating Activities  Cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and cash disbursements from all of our activities other than investing activities and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for:         •    Noncontrolling interest;         •    Non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation charges;         •    Gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities such as gains and losses on the sale of product lines and businesses; and         •    Changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations.  The net impact of the changes in operating assets and liabilities aggregated to a net cash outflow of $814 million and $793 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These items included the impact of changes in receivables, inventories, deferred income, accounts payable, income taxes receivable/payable and other operating assets and liabilities which are discussed in more detail below.  The following summarizes certain working capital components expressed as a percentage of trailing twelve months’ net sales:                         Dollars in Millions   March 31,2011     % of TrailingTwelve MonthNet Sales     December 31,2010     % of TrailingTwelve MonthNet Sales     Net trade receivables   $ 2,046       10.4%     $ 1,985       10.2%     Inventories     1,322       6.7%       1,204       6.2%     Accounts payable     (2,036)       (10.3)%       (1,983)       (10.2)%                                 Total   $ 1,332       6.8%     $ 1,206       6.2%                               During the first quarter of 2011, changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash outflow of $814 million which was impacted by:         •    Cash outflows from other operating assets and liabilities ($574 million) primarily related to the payment of the 2010 accrued bonuses net of current period expense ($232 million) and pension funding ($348 million);         •    Cash outflows from receivables ($91 million) primarily attributed to the timing of collections from alliances; and         •    Cash outflows from U.S. and foreign income taxes payable ($70 million) primarily attributed to timing of tax payments.  In the first quarter of 2010, changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash outflow of $793 million which was impacted by:         •    Cash outflows from other operating assets and liabilities ($557 million) primarily related to the payment of the 2009 accrued bonuses net of first quarter 2010 expense ($248 million) and pension funding ($325 million);         •    Cash outflows from receivables ($309 million) primarily attributed to the timing of collections from alliances and increased sales;         •    Cash outflows from U.S. and foreign income taxes payable ($106 million) primarily attributed to timing of tax payments; and         •    Cash inflows from accounts payables ($119 million) primarily attributed to the timing of vendor and alliance payments.    43    Table of Contents Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities was $1,437 million in the first quarter of 2011 and included:         •    Net purchases of marketable securities ($1,476 million);         •    Litigation recoveries ($102 million); and         •    Capital expenditures ($75 million).  Net cash used in investing activities was $2,519 million in the first quarter of 2010 and included:         •    Net purchases of marketable securities ($2,427 million); and         •    Capital expenditures ($129 million).  Financing Activities  Net cash used in financing activities was $692 million in the first quarter of 2011 and included:         •    Dividend payments ($565 million);         •    Debt repurchase ($54 million); and         •    Repurchases of common stock ($148 million); partially offset by         •    Net proceeds from the exercise of stock options ($53 million).  Net cash provided by financing activities was $486 million in the first quarter of 2010 and included:         •    Dividend payments ($551 million); partially offset by         •    Net proceeds from the exercise of stock options ($82 million).  Dividends declared per common share were $0.33 for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and $0.32 for the three months ended March 31, 2010. Dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as “should”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “target”, “may”, “project”, “guidance”, “intend”, “plan”, “believe” and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and projections regarding our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this report and in the 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly under “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement.  Although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.    44    Table of Contents Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  For a discussion of our market risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are effective.  PART II—OTHER INFORMATION  Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  Information pertaining to legal proceedings can be found in “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 14. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies,” to the interim consolidated financial statements, and is incorporated by reference herein.  Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K except for the following:  We have received a warning letter from the FDA and subsequent Form 483 Inspectional Observations and we may not be able to timely and adequately address the manufacturing issues raised by the FDA.  In 2010, we received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding our manufacturing facility in Manati, Puerto Rico. The warning letter focused on certain Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) processes and practices, which the FDA identified during an inspection, that were to be improved or remediated. The FDA reinspected the Manati site in the first quarter of 2011 and issued Form 483 Inspectional Observations. We are working with the FDA to attempt to resolve all of the outstanding issues under the warning letter and subsequent Form 483 Inspectional Observations. If we are unable to timely and adequately improve or remediate the GMP issues identified in the warning letter and Form 483 Inspectional Observations to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA could subject the Company to additional negative consequences including a consent decree, fines and/or a temporary delay in production at the facility for further corrective action. In addition, it is within the FDA’s discretion to delay an approval decision on the pending NULOJIX (belatacept) Biologics License Application (BLA) filing and/or ORENCIA (abatacept) supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) filing for a subcutaneous formulation until these issues are resolved as the manufacturing of these products will be completed at the Manati facility.    45    Table of Contents Item 2.
