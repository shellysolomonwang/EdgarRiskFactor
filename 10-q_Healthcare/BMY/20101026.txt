Item 1A. Risk Factors” for more information.  Product and Pipeline Developments  The Company manages its research and development (R&D) programs on a portfolio basis, investing resources in each stage of research and development from early discovery through late-stage development. The Company continually evaluates its portfolio of R&D assets to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support the future growth of the Company. We consider our R&D programs that have entered into Phase III development to be significant, as these programs constitute our late-stage development pipeline. These Phase III development programs include both investigational compounds in Phase III development for initial indications and marketed products that are in Phase III development for additional indications or formulations. Spending on these programs represents approximately 30-40% of our annual R&D expenses. No individual investigational compound or marketed product represented 10% or more of our R&D expenses in any of the last three years. While we do not expect all of our late-stage development programs to make it to market, our late-stage development programs are the R&D programs that could potentially have an impact on our revenue and earnings within the next few years. The following are the recent significant developments in our marketed products and our late-stage pipeline:  BARACLUDE (entecavir) – an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B        •    In October 2010, the FDA approved the supplemental New Drug Application of BARACLUDE for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adult patients with decompensated liver disease.  ONGLYZA (saxagliptin) – a once-daily oral tablet for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that is part of our strategic alliance with AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca)        •    In July 2010, the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for a fixed dose combination of ONGLYZA and metformin HCL extended-release tablets as a once-daily treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes was validated by the European Medicines Agency.    35    Table of Contents   ORENCIA (abatacept) – a fusion protein indicated for rheumatoid arthritis        •    In July 2010, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved the Japanese New Drug Application for ORENCIA for the treatment of adults with rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to existing treatment.  SPRYCEL (dasatinib) – an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases indicated for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including GLEEVEC* (imatinib meslylate), which is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka).        •    In October 2010, the Company received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for SPRYCEL for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia.        •    In July 2010, the Company submitted for review in Japan the supplemental New Drug Application for SPRYCEL for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia.  Ipilimumab – a monoclonal antibody currently in Phase III development for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. It is also being studied for other indications including lung cancer as well as adjuvant melanoma and hormone-refractory prostate cancer.        •    In August 2010, the FDA accepted for filing and review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for ipilimumab for the treatment of adult patients with advanced melanoma who have been previously treated. The application has been granted a priority review designation by the FDA with a stated action date of December 25, 2010.        •    The FDA’s Oncology Drug Advisory Committee will review the BLA for ipilimumab on December 2, 2010.  ELIQUIS* (apixaban) – an oral Factor Xa inhibitor in Phase III development for the prevention of venous thromboembolic disorders, the treatment of acute coronary syndrome and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation that is part of our strategic alliance with Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer)        •    In August 2010, the positive preliminary data from the AVERROES trial were presented at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Stockholm, Sweden. The preliminary data demonstrated that apixaban significantly reduced the relative risk of a composite stroke or systematic embolism by 54 percent without a significant increase in major bleeding, fatal bleeding and intracranial bleeding compared with aspirin in patients who were expected or demonstrated to be unsuitable for warfarin treatment. Minor bleeding was significantly increased.        •    After evaluating the preliminary data from the AVERROES trial, and after discussions with the FDA about the atrial fibrillation registrational program for apixaban, we and our alliance partner Pfizer have submitted the first module of an NDA in the U.S. for apixaban for an indication in the AVERROES patient population. The FDA has agreed to accept this NDA on a rolling basis. We expect to complete our NDA submission in the first quarter of 2011.  Dapagliflozin – an oral compound in Phase III development for the treatment of diabetes that is part of our strategic alliance with AstraZeneca        •    In September 2010, the Company and AstraZeneca announced results from a randomized, double blind Phase III clinical study of dapagliflozin at the 46th European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Annual Meeting which demonstrated that the addition of dapagliflozin to glimepiride (a sulphonylurea) therapy produced significant reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes compared to glimepiride alone. The study also demonstrated that dapagliflozin plus glimepiride achieved reductions in the secondary efficacy endpoints of change in total body weight, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels from baseline at week 24 compared to placebo plus glimepiride. More people taking dapagliflozin and glimepiride were able to achieve a target HbA1c of less than 7% compared to patients taking glimepiride alone. Also, drug-related adverse affects were reported at a similar rate between treatment groups, but signs, symptoms and other reports suggestive of genital tract infections, but not urinary tract infections, were more frequently reported in dapagliflozin treated subjects.        •    In September 2010, the Company and AstraZeneca also announced at the EASD results from a randomized, double-blind Phase III clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin therapy alone. The study demonstrated dapagliflozin was non-inferior compared to glipizide in improving HbA1c when added to existing metformin therapy during a 52-week treatment period. The study also demonstrated that dapagliflozin plus metformin achieved significant reductions in key efficacy secondary endpoints: reduction in total body weight from baseline, compared with a weight gain on glipizide plus metformin therapy and a reduced number of patients reporting one or more hypoglycemic events. Also, frequencies of adverse events, serious adverse events and study discontinuations were comparable across treatment groups, but signs, symptoms and other reports suggestive of urinary tract or genital infections were more common in dapagliflozin treated subjects.    36    Table of Contents       •    We have assessed the cardiovascular risk for dapagliflozin in accordance with FDA’s guidance for diabetes drug candidates and we believe the analysis supports submission in the U.S. We are planning to file regulatory submissions for dapagliflozin in both the U.S. and the European Union (EU) later this year or early next year.  NULOJIX (belatacept) – a fusion protein with novel immunosuppressive activity targeted at prevention of solid organ transplant rejection. The FDA accepted for filing and review our submission of a biologic license application for belatacept in September 2009.        •    We have submitted a response to the FDA’s complete response letter regarding the BLA for NULOJIX. The FDA has advised us that we must resolve the GMP issues raised in the FDA’s recent warning letter regarding our manufacturing facility in Manati, Puerto Rico prior to its granting approval of our pending BLA for NULOJIX. We currently expect that our Manati facility will be inspection-ready by the end of the year and that the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for FDA action on the BLA on NULOJIX will be in the second quarter of 2011. See “Part II—Other Information—Item 1A. Risk Factors” for more information.  Three Months Results of Operations  Our results of continuing operations exclude the results of the Mead Johnson business prior to its split-off in December 2009. This business has been segregated from continuing operations and included in discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2009, see “—Discontinued Operations” below.  Our results of continuing operations were as follows:                        Three Months Ended September 30,    Dollars in Millions   2010     2009     % Change     Net Sales   $ 4,798     $ 4,788       —     Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes   $ 1,614     $ 1,565       3 %    % of net sales     33.6 %      32.7 %         Provision for Income Taxes   $ 312     $ 366       (15 )%    Effective tax rate     19.3 %      23.4 %         Net Earnings from Continuing Operations   $ 1,302     $ 1,199       9 %    % of net sales     27.1 %      25.0 %         Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest   $ 353     $ 307       15 %    % of net sales     7.3 %      6.4 %         Attributable to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company   $ 949     $ 892       6 %    % of net sales     19.8 %      18.6 %       Net Sales  The composition of the change in net sales was as follows:                                    Three Months Ended September 30,     2010 vs. 2009        Net Sales     Analysis of % Change    Dollars in Millions   2010     2009     Total Change     Volume     Price     Foreign Exchange     U.S.   $ 3,135     $ 3,012       4 %      1 %      3 %      —     Non-U.S.      1,663       1,776       (6 )%      —       (3 )%      (3 )%                                          Total   $ 4,798     $ 4,788       —       1 %      —       (1 )%                                        While various key U.S. products contributed to the growth in net sales, the increase was primarily driven by increased sales of PLAVIX* which represented 49% of total U.S. net sales. U.S. net sales increases were offset by the impact of healthcare reform and decreased sales of ABILIFY* (aripiprazole), which were negatively impacted by the reduction in our contractual share of net sales recognized from 65% to 58%.  International net sales decreased 6%, including a 3% unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2010 were negatively impacted by mature brands divested in prior periods; a 16% reduction in PLAVIX* net sales primarily due to generic competition in comarketing countries; and increased pricing pressures in certain European countries.  In general, our business is not seasonal. For information on U.S. pharmaceutical prescriber demand, reference is made to the table within “—Estimated End-User Demand” below, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of our key pharmaceuticals and new products. The U.S. and non-U.S. net sales are categorized based upon the location of the customer.    37    Table of Contents   We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported in the consolidated statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross-to-net sales adjustments. The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments was as follows:                    Three Months Ended September 30,    Dollars in Millions   2010     2009     Gross Sales   $ 5,360     $ 5,220     Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments             Prime Vendor Charge-Backs     (159 )      (131 )    Cash Discounts     (68 )      (64 )    Managed Healthcare Rebates and Other Contract Discounts     (131 )      (112 )    Medicaid Rebates     (114 )      (50 )    Sales Returns     (4 )      (31 )    Other Adjustments     (86 )      (44 )                      Total Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments     (562 )      (432 )                      Net Sales   $ 4,798     $ 4,788                     Gross-to-net sales adjustments as a percentage of gross sales were 10.5% in 2010 and 8.3% in 2009 and are typically correlated with gross sales trends, changes in sales mix and contractual and legislative discounts and rebates.  The enactment of healthcare reform in March 2010 impacted the Medicaid rebates adjustment for the three months ended September 30, 2010 due to the increase in the minimum Medicaid rebate on drug sales from 15.1% to 23.1% retroactive to January 1, 2010. The 2009 Medicaid rebates were impacted by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services policy group’s approval of the Company’s revised calculations for determining Medicaid rebates for the three year period 2002 through 2004, resulting in a $16 million reduction in the Medicaid liability for the three months ended September 30, 2009. Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discount adjustments were impacted by the extension of the Medicaid rebate rate to drugs sold to risk-based Medicaid managed care organizations. Expected future increases in gross-to-net sales adjustments related to healthcare reform are further discussed in “—Executive Summary—Healthcare Reform” above.    38    Table of Contents   Net sales of key products represented 85% and 81% of total net sales in the third quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively. The following table details U.S. and international net sales by key product, the percentage change from the prior period and the foreign exchange impact when compared to the prior period.

Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased 2%.        •    International net sales continue to be impacted by the launch of generic clopidogrel products in the EU. This has a negative impact on both our net sales as it relates to our EU sales in comarketing countries and our equity in net income of affiliates as it relates to our share of sales from our partnership with sanofi in Europe and Asia. We expect continued erosion of PLAVIX* net sales in the EU, which will impact both our international net sales and our equity in net income of affiliates.        •    See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 17. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies—PLAVIX* Litigation,” for further discussion on PLAVIX* exclusivity litigation in both the U.S. and the EU.  AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (known in the EU as APROVEL*/KARVEA*) — an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy that is also part of the sanofi alliance        •    U.S. net sales decreased primarily due to lower U.S. prescription demand partially offset by higher average net selling prices. U.S. prescription demand decreased 19%.        •    International net sales decreased primarily due to lower demand resulting from generic competition.  REYATAZ — a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV        •    U.S. net sales remained relatively flat. Total U.S. prescription demand increased 2%.        •    International net sales increased primarily due to higher demand across most international markets.  SUSTIVA Franchise — a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, which includes SUSTIVA (efavirenz), an antiretroviral drug, and bulk efavirenz, which is also included in the combination therapy, ATRIPLA* (efavirenz 600mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), a product sold through a joint venture with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead)        •    U.S. net sales increased primarily due to higher demand as well as higher average net selling prices. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 6%.        •    International net sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange partially offset by higher demand.  BARACLUDE — an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B        •    Sold primarily in international markets, net sales increased mainly due to higher demand.        •    U.S. prescription demand increased 13%.  ERBITUX* — a monoclonal antibody designed to exclusively target and block the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, which is expressed on the surface of certain cancer cells in multiple tumor types as well as normal cells and is currently indicated for use against colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. ERBITUX* is part of our strategic alliance with Lilly        •    Sold almost exclusively in the U.S., net sales decreased primarily due to lower demand.  SPRYCEL — an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases, for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including GLEEVEC* (imatinib meslylate), which is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka        •    U.S. net sales increased primarily due to higher average net selling prices and increased demand. Estimated total U.S. demand increased 5%.        •    International net sales increased primarily due to higher demand.  IXEMPRA — a microtubule inhibitor for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer and is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka        •    Worldwide net sales were flat.  ABILIFY* — an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania disorder and major depressive disorder and is part of the Company’s strategic alliance with Otsuka        •    U.S. net sales decreased primarily due to the reduction in our contractual share of net sales recognized from 65% to 58% and increased Medicaid rebates from healthcare reform. The decrease was partially offset by higher average net selling prices. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 3%.        •    International net sales increased primarily due to increased prescription demand.    40    Table of Contents   ORENCIA — a fusion protein indicated for rheumatoid arthritis        •    U.S. net sales increased due to increased demand and higher average net selling prices.        •    International net sales increased primarily due to higher demand.  ONGLYZA — a once-daily oral tablet for the treatment of type 2 diabetes        •    Worldwide net sales increased from demand generated since the initial launch of ONGLYZA in various countries, including the U.S., beginning in the third quarter of 2009.  Mature Brands and Other Products — includes products which lost their exclusivity in major markets and over the counter brands        •    International net sales decreased due to continued generic erosion of certain brands including TAXOL (paclitaxel) and PRAVACHOL (pravastatin sodium), lower average net selling prices in Europe, the year over year impact of the rationalization and divestitures of our non-strategic product portfolio and lower demand for certain over the counter products.  The estimated U.S. prescription change data provided throughout this report includes information only from the retail and mail order channels and does not reflect product demand within other channels such as hospitals, home health care, clinics, federal facilities including VA hospitals, and long-term care, among others. The data is provided by Wolters Kluwer Health (WK), except for SPRYCEL, and based on the Source Prescription Audit which is a product of WK's own recordkeeping and projection processes. As such, the data is subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling and may include a margin of error.  The change in SPRYCEL demand is calculated based upon tablets sold though retail and mail order channels based upon data obtained from the IMS Health (IMS) National Sales Perspectives Audit, which is a product of IMS’ own recordkeeping and projection processes. As such, the data is subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling and may include a margin of error.  We continuously seek to improve the quality of our estimates of prescription change amounts and ultimate patient/consumer demand by reviewing the calculation methodologies employed, and analyzing internal and third-party data. We expect to continue to review and refine our methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and will monitor the quality of our own and third parties’ data used in such calculations.  We calculated the estimated total U.S. prescription change on a weighted-average basis to reflect the fact that mail order prescriptions include a higher average volume of product supplied per dispensed prescription, compared to retail prescriptions. Mail order prescriptions typically reflect a 90-day prescription whereas retail prescriptions typically reflect a 30-day prescription. The calculation is derived by multiplying mail order prescription data by a factor that approximates three and adding to this the retail prescriptions. We believe that a calculation of estimated total U.S. prescription change based on this weighted-average approach provides a superior estimate of total prescription demand, in retail and mail order channels. We use this methodology for our internal demand reporting.    41    Table of Contents   Estimated End-User Demand  The following table sets forth for each of our key products sold in the U.S. for the three months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year: (i) total U.S. net sales for the period; (ii) change in reported U.S. net sales for the period; (iii) estimated total U.S. prescription change for the retail and mail order channels calculated by us based on third-party data on a weighted-average basis and (iv) months of inventory on hand in the wholesale distribution channel.

(b) ERBITUX*, IXEMPRA and ORENCIA are parenterally administered products and do not have prescription-level data as physicians do not write prescriptions for these products.    (c) ONGLYZA was launched in the U.S. in August 2009.  Pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Consent Order described in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the U.S. in the direct customer distribution channel. We disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. In the case of the Company’s U.S. Pharmaceuticals products at September 30, 2010, there were no products to disclose. The following are international products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand at June 30, 2010:  VIDEX/VIDEX EC, an antiviral product, had approximately 1.2 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to approximately 1.3 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2009. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to government purchasing patterns in Brazil.  FERVEX, a cold and flu product, had approximately 5.5 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to approximately 3.9 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2009. The increased level of inventory on hand was primarily due to lower demand attributed to a mild flu season.  ONGLYZA had approximately 1.2 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers. The level of inventory on hand was due to the recent launch of ONGLYZA in Brazil and Spain.  In the U.S., for all products sold exclusively through wholesalers or through distributors, we determined our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. products, and provided by some of our distributors. Factors that may influence our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their record keeping processes.  For products in the U.S. that are not sold exclusively through wholesalers or distributors and for our business outside of the U.S., we have significantly more direct customers. Limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. In cases where direct customer product level inventory, ultimate patient/consumer demand or out-movement data does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of other methodologies to estimate such data, including using such factors as historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, direct    42    Table of Contents  customer purchases in light of price increases, new product or product presentation launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. businesses for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 is not available prior to the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand for the current quarter, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next annual report on Form 10-K.  Geographic Areas  In general, our products are available in most countries in the world. The largest markets are the U.S., France, Canada, Japan, Italy, Spain, Germany, China and the United Kingdom. Our net sales by geographic area, based on the location of the customer, were as follows:                                Three Months Ended September 30,        Net Sales     % of Total Net Sales    Dollars in Millions   2010     2009     % Change     2010     2009     United States   $ 3,135     $ 3,012       4%       65%       63%     Europe     804       911       (12)%       17%       19%     Latin America, the Middle East and Africa     207       213       (3)%       4%       5%     Japan, Asia Pacific and Canada     419       394       6%       9%       8%     Emerging Markets     211       203       4%       4%       4%     Other     22       55       (60)%       1%       1%                                            Total   $ 4,798     $ 4,788       —        100%       100%                                          For discussion of U.S. net sales variances, see “—Net Sales” above.  Net sales in Europe decreased primarily due to a 9% unfavorable foreign exchange impact due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the prior period against the Euro and the British pound. In addition, continued reduction in sales of mature brands and other products and reduced net sales from continued generic erosion of PLAVIX* and AVAPRO* were partially offset by growth in various key products including ABILIFY*, BARACLUDE and the HIV portfolio (which includes REYATAZ and the SUSTIVA Franchise). Due to the heightening financial challenges in European countries, healthcare payers, including government agencies, continue to explore ways to reduce the cost of healthcare including actions that would directly or indirectly impose additional price reductions and support the expanded use of generic drugs. These measures include, but are not limited to, mandatory discounts, rebates and other price reductions on product sales.  Net sales in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa decreased slightly as reduced sales of mature brands and other products were mostly offset by increased sales of various key brands.  Net sales in Japan, Asia Pacific and Canada were impacted by a 7% favorable foreign exchange impact. Increased sales of BARACLUDE and SPRYCEL were more than offset by decreased net sales of PLAVIX* and mature brands and other products due to increasing generic competition.  Emerging Markets are Brazil, Russia, India, China and Turkey. Net sales in Emerging Markets increased primarily due to a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact in addition to increased sales of certain key products including REYATAZ and SPRYCEL which more than offset reduced sales of mature brands and other products.  Net sales in Other decreased primarily due to divestitures.  No country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of our total net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.    43    Table of Contents   Expenses                                Three Months Ended September 30,        Expenses     % of Net Sales    Dollars in Millions   2010     2009     % Change     2010     2009     Cost of products sold   $  1,280     $ 1,317       (3)%       26.7%       27.5%     Marketing, selling and administrative     892       953       (6)%       18.6%       19.9%     Advertising and product promotion     231       256       (10)%       4.8%       5.3%     Research and development     824       820       —       17.2%       17.1%     Provision for restructuring     15       51       (71)%       0.3%       1.1%     Litigation expense     22       —       —       0.5%       —     Equity in net income of affiliates     (70)       (139)       (50)%       (1.5)%       (2.9)%     Other (income)/expense     (10)       (35)       (71)%       (0.2)%       (0.7)%                                            Total Expenses   $ 3,184     $ 3,223       (1)%       66.4%       67.3%                                          Cost of products sold  The decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributed to lower manufacturing costs, a more favorable product mix and favorable foreign exchange partially offset by the reduction in our share of ABILIFY* sales related to the extended commercialization and manufacturing agreement for ABILIFY*, and the collaboration fee paid to Otsuka related to the SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA Oncology collaboration beginning in 2010.  Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, our portion of ABILIFY*’s U.S. net sales recognized decreased from 65% to 58%. In addition, we paid a collaboration fee to Otsuka, totaling $30 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010, under the Oncology collaboration for SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA. See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations” for further discussion.  Marketing, selling and administrative  The decrease was primarily due to Otsuka’s reimbursement of certain ABILIFY*, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA operating expenses, beginning January 1, 2010, the reduction in our ABILIFY* sales force, as Otsuka established its own sales force for the promotion of the above products, and a reduction in sales related activities of certain key products to coincide with their respective life cycles, offset by increased spending for the ONGLYZA launch and other pipeline products. See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations” for further discussion.  Advertising and product promotion  The decrease was attributed to reduced spending on the promotion of certain key products to coincide with their product life cycle and Otsuka’s reimbursement of certain ABILIFY*, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA advertising and product promotion expenses partially offset by increased spending for the ONGLYZA launch and other pipeline products.  Research and development  Research and development remained flat. There were no upfront or milestone payments in the third quarters of 2010 and 2009.  Provision for restructuring  The changes in provision for restructuring were primarily attributable to the timing of certain PTI and continuous improvement initiatives.  Litigation expense  Litigation expense in 2010 is related to additional reserves established for certain average wholesale prices (AWP) litigation. For additional information on litigation matters, see “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 17. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies.”  Equity in net income of affiliates  The decrease was attributed to the continued impact of generic clopidogrel competition on international PLAVIX* net sales. This unfavorable trend is expected to continue in future periods. For additional information, see “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations.”    44    Table of Contents   Other (income)/expense  Other (income)/expense includes:                    Three Months Ended September 30,    Dollars in Millions   2010     2009     Interest expense   $ 38     $ 47     Interest income     (23 )      (13 )    Impairment and loss on sale of manufacturing operations     10       —     Loss on debt buyback and termination of interest rate swap agreements     —       4     Net foreign exchange transaction losses     9       13     Gain on sale of product lines, businesses and assets     (21 )      (17 )    Medarex acquisition     —       (10 )    Other income received from alliance partners     (28 )      (50 )    Pension curtailment and settlement charges     2       —     Other     3       (9 )                      Other (income)/expense   $ (10 )    $ (35 )                          •    Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower interest rates.        •    Interest income increased primarily due to higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.        •    Other income received from alliance partners includes income earned from the sanofi partnership and amortization of certain upfront licensing and milestone receipts related to our alliances. The decrease was due to sanofi purchasing less inventory from us as a result of reduced sales in Australia and Mexico due to generic competition.

Non-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance which include the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of pharmaceutical products on a global basis and to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting for future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Among the items in GAAP measures but excluded for purposes of determining adjusted earnings and other adjusted measures are: charges related to implementation of the PTI; gains or losses from the purchase or sale of businesses, product lines or investments; discontinued operations; restructuring and other exit costs; accelerated depreciation charges; asset impairments; charges and recoveries relating to significant legal proceedings; upfront licensing and milestone payments for in-licensing of products that have not achieved regulatory approval, which are immediately expensed; special initiative funding to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation; and significant tax events. For a detailed listing of items that are excluded from the non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations, see “—Specified Items” above. Similar charges or gains for some of these items have been recognized in prior periods and it is reasonably possible that they will reoccur in future periods.

See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes” for further discussion.    46    Table of Contents   Discontinued Operations  As discussed in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed the split-off of Mead Johnson in December 2009. The results of the Mead Johnson business are included in net earnings from discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2009. See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 5. Discontinued Operations” for further discussion.  Noncontrolling Interest  Noncontrolling interest is primarily related to our partnerships with sanofi for the territory covering the Americas related to PLAVIX* net sales. See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations” for further discussion. The increase in noncontrolling interest corresponds to increased profitability of PLAVIX* in the U.S. Net earnings from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest primarily relates to the 16.9% of Mead Johnson owned by the public prior to the split-off.

Most of the other key U.S. products also contributed to the growth in net sales.  International net sales remained flat, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact due to growth in various key products, including BARACLUDE (32%), the HIV portfolio (9%), ABILIFY* (19%), SPRYCEL (33%) and ORENCIA (40%). Offsetting these increases were decreased sales of mature brands and other products and a 10% reduction in PLAVIX* net sales (including a 5% favorable foreign exchange impact).    47    Table of Contents   In general, our business is not seasonal. For information on U.S. pharmaceutical prescriber demand, reference is made to the table within “—Estimated End-User Demand” below, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of our key pharmaceuticals and new products. The U.S. and non-U.S. net sales are categorized based upon the location of the customer.  The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments was as follows:                    Nine Months Ended September 30,    Dollars in Millions   2010     2009     Gross Sales   $ 15,932     $ 15,020     Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments             Prime Vendor Charge-Backs     (427 )      (376 )    Cash Discounts     (202 )      (187 )    Managed Healthcare Rebates and Other Contract Discounts     (370 )      (326 )    Medicaid Rebates     (328 )      (148 )    Sales Returns     (15 )      (69 )    Other Adjustments     (217 )      (139 )                      Total Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments     (1,559 )      (1,245 )                      Net Sales   $ 14,373     $ 13,775                     Gross-to-net sales adjustments as a percentage of gross sales were 9.8% in 2010 and 8.3% in 2009 and are typically correlated with gross sales trends, changes in sales mix and contractual and legislative discounts and rebates.  The enactment of U.S. healthcare reform in March 2010 impacted the Medicaid rebates adjustment for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 due to the increase in the minimum Medicaid rebate on drug sales from 15.1% to 23.1% retroactive to January 1, 2010. The 2009 Medicaid rebates were impacted by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services policy group’s approval of the Company’s revised calculations for determining Medicaid rebates for the three year period 2002 through 2004, resulting in a $50 million reduction in the Medicaid liability in the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discount adjustments were impacted by the extension of the Medicaid rebate rate to drugs sold to risk-based Medicaid managed care organizations. Expected future increases to gross-to-net sales adjustments related to U.S. healthcare reform are further discussed in “—Executive Summary—Healthcare Reform” above.  Prime vendor charge-backs and managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts increased primarily due to higher average PLAVIX* selling prices and increased sales. Sales returns decreased primarily due to reduced provisions for various mature brands based upon fewer returns than initially expected. Other adjustments increased primarily due to incremental discounts in the EU and increased promotional discount programs.

Estimated total U.S. prescription demand remained flat.        •    International net sales continue to be impacted by the launch of generic clopidogrel products in the EU. This has a negative impact on both our net sales as it relates to our EU sales in comarketing countries and our equity in net income of affiliates as it relates to our share of sales from our partnership with sanofi in Europe and Asia. The impact was partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. We expect continued erosion of PLAVIX* net sales in the EU, which will impact both our international net sales and our equity in net income of affiliates.        •    See “Item 1.

IXEMPRA        •    Worldwide net sales increased primarily due to higher demand.  ABILIFY*        •    U.S. net sales decreased primarily due to the reduction in our contractual share of net sales recognized from 65% to 58% and increased Medicaid rebates from healthcare reform.

Our net sales by geographic area, based on the location of the customer, were as follows:                                Nine Months Ended September 30,        Net Sales     % of Total Net Sales    Dollars in Millions   2010     2009     % Change     2010     2009     United States   $ 9,329     $ 8,752       7%       65%       64%     Europe     2,512       2,621       (4)%       18%       19%     Latin America, the Middle East and Africa     631       624       1%       4%       4%     Japan, Asia Pacific and Canada     1,193       1,092       9%       8%       8%     Emerging Markets     615       543       13%       4%       4%     Other     93       143       (35)%       1%       1%                                            Total   $ 14,373     $ 13,775       4%       100%       100%                                          For discussion of U.S. net sales variances, see “—Net Sales” above.  Net sales in Europe decreased primarily due to a 2% unfavorable foreign exchange impact. In addition, continued reduction in sales of mature brands and other products and reduced net sales from continued generic erosion of PLAVIX* were partially offset by growth in various key products including ABILIFY*, the HIV portfolio, BARACLUDE, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA.    51    Table of Contents   Net sales in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa increased primarily due to a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact. In addition, increased sales of various key products, including, SPRYCEL, BARACLUDE, REYATAZ and ORENCIA were more than offset by reduced sales of mature brands and other products.  Net sales in Japan, Asia Pacific and Canada increased primarily due to a 10% favorable foreign exchange impact. Increased sales of various key products, including BARACLUDE and SPRYCEL, were offset by decreased net sales of PLAVIX* and mature brands and other products, including TAXOL, due to increasing generic competition.  Net sales in Emerging Markets increased primarily due to a 5% favorable foreign exchange impact in addition to increased sales of REYATAZ, BARACLUDE, SPRYCEL and ABILIFY*. These increases more than offset decreased sales of mature brands and other products.  Net sales in Other decreased primarily due to divestitures.  No country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of our total net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.

Marketing, selling and administrative  The decrease was primarily attributed to Otsuka’s reimbursement of certain ABILIFY*, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA operating expenses, beginning January 1, 2010, the reduction in our ABILIFY* sales force, as Otsuka established its own sales force for the promotion of the above products, and a reduction in sales related activities of certain key products to coincide with their respective life cycles, offset by increased spending for the ONGLYZA launch and other pipeline products.  Advertising and product promotion  The decrease was attributed to reduced spending on the promotion of certain key products to coincide with their product life cycle and Otsuka’s reimbursement of certain ABILIFY*, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA advertising and product promotion expenses partially offset by increased spending for the ONGLYZA launch and other pipeline products.  Research and development  The increase was attributed to additional support of our maturing pipeline and compounds obtained from our string-of-pearls strategy and a $17 million payment to Exelixis to end our development collaboration for the experimental cancer drug XL184 partially offset by decreased upfront licensing and milestone payments. Upfront licensing and milestone payments of $55 million were paid to Allergan and PDL BioPharma Inc. during the first nine months of 2010 and $174 million were paid to ZymoGenetics, Nissan and Albany Molecular in the first nine months of 2009.    52    Table of Contents   Provision for restructuring  The changes in provision for restructuring were primarily attributable to the timing of the implementation of certain PTI and continuous improvement initiatives.  Litigation expense  Litigation expense in 2010 is related to additional reserves established for certain average wholesale prices (AWP) litigation. The 2009 expense was primarily due to the establishment of a $125 million reserve related to securities litigation. For further details refer to “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 17. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies.”  Equity in net income of affiliates  The decrease was attributed to the continued impact of generic clopidogrel competition on international PLAVIX* net sales.

See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 4. Restructuring.”      •    Gain on sale of product lines, businesses and assets was primarily related to the sale of mature brands.      •    Other income received from alliance partners includes income earned from the sanofi partnership and amortization of certain upfront licensing and milestone receipts related to our alliances.    53    Table of Contents   Specified Items  During the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, the following specified items affected the comparability of results of the periods presented herein.

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes was 21.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to 23.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes” for further discussion.  Discontinued Operations  As discussed in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed the split-off of Mead Johnson in December 2009. The results of the Mead Johnson business are included in net earnings from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 5. Discontinued Operations” for further discussion.  Noncontrolling Interest  Noncontrolling interest is primarily related to our partnerships with sanofi for the territory covering the Americas related to PLAVIX* net sales. See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations” for further discussion. The increase in noncontrolling interest corresponds to increased profitability of PLAVIX* in the U.S. Net earnings from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest primarily relates to the 16.9% of Mead Johnson owned by the public prior to the split-off. A summary of noncontrolling interest is as follows:                    Nine Months Ended September 30,    Dollars in Millions   2010     2009     sanofi partnerships   $ 1,543     $ 1,258     Other     18       21                       Noncontrolling interest—pre-tax     1,561       1,279     Income taxes     509       412                       Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interest—net of taxes     1,052       867     Net earnings from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest—net of taxes     —       55                       Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest—net of taxes   $ 1,052     $ 922                     Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources  Net cash position was as follows:                Dollars in Millions   September 30,2010     December 31,2009     Cash and cash equivalents   $ 7,581     $ 7,683     Marketable securities—current     778       831     Marketable securities—non-current     2,562       1,369                       Total     10,921       9,883                           Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt     243       231     Long-term debt     6,479       6,130                       Total debt     6,722       6,361                           Net cash position   $ 4,199     $ 3,522                       55    Table of Contents   We maintain a significant level of working capital, which was approximately $8.1 billion at September 30, 2010 and $7.6 billion at December 31, 2009. In 2010 and future periods, we expect cash generated by our operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic alliances and acquisitions, including $885 million for the acquisition of ZymoGenetics in October 2010, milestone payments, dividends paid in the U.S. and common stock repurchases.  Our investment portfolio contains non-current marketable securities including corporate debt securities. These investments are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors, which may impact our results of operations. Our investment policy places limits on these investments and the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. The policy also requires that investments are only made with highly rated corporate and financial institutions. See “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 9. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities.”  We continue to monitor the potential impact of the deteriorating economic conditions in certain European countries further discussed in “—Geographic Areas” above and the related impact on prescription trends, pricing discounts, creditworthiness of our customers, and our ability to collect outstanding receivables from such countries.  We have a $2.0 billion five year revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders maturing in December 2011, which is extendable with the consent of the lenders. This facility contains customary terms and conditions, including a financial covenant whereby the ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated capital cannot exceed 50% at the end of each quarter. We have been in compliance with this covenant since the inception of this facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009.  As an additional source of liquidity, we sell trade accounts receivables, principally from non-U.S. governments and hospital customers primarily in Japan, Italy, Portugal and Spain, to third parties. The receivables are sold on a nonrecourse basis and approximated $674 million and $343 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our sales agreements do not allow for recourse in the event of uncollectibility and we do not retain interest to the underlying asset once sold.  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. was approximately $7.4 billion at September 30, 2010 and $5.3 billion at December 31, 2009 which is either used to fund non-U.S. operations or repatriated back to the U.S., in which case taxes on those amounts are already reserved. Cash repatriations are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes.  Credit Ratings  Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A2 and Prime-1, respectively, and their long-term credit rating remains on stable outlook. Standard & Poor’s (S&P) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A+ and A-1, respectively, and their long-term credit rating remains on stable outlook. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A+ and F1, respectively, and their long-term credit rating changed in August from stable to negative outlook. Our credit ratings are considered investment grade. These ratings for long-term securities designate that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. These ratings for short-term obligations designate that we have the strongest capacity for timely repayment.  Cash Flows  The following is a discussion of cash flow activities:                    Nine Months Ended September 30,    Dollars in Millions   2010     2009     Cash flow provided by/(used in):             Operating activities   $ 2,896     $ 2,721     Investing activities     (1,333 )      (3,353 )    Financing activities     (1,679 )      (1,011 )    56    Table of Contents   Operating Activities  Cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and cash disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing activities and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for:        •    Noncontrolling interest;        •    Non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation charges;        •    Gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities such as gains and losses on the sale of product lines and businesses; and        •    Changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations.  The net impact of the changes in operating assets and liabilities, which are discussed in more detail below, include changes in receivables, inventories, deferred income, accounts payable, income taxes receivable/payable and other operating assets and liabilities.  The net impact of the changes in operating assets and liabilities aggregated to a net cash outflow of $685 million and $587 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These items included the impact of changes in receivables, inventories, deferred income, accounts payable, income taxes receivable/payable and other operating assets and liabilities which are discussed in more detail below.  We continue to maximize our operating cash flows with our working capital initiative designed to continue to improve working capital items that are most directly affected by changes in sales volume, such as receivables, inventories and accounts payable. Those improvements are being driven by several actions including additional non-recourse factoring of non-US trade receivables, revised contractual payment terms with customers and vendors, enhanced collection processes and various supply chain initiatives designed to optimize inventory levels. Progress in this area is monitored each period and is a component of our annual incentive plan. The following summarizes certain working capital components expressed as a percentage of trailing twelve months’ net sales:                        Dollars in Millions   September 30,2010     % of TrailingTwelve MonthNet Sales     December 31,2009     % of TrailingTwelve MonthNet Sales     Net trade receivables   $ 1,965       10.1%     $ 1,897       10.1%     Inventories     1,369       7.1%       1,413       7.5%     Accounts payable     (1,725 )      (8.9)%       (1,711 )      (9.1)%                                 Total   $ 1,609       8.3%     $ 1,599       8.5%                               During the first nine months of 2010, changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash outflow of $685 million which was impacted by:        •    Cash outflows from other operating assets and liabilities ($417 million) primarily related to the pension funding in excess of current year expense ($336 million) and decreases in accrued bonuses and salaries due to the timing of payments ($57 million);        •    Cash outflows from U.S. and foreign income tax payable ($187 million) primarily attributed to timing of tax payment;        •    Cash outflows from receivables ($122 million) primarily attributed to the timing of cash receipts.  In the first nine months of 2009, changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash outflow of $587 million which was impacted by:        •    Cash outflows from other operating assets and liabilities ($1.1 billion) primarily related to pension funding in excess of current year expense ($517 million), alliance payment to Otsuka which will be amortized as a reduction of net sales through the ABILIFY* extension period ($400 million) and decreases in accrued bonuses and salaries due to the timing of payments ($111 million);        •    Cash inflows from accounts payable ($228 million) primarily attributed to the timing of vendor and alliance payments, as well as the impact of the above noted working capital initiative;        •    Cash inflows from deferred income ($135 million) mainly due to the milestone payments received from Pfizer ($150 million) and AstraZeneca ($100 million), partially offset by amortization; and        •    Cash inflows from receivables ($77 million) primarily attributed to additional factoring of non-U.S. trade receivables.    57    Table of Contents   Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities was $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2010 and included:        •    Net purchases of marketable securities ($1.1 billion); and        •    Capital expenditures ($299 million).  Net cash used in investing activities was $3.4 billion in the first nine months of 2009 and included:        •    Purchase of Medarex ($2.2 billion);        •    Net purchases of marketable securities ($717 million);        •    Capital expenditures ($534 million); and        •    Proceeds from the divestiture of mature brand businesses ($85 million), including the Pakistan business ($32 million), other Middle Eastern manufacturing businesses ($17 million) and various trademarks ($31 million).  Financing Activities  Net cash used in financing activities was $1.7 billion in the first nine months of 2010 and included:        •    Dividend payments ($1.7 billion); and        •    Repurchases of common stock ($353 million); partially offset by        •    Net proceeds from the exercise of stock options ($211 million); and        •    Net proceeds from the termination of interest rate swap agreements ($98 million).  Net cash used in financing activities was $1.0 billion in the first nine months of 2009 and included:        •    Dividend payments ($1.9 billion); and        •    Repurchase of 5.875% Notes due 2036 ($67 million), 7.15% Notes due 2023 ($44 million) and 6.8% Notes due 2026 ($21 million); partially offset by        •    Net proceeds from the Mead Johnson initial public offering ($782 million); and        •    Net proceeds from the termination of interest rate swap agreements ($194 million).  Dividends declared per common share were $0.96 for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and $0.93 for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. We paid $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion in dividends for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, respectively. The decrease in total dividends, despite the per share increase, is primarily attributed to the 269 million share reduction from the Mead Johnson split-off. Dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors.    58    Table of Contents   Critical Accounting Policies  For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The enactment of healthcare reform impacted certain judgments and estimates related to our accrued rebates and returns. See “—Executive Summary—Healthcare Reform” above for further detail.  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as “should”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “target”, “may”, “project”, “guidance”, “intend”, “plan”, “believe” and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and projections regarding our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this report and in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly under “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement.  Although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.    59    Table of Contents   Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  For a discussion of our market risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  For information regarding executions of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts, see “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 16. Financial Instruments.”  Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are effective.  PART II—OTHER INFORMATION  Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  Information pertaining to legal proceedings can be found in “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 17. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies,” to the interim consolidated financial statements, and is incorporated by reference herein.  Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K except for the following:  We have received a warning letter from the FDA and we may not be able to timely and adequately address the manufacturing issues raised in the warning letter.  We have received a warning letter from the FDA regarding our manufacturing facility in Manati, Puerto Rico. The warning letter focuses on certain GMP processes and practices, which the FDA identified during an inspection, that are to be improved or remediated. We have provided a response to the warning letter and expect that the Manati facility will be inspection-ready by the end of the year. If we are unable to timely and adequately improve or remediate the GMP issues identified to the FDA’s satisfaction, we could be subject to additional inspectional observations by the FDA requiring remediation. If any of these observations are serious, we could face additional negative consequences including a temporary delay in production at the facility for further corrective action.  In addition, the FDA has advised us that these GMP issues must be resolved prior to its granting approval of our pending Biologics License Application (BLA) for NULOJIX (belatacept). Any delay in the timing of when we expect the Manati facility to be inspection-ready could further delay a decision by the FDA on the BLA for NULOJIX.  The resolution of manufacturing issues with the FDA discussed in this Form 10-Q, as well as the potential impact of those issues on our revenues and earnings, are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties, including the timing, scope and duration of a resolution of the manufacturing issues, will depend on our ability to address the issues identified in the FDA’s warning letter.    60    Table of Contents   Item 2.
