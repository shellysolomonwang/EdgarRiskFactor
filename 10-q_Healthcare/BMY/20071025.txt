Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Company’s 2006 Form 10-K, and “Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  PLAVIX* Litigation  PLAVIX* is currently the Company’s largest product ranked by net sales. Net sales of PLAVIX* were $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, and $3.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. U.S. net sales of PLAVIX* for the same periods were $2.7 billion, and $2.9 billion, respectively. The PLAVIX* patents are subject to a number of challenges in the U.S., including the litigation with Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (Apotex) described below, and in other less significant markets for the product. It is not possible reasonably to estimate the impact of these lawsuits on the Company. However, loss of market exclusivity of PLAVIX* and sustained generic competition would be material to the Company’s sales of PLAVIX*, results of operations and cash flows, and could be material to the Company’s financial condition and liquidity. The Company and its product partner, Sanofi, (the Companies) intend to vigorously pursue enforcement of their patent rights in PLAVIX*.  PLAVIX* Litigation – U.S.  Patent Infringement Litigation against Apotex and Related Matters  As previously disclosed, the Company’s U.S. territory partnership under its alliance with Sanofi is a plaintiff in a pending patent infringement lawsuit instituted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (District court) entitled Sanofi-Synthelabo, Sanofi-Synthelabo, Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Sanofi Pharmaceuticals Holding Partnership v. Apotex. The suit is based on U.S. Patent No. 4,847,265 (the ‘265 Patent), a composition of matter patent, which discloses and claims, among other things, the hydrogen sulfate salt of clopidogrel, a medicine made available in the U.S. by the Companies as PLAVIX*. Plaintiffs’ infringement position is based on Apotex’s filing of their Abbreviated New Drug Applications (aNDA) with the FDA, seeking approval to sell generic clopidogrel bisulfate prior to the expiration of the composition of matter patent in 2011. Apotex has alleged that the patent is invalid and/or unenforceable.  As previously disclosed, on August 8, 2006, Apotex launched a generic version of clopidogrel bisulfate. On August 31, 2006, the District court issued a preliminary injunction ordering Apotex to halt sales of generic clopidogrel bisulfate, but not to recall product from its customers. On June 19, 2007, the District court issued an opinion and order upholding the validity and enforceability of the ‘265 Patent, maintaining the main patent protection for PLAVIX* in the U.S. until November 2011. The District court also ruled that Apotex’s generic clopidogrel bisulfate product infringed the ‘265 Patent and permanently enjoined Apotex from engaging in any activity that infringes the ‘265 Patent, including marketing its generic product in the U.S. until after the patent expires. The amount of damages will be set at a later time. Apotex’s appeal of the District Court’s decision is pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The District court has stayed certain antitrust counterclaims brought by Apotex pending the outcome of the appeal. Activities relating to the damages phase of the litigation are continuing.  As also previously disclosed, the Company’s U.S. territory partnership under its alliance with Sanofi is also a plaintiff in three additional pending patent infringement lawsuits against Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, LTD (Dr. Reddy’s), Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) and Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Cobalt), all related to the ‘265 Patent. A trial date for the action against Dr. Reddy’s has not been set. The patent infringement actions against Teva and Cobalt were stayed pending resolution of the Apotex litigation, and the parties to those actions agreed to be bound by the outcome of the litigation against Apotex, although Teva and Cobalt can appeal the outcome of the litigation. Consequently, on July 12, 2007, the District court entered     20    Table of Contents Note 17. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies (Continued)     judgments against Cobalt and Teva and permanently enjoined Cobalt and Teva from engaging in any activity that infringes the ‘265 Patent until after the Patent expires. Cobalt and Teva have each filed an appeal. Each of Dr. Reddy’s, Teva and Cobalt have filed an aNDA with the FDA, and all exclusivity periods and statutory stay periods under the Hatch-Waxman Act have expired. Accordingly, final approval by the FDA would provide each company authorization to distribute a generic clopidogrel bisulfate product in the U.S., subject to various legal remedies for which the Companies may apply including injunctive relief and damages.  It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcomes of the appeal by Apotex of the District court’s decision, or the other PLAVIX* patent litigations or the timing of any renewed generic competition for PLAVIX* from Apotex or additional generic competition for PLAVIX* from other third-party generic pharmaceutical companies. However, if Apotex were to prevail in an appeal of the patent litigation, the Company would expect to face renewed generic competition for PLAVIX* from Apotex promptly thereafter. Loss of market exclusivity for PLAVIX* and/or sustained generic competition would be material to the Company’s sales of PLAVIX*, results of operations and cash flows, and could be material to the Company’s financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, it is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the amount of damages that could be recovered by the Company and Apotex’s ability to pay such damages in the event the Company prevails in Apotex’s appeal of the District Court decision.  See “Securities Litigation” below for a further discussion of certain other litigations relating to PLAVIX*.  Consumer Fraud  As previously reported, a purported class action complaint, Skilstaf, Inc. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, et al., (3:06 CV 04965) was filed against the Company and various Sanofi entities in the U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey. The complaint asserted among other things, violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act based on alleged misrepresentations about the safety and effectiveness of PLAVIX*. On October 23, 2007, plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal with the Court, and the complaint has been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.  PLAVIX* Litigation – International  PLAVIX* – Australia  Sanofi was notified that on August 17, 2007, GenRx Proprietary Limited (GenRx) obtained regulatory approval of an application for clopidogrel bisulfate 75mg tablets in Australia. In August 2007, GenRx filed an application in the Federal Court of Australia seeking revocation of Sanofi’s Australian Patent No. 597784 (Case No. NSD 1639 of 2007). Sanofi filed counterclaims of infringement and sought an injunction. On September 21, 2007, the Australian court granted Sanofi’s injunction and scheduled a trial date for April 2008. The Company is not a party to this action.  OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION  ABILIFY*  As previously disclosed, Otsuka has filed patent infringement actions against Teva, Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Barr), Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz), Synthon Laboratories, Inc (Synthon), Sun Pharmaceuticals (Sun) and Apotex relating to U.S. Patent No. 5,006,528, which covers aripiprazole and expires in October 2014. Aripiprazole is comarketed by the Company and Otsuka in the U.S. as ABILIFY*. Sun and Synthon have withdrawn their motions to dismiss the case and have agreed to litigate the case, along with Teva, Barr, Sandoz and Apotex, in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.  It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of these lawsuits or their impact on the Company.  ERBITUX*  RepliGen Litigation  As previously disclosed, in 2004, RepliGen Corporation (Repligen) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against ImClone, claiming that ImClone’s manufacture and sale of ERBITUX* infringes a patent that generally covers a process for protein production in mammalian cells. In July 2006, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of Repligen and MIT by rejecting one of ImClone’s defenses relating to patent exhaustion. On September 10, 2007, ImClone announced it has executed settlement and sublicensing agreements with MIT and Repligen to end this litigation. The agreements between ImClone and the Company include provisions pursuant to which certain financial consequences to the Company resulting from the settlement and sublicensing agreements would be the responsibility of ImClone.  Abbott Laboratories Litigation  As previously disclosed, in February 2007, Abbott Laboratories filed suit against ImClone in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that ImClone’s manufacture and sale of ERBITUX* infringe U.S. Patent No. 5,665,578 (the ‘578 Patent), and seeking damages for that alleged infringement. Pursuant to settlement and sublicensing agreements executed by ImClone and Repligen announced on September 10, 2007, Repligen granted ImClone a royalty-free, irrevocable worldwide sublicense for the future use of other patented technology, including the ‘578 Patent, owned by Abbott Laboratories and licensed to Repligen under an agreement between Abbott Laboratories and Repligen. The Company’s commercial agreements with ImClone include provisions pursuant to which certain financial consequences to the Company resulting from the settlement and sublicensing agreements would be the responsibility of ImClone. The settlement and sublicensing agreements, however, do not end this lawsuit.    21    Table of Contents Note 17. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies (Continued)    It is not possible at this time to assess the outcome of this lawsuit or the potential impact on the Company.  PRAVACHOL  In December 2006, LEK D.D. (LEK), a Slovenian generic company that is wholly owned by Novartis AG, filed suit against the Company and Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Watson) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in Marshall, Texas. LEK’s complaint alleges that the Company’s sale of PRAVACHOL and Watson’s sale of an authorized generic of PRAVACHOL infringe two patents of LEK. The patents are U.S. Patents Nos. 6,740,775, issued May 25, 2004 and 7,078,558, issued July 18, 2006. The Company filed an Answer to the Complaint in June 2007. The Company believes that it has a strong defense to this suit and intends to defend itself vigorously.  It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of these lawsuits or their impact on the Company.  SECURITIES LITIGATION  In Re Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Securities Litigation  In June and July 2007, two putative class action complaints, Minneapolis Firefighters’ Relief Assoc. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., et al., 07 CV 5867 and Jean Lai v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, et al., were filed in the U.S. District for the Southern District of New York against the Company, the Company’s former CEO, Peter Dolan and current Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Bonfield. The complaints allege violations of securities laws for allegedly failing to disclose material information relating to efforts to settle the PLAVIX* patent infringement litigation with Apotex. On September 20, 2007, the Court dismissed the Lai case without prejudice, changed the caption of the case to In re Bristol-Myers Squibb, Co. Securities Litigation, and appointed Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board as lead plaintiff. On October 15, 2007, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board filed an amended complaint making similar allegations as the earlier filed complaints, but no longer naming Andrew Bonfield as a defendant.  The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this litigation. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of these lawsuits, or the potential impact on the Company.  PRICING, SALES AND PROMOTIONAL PRACTICES LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATIONS  As previously disclosed, the Company, together with a number of defendants, is a defendant in a number of private civil matters relating to its pricing practices. In addition, the Company, together with a number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers, has received subpoenas and other document requests from various government agencies seeking records relating to its pricing, sales, marketing practices and best price reporting.  Investigations – Office of the U.S. Attorney, Massachusetts  On September 28, 2007, the Company, the Department Of Justice (DOJ), and the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts finalized the previously disclosed agreement in principle to settle several investigations involving the Company’s drug pricing, sales and marketing activities. The settlement agreement, which provides for a civil resolution, resolves matters that have been actively investigated by and discussed with the DOJ and the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts over a number of years, including matters relating to (1) the pricing for certain products sold several years ago by a subsidiary, which had been reimbursed by governmental health care programs; 2) financial relationships between that subsidiary and certain customers and other entities; 3) certain consulting programs; 4) the promotion of ABILIFY* for unapproved indications; 5) the calculation of certain Medicaid rebates for SERZONE (nefazodone hydrochloride); and 6) the pricing for certain of the Company’s products reimbursed by governmental health care programs. There will be no criminal charges against the Company with respect to those matters. Pursuant to the agreement, BMS agreed to pay $499 million plus interest to resolve the Federal and State claims, resulting in a total amount of approximately $516 million as of the settlement date. The Company has paid the federal portion of the global settlement, approximately $317 million plus interest. The State portion of the global settlement, approximately $182 million, plus interest, will not be disbursed unless the States approve the settlement. There can be no assurances that any or all States will approve the settlement. In connection with the settlement, the Company has entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The settlement only covers those matters outlined above, and the DOJ, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts and the States have indicated that they may pursue other matters outside the scope of the settlement, and in that event such matters could result in the assertion of civil and/or criminal claims.    22    Table of Contents Note 17. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies (Continued)    Also as previously disclosed, as a result of the agreement in principle, the Company had recorded aggregate reserves in the amount of $499 million plus interest for these matters. With payment of the federal portion of the global settlement now having been made, the remaining reserve is $182 million plus interest. If certain States choose not to participate, the amount reserved may not reflect eventual losses.  It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of any additional matters that the DOJ and the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts may pursue, or the potential impact on the Company.  Litigation  As previously disclosed, the Company, together with a number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers, is a defendant in private class actions, as well as suits brought by the attorneys general of numerous states, many New York counties, and the City of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs allege defendants caused the Average Wholesale Prices (AWPs) of their products to be inflated, thereby injuring government programs, entities and persons who reimbursed prescription drugs based on AWPs. Twelve state attorneys’ general suits are pending in federal and state courts around the country. A case in Alabama state court is scheduled to be the first to proceed to trial in February 2008. One set of class actions, a suit by the Arizona attorney general and several suits filed by New York Counties and the City of New York, have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (AWP MDL). The Court in the AWP MDL has certified three classes of persons and entities who paid for or reimbursed for seven of the Company’s physician-administered drugs. In June 2007, in a non-jury trial in the AWP MDL, the Court found the Company liable for violations of Massachusetts’ consumer protection laws with respect to certain oncology drugs for certain years and awarded damages in the amount of $183,454 for Class 3 (private third party payors) and instructed the parties to apply the Court’s opinion to determine damages for Class 2 (Medigap insurers). In August, 2007, the Court found damages of $187,789 for Class 2. The Company will appeal the June 2007 decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. As previously disclosed, in June 2007, the Company settled in principle the claims of Class 1 (Medicare Part B beneficiaries nationwide) for $13 million, plus half the costs of class notice up to a maximum payment of $1 million and the parties are finalizing the terms of the settlement. A hearing will be scheduled thereafter for preliminary approval of the Class 1 settlement.  The Company has recorded reserves of $14 million for these matters. In accordance with GAAP, the reserve reflects the Company’s estimate of probable loss with respect to these matters, assuming the settlement is finalized. If the settlement is not finalized, the amount reserved may not reflect eventual losses. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of the litigation matters described above, or their potential impact on the Company.  ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS  As previously reported, the Company is a party to several environmental proceedings and other matters, and is responsible under various state, Federal and foreign laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, (CERCLA), for certain costs of investigating and/or remediating contamination resulting from past industrial activity at the Company’s current or former sites or at waste disposal or reprocessing facilities operated by third parties.  CERCLA Matters  With respect to CERCLA matters for which the Company is responsible under various state, Federal and foreign laws, the Company typically estimates potential costs based on information obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or counterpart state agency and/or studies prepared by independent consultants, including the total estimated costs for the site and the expected cost-sharing, if any, with other “potentially responsible parties”, and the Company accrues liabilities when they are probable and reasonably estimable. As of September 30, 2007, the Company estimated its share of the total future costs for these sites to be approximately $68 million, recorded as other liabilities, which represents the sum of best estimates or, where no simple estimate can reasonably be made, estimates of the minimal probable amount among a range of such costs (without taking into account any potential recoveries from other parties, which are not currently expected).  Puerto Rico Air Emissions Civil Litigation  As previously disclosed, the Company is one of several defendants in a class action suit filed in Superior Court in Puerto Rico relating to air emissions from a government owned and operated wastewater treatment facility. The Court certified the class on August 9, 2007 and on August 15, 2007 the parties executed a global settlement agreement, resolving all claims in the litigation. A hearing to approve the settlement is scheduled for October 26, 2007. Under the terms of the settlement, certain measures, including capital improvements, will be implemented at the wastewater treatment facility to minimize the potential for future odor emissions. The Company’s share of the payment to plaintiffs will be approximately $700,000.    23    Table of Contents Note 18. Subsequent Event  On October 19, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Adnexus Therapeutics, Inc. (Adnexus), developer of a new therapeutic class of biologics called ADNECTINS, for a net purchase price of $415 million, subject to any working capital adjustments. The Company expects to record an in-process research and development charge in the fourth quarter of 2007, estimated to be approximately $230 million. In addition, in the event that certain development and regulatory milestones are achieved, the Company is obligated to pay Adnexus up to an additional $74 million under the terms of the agreement.    24    Table of Contents    Item 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Executive Summary  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS, the Company) is a worldwide pharmaceutical and related health care products company whose mission is to extend and enhance human life by providing the highest quality pharmaceutical and related health care products. The Company is engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals and related health care products.  Financial Highlights  For the third quarter of 2007, the Company reported global net sales of $5.1 billion, a 22% increase over the comparative period in 2006. The comparison of the Company’s largest product by net sales, PLAVIX*, to the third quarter of 2006, reflects the adverse impact of generic competition for PLAVIX* in 2006. Driven by the growth in PLAVIX* and other key products, diluted earnings per share increased 153% to $0.43. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter also included a $0.07 gain on the sale of product assets. During the quarter, the Company generated $0.7 billion of cash from operating activities. The Company also repaid the $1.3 billion outstanding balance of a term facility.  Strategy  The Company continues to execute its strategy for long-term growth and is currently on track with its strategic transition. The Company’s strategy includes the ongoing process of transforming and streamlining itself to maximize the resources that support delivering the full value of its pipeline and portfolio to shareholders. This transformation includes a comprehensive cost reduction program, incremental to current efforts that will include workforce reductions in some areas and the rationalization of some facilities. The Company expects to incur restructuring and other charges in connection with this program. While the amount and timing of these charges cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, the charges are likely to be incurred over the next three years and are reasonably likely to be material.  New Product, Pipeline and Product Developments  In October 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved IXEMPRA (ixabepilone) as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer in patients whose tumors are resistant or refractory to anthracyclines, taxanes and capecitabine. The FDA has also granted approval of IXEMPRA in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer resistant to treatment with an anthracycline, and a taxane, or whose cancer is taxane resistant and for whom further anthracycline therapy is contraindicated. In September 2007, the Company submitted a Marketing Application Authorization (MAA) for ixabepilone to the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA).  In October 2007, ATRIPLA* was approved in Canada as the first once-daily single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. In addition, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMEA issued a positive opinion on the MAA for ATRIPLA*.  In October, 2007, the Company, ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone) and Merck KGaA entered into an agreement for the co-development and co-commercialization of ERBITUX* in Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, the parties will collaborate on a joint effort to develop and market ERBITUX* in Japan for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, as well as for the treatment of other cancers the parties agree to pursue. ERBITUX* was submitted to the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency for approval in February 2007. The Company and Merck KGaA will utilize their respective sales forces in Japan, and the three companies will share development costs, sales and marketing expenses, and profits realized as a result of the agreement.  In October 2007, the Company acquired privately held Adnexus Therapeutics, Inc. (Adnexus), developer of a new therapeutic class of biologics called ADNECTINS. ADNECTINS are a proprietary class of targeted biologics based on a naturally occurring protein found in human serum.  In September 2007, ImClone and the Company announced that a Phase III study of ERBITUX* in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, conducted by Merck KGaA, met its primary endpoint of increasing overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. As previously disclosed, an earlier study conducted by ImClone and the Company evaluating the use of ERBITUX* in combination with a different platinum-based therapy did not meet its primary endpoint of increasing progression free survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Key secondary endpoints of this study, however, were statistically significant and favored the ERBITUX*-containing arm.    25    Table of Contents In September 2007, the FDA approved a sNDA for a single 300mg tablet of PLAVIX*. The 300mg loading dose has been proven effective in a broad acute coronary syndrome patient population. The 300mg tablet of clopidogrel will be available in the U.S. later this year and is also currently under EMEA review.  In August 2007, the European Commission approved an update to the SPRYCEL label to include 100 mg once daily, from 70 mg twice daily, as a starting dose for patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia resistant or intolerant to imatinib. The FDA is reviewing a sNDA on the 100 mg starting dose, with a target action date in mid-November.  In August 2007, the FDA accepted, for filing and review, the supplemental biologics license application for ORENCIA for the treatment of pediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  In August 2007, the Company and Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) finalized the previously disclosed agreement for the worldwide collaboration to research, develop and commercialize DGAT-1 inhibitors. The Company recorded an upfront charge of $60 million in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  The Company remains in discussions with the FDA regarding vinflunine. Based on FDA feedback, the Company does not expect to file a New Drug Application for the treatment of bladder cancer.  Three Months Results of Operations                             Three Months Ended September 30,                          % of Net Sales    Dollars in Millions   2007     2006     % Change     2007     2006     Net Sales   $ 5,050     $ 4,154     22 %           Earnings before Minority Interest and Income Taxes   $ 1,411     $ 617     129 %   27.9 %   14.9 %   Provision for Income Taxes   $ 342     $ 193     77 %           Effective tax rate     24.2 %     31.3 %               Net Earnings   $ 858     $ 338     154 %   17.0 %   8.1 %  Third quarter 2007 net sales increased 22% to $5.1 billion, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact compared to the same period in 2006. U.S. net sales increased 35% to $3.0 billion for the quarter compared to 2006, primarily due to increased PLAVIX* sales, as well as the continued growth of key and newer products. International net sales increased 7% to $2.1 billion, including a 6% favorable foreign exchange impact. The composition of the change in sales is as follows:                              Analysis of % Change     Three Months Ended September 30,    Total Change     Volume     Price     Foreign Exchange     2007 vs. 2006   22 %   15 %   4 %   3 %  In general, the Company’s business is not seasonal.

U.S. pharmaceutical sales increased 42% to $2,302 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $1,619 million in the same period in 2006, primarily due to increased PLAVIX* sales, as well as the continued growth of key products and sales of newer products ORENCIA, BARACLUDE and SPRYCEL.  International pharmaceutical sales increased 6% to $1,624 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $1,535 million in the same period in 2006, due to a favorable 6% foreign exchange impact. Sales growth in ABILIFY* and newer products BARACLUDE and SPRYCEL was offset by increased generic competition for PRAVACHOL and TAXOL® (paclitaxel). The Company’s reported international sales do not include copromotion sales reported by its alliance partner, Sanofi, for PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, which continue to show growth in the third quarter of 2007.    27    Table of Contents Key pharmaceutical products and their sales, representing 81% and 74% of total pharmaceutical sales in the third quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively, are as follows:                     Three Months Ended September 30,    Dollars in Millions   2007   2006   % Change     Cardiovascular               PLAVIX*   $ 1,254   $ 630   99 %   AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*     309     277   12 %   PRAVACHOL     86     192   (55 )%   COUMADIN     50     53   (6 )%   Virology               REYATAZ     273     233   17 %   SUSTIVA Franchise (total revenue)     237     201   18 %   BARACLUDE     72     22   * *   Oncology               ERBITUX*     185     175   6 %   TAXOL® (paclitaxel)      102     137   (26 )%   SPRYCEL     46     11   * *   Affective (Psychiatric) Disorders               ABILIFY* (total revenue)     420     313   34 %   Immunoscience               ORENCIA     60     34   76 %   Other Pharmaceuticals               EFFERALGAN     71     62   15 %    ** In excess of 200%.        •    Sales of PLAVIX*, a platelet aggregation inhibitor that is part of the Company’s alliance with Sanofi, increased 99%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $1,254 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $630 million in the same period in 2006. Sales of PLAVIX* increased 128% in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2007 to $1,080 million from $474 million in the same period in 2006. The comparison to the third quarter 2006 sales reflects the adverse impact of generic competition for PLAVIX* in 2006, which the Company estimates to be in the range of $525 million to $600 million. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand for clopidogrel bisulfate (branded and generic) increased 7% in the third quarter of 2007 compared to 2006. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand for branded PLAVIX* increased 86% in the same period. While market exclusivity for PLAVIX* is expected to expire in 2011 in the U.S. and 2013 in the majority of the European markets, the composition of matter patent for PLAVIX* is the subject of litigation. For additional information on the PLAVIX* litigations, see “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 17. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies.”        •    Sales of AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension, also part of the Sanofi alliance, increased 12%, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $309 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $277 million in the same period in 2006. U.S. sales increased 11% to $176 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $159 million in the same period in 2006, primarily due to higher average net selling prices. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased approximately 4% compared to 2006. International sales increased 13%, including a 7% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $133 million compared to $118 million in the same period in 2006. Market exclusivity for AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (known in the European Union (EU) as APROVEL*/KARVEA*) is expected to expire in 2012 (including pediatric extension) in the U.S. and in countries in the EU; AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* is not currently marketed in Japan.        •    Sales of PRAVACHOL, an HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor, decreased 55%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $86 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $192 million in the same period in 2006, due to increased generic competition in the U.S. and key European markets. Market exclusivity protection expired in April 2006 in the U.S. Market exclusivity in the EU ended in 2004, with the exception of Sweden, where expiration occurred in March 2006, and Italy, where expiration will occur in January 2008. Generic competition in France commenced in July 2006.        •    Sales of COUMADIN, an oral anti-coagulant used predominantly in patients with atrial fibrillation or deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, decreased 6%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $50 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $53 million in the same period in 2006, primarily due to continued competition. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased approximately 15% compared to 2006. Market exclusivity for COUMADIN expired in the U.S. in 1997.    28    Table of Contents     •    Sales of REYATAZ, a protease inhibitor for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), increased 17%, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $273 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $233 million in the same period in 2006. U.S. sales increased 9% to $141 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $129 million in the same period in 2006, primarily due to higher demand. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased approximately 10% compared to 2006. International sales increased 27%, including a 7% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $132 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $104 million in the same period in 2006. Market exclusivity for REYATAZ is expected to expire in 2017 in the U.S., in countries in the EU and in Japan.        •    Sales of the SUSTIVA Franchise, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, increased 18%, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $237 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $201 million in the same period in 2006. U.S. sales increased 18% to $151 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $128 million in the same period in 2006, primarily due to higher demand. Estimated total U.S. prescription growth increased approximately 19% compared to 2006. International sales increased 18%, including an 8% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $86 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $73 million in the same period in 2006. In July 2006, the Company and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) launched ATRIPLA*, a once-daily single tablet three-drug regimen for HIV intended as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Total revenue for the SUSTIVA Franchise includes sales of SUSTIVA as well as revenue from bulk efavirenz included in the combination therapy ATRIPLA*. The Company records revenue for the bulk efavirenz component of ATRIPLA* upon sales of ATRIPLA* by the joint venture with Gilead to third-party customers. The Company has a composition of matter patent that expires in 2013 in the U.S. and in countries in the EU; the Company does not, but others do, market SUSTIVA in Japan. For additional information on revenue recognition of the SUSTIVA Franchise, see “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 2. Alliances and Investments.”        •    Sales of BARACLUDE, an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, increased to $72 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $22 million in the same period in 2006, due to continued growth across all markets. The Company has a composition of matter patent that expires in the U.S. in 2010 and in Japan, Germany, France and the UK in 2011. As previously disclosed, BARACLUDE was launched in China in February 2006. As also previously disclosed, there is uncertainty about China’s exclusivity laws and due to this uncertainty, it is possible that one or more companies in China could receive marketing authorization from China’s health authority as early as the end of 2007.        •    Sales of ERBITUX*, which is sold by the Company almost exclusively in the U.S., increased 6% to $185 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $175 million in the same period in 2006, due to the continued transition to an open distribution model. Erbitux* sales increased 14% in the third quarter of 2007 compared to the second quarter of 2007, due to growth in the use for head and neck cancer as well as the continued rebound of the use for colorectal cancer . ERBITUX* is marketed by the Company under a distribution and copromotion agreement with ImClone. A use patent relating to combination therapy with cytotoxic treatments expires in 2017. There is no patent covering monotherapy. Currently, generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under U.S. law. However, the law could change in the future. Even in the absence of new legislation, the FDA is taking steps toward allowing generic versions of certain biologics. The Company’s right to market ERBITUX* in North America and Japan under its agreement with ImClone expires in September 2018. The Company does not, but others do, market ERBITUX* in countries in the EU. For information on patent litigations relating to ERBITUX*, see “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 17. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data—Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies” in the Company’s 2006 Form 10-K.         •    Sales of TAXOL® (paclitaxel), an anti-cancer agent sold almost exclusively in non-U.S. markets, decreased 26% to $102 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $137 million in the same period in 2006, primarily due to increased generic competition in Europe and Japan during the third quarter of 2006. Market exclusivity protection for TAXOL® (paclitaxel) expired in 2000 in the U.S. and in 2003 in countries in the EU. Two generic paclitaxel products have received regulatory approval in Japan, and both have entered the market.        •    Sales of SPRYCEL, an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases, for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myloid leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including GLEEVEC* (imatinib meslylate), were $46 million for the third quarter of 2007, compared to $11 million in the same period of 2006. The increase was due to launches in international markets beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006 and the continued growth in the U.S. Market exclusivity for SPRYCEL is expected to expire in 2020 in the U.S. and in certain European markets, assuming the pending patents are granted.        •    Total revenue for ABILIFY*, an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute bipolar mania and bipolar disorder, increased 34%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $420 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $313 million in the same period in 2006. U.S. sales increased 27% to $329 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $260 million in the same period in 2006, primarily due to higher demand and higher average net selling prices. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased approximately 10% compared to the same period last year. International sales increased 72%, including a 12% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $91 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $53 million in the same period in 2006, due to continued growth across European markets. Total revenue for ABILIFY*     29    Table of Contents       primarily consists of alliance revenue representing the Company’s 65% share of net sales in countries where it copromotes with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka), and the product is sold by an Otsuka affiliate as a distributor. Otsuka’s market exclusivity protection for ABILIFY* is expected to expire in 2014 in the U.S. (including the granted patent term extension). For information on patent litigations relating to ABILIFY*, see “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 17. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies.” The Company also has the right to copromote ABILIFY* in several European countries (the UK, France, Germany and Spain) and to act as exclusive distributor for the product in the rest of the EU. Market exclusivity protection for ABILIFY* is expected to expire in 2009 for countries in the EU (and may be extended until 2014 if pending supplemental protection certificates are granted). The Company’s contractual right to market ABILIFY* expires in November 2012 in the U.S. and in June 2014 in the countries in the EU where the Company has the exclusive right to market ABILIFY*. For additional information on revenue recognition of ABILIFY*, see “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 2. Alliances and Investments.”        •    Sales of ORENCIA, a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis launched in 2006, increased 76%, including a 1% favorable foreign-exchange impact, to $60 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $34 million in the same period in 2006. The Company has a series of patents covering abatacept and its method of use. The latest of the composition of matter patents expires in the U.S. in 2016. The Company has submitted its request for patent term restoration for one of the composition of matter patents that expires in 2015, which could possibly extend the term of that patent. As noted above, generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under U.S. law, but the law could change in the future.        •    Sales of EFFERALGAN, a formulation of acetaminophen for pain relief sold principally in Europe, increased 15%, including a 8% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $71 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $62 million in the same period in 2006 primarily due to unseasonable weather in 2007.  In most instances, the basic exclusivity loss date indicated above is the expiration date of the patent that claims the active ingredient of the drug or the method of using the drug for the approved indication. In some instances, the basic exclusivity loss date indicated is the expiration date of the data exclusivity period. In situations where there is only data exclusivity without patent protection, a competitor could seek regulatory approval prior to the expiration of the data exclusivity period by submitting its own clinical trial data to obtain marketing approval. The Company assesses the market exclusivity period for each of its products on a case-by-case basis. The length of market exclusivity for any of the Company’s products is difficult to predict with certainty because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity and other factors. There can be no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that the Company currently anticipates. The estimates of market exclusivities reported above are for business planning purposes only and are not intended to reflect the Company’s legal opinion regarding the strength or weakness of any particular patent or other legal position.  The estimated U.S. prescription change data provided above includes information only from the retail and mail order channels and does not reflect information from other channels, such as hospitals, institutions and long-term care, among others. The estimated prescription data is based on the Next-Generation Prescription Services (NGPS) version 2.0 provided by IMS Health (IMS), a supplier of market research for the pharmaceutical industry, as described below.  The Company has calculated the estimated total U.S. prescription change and estimated therapeutic category share based on NGPS version 2.0 data on a weighted-average basis to reflect the fact that mail order prescriptions include a greater volume of product supplied compared to retail prescriptions. Mail order prescriptions typically reflect a 90 day prescription whereas retail prescriptions typically reflect a 30 day prescription. The calculation is derived by multiplying NGPS mail order prescription data by a factor that approximates three and adding to this the NGPS retail prescriptions. The Company believes that this calculation of the estimated total U.S. prescription change and estimated therapeutic category share based on the weighted-average approach with respect to the retail and mail order channels provides a superior estimate of total prescription demand. The Company uses this methodology for its internal demand forecasts.    30    Table of Contents Estimated End-User Demand  U.S. Pharmaceuticals  The following tables set forth for each of the Company’s top 15 pharmaceutical products (based on 2006 annual net sales) sold by the U.S. Pharmaceuticals business, for the three months ended September 30, 2007 compared to the same periods in the prior year: (i) changes in reported U.S. net sales for the period; (ii) estimated total U.S. prescription change for the retail and mail order channels calculated by the Company based on NGPS version 2.0 data on a weighted average basis; and (iii) the estimated U.S. therapeutic category share of the applicable product calculated by the Company based on NGPS version 2.0 data on a weighted-average basis. Prior year prescription data has been adjusted to conform to the NGPS version 2.0 data.

(b) Derived by multiplying NGPS mail order prescription data by a factor that approximates three and adding to this the NGPS retail prescriptions.    (c) The therapeutic categories are determined by the Company as those products considered to be in direct competition with the Company’s own products. The products listed above compete in the following therapeutic categories: ABILIFY* (antipsychotics), AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (angiotensin receptor blockers), BARACLUDE (oral antiviral agent), COUMADIN (warfarin), ERBITUX* (oncology), GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise (oral antidiabetics), KENALOG (intra-articular/intramuscular steroid), ORENCIA (fusion protein), PARAPLATIN (carboplatin), PLAVIX* (antiplatelet agents), PRAVACHOL (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors), REYATAZ and the SUSTIVA Franchise (antiretrovirals—third agents excluding NORVIR* and TRIZIVIR*), SPRYCEL (TKIs for leukemia), and ZERIT (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors).    (d) ERBITUX*, ORENCIA and PARAPLATIN are parenterally administered products and do not have prescription-level data as physicians do not write prescriptions for these products. The Company believes therapeutic category share information provided by third parties for these products may not be reliable and accordingly, none is presented here.    (e) The Company does not have prescription level data because the product is not dispensed through a retail pharmacy. The Company believes therapeutic category share information provided by third parties for this product may not be reliable and accordingly, none is presented here.    (f) REYATAZ and the SUSTIVA Franchise have been recalculated as a percentage share of antiretrovirals – third agents excluding NORVIR* and TRIZIVIR*.    31    Table of Contents   (g) SPRYCEL was launched in the U.S. in July 2006.    (h) SUSTIVA Franchise (total revenue) includes sales of SUSTIVA, as well as revenue of bulk efavirenz included in the combination therapy, ATRIPLA*. The therapeutic category share information and change in U.S. total prescriptions growth for SUSTIVA Franchise (antiretrovirals – third agents excluding NORVIR* and TRIZIVIR*) includes both branded SUSTIVA and ATRIPLA* prescription units.    ** In excess of 200%.  The Company is reporting REYATAZ’s estimated TRx category share within the antiretrovirals—third agents (excluding NORVIR* and TRIZIVIR*) category rather than the protease inhibitors (excluding NORVIR*) category. The Company believes that the antiretrovirals—third agents (excluding NORVIR* and TRIZIVIR*) category more closely reflects the use of protease inhibitors, which has evolved and competes with other products within the antiretrovirals—third agents (excluding NORVIR* and TRIZIVIR*) category. The historical trends of growth in REYATAZ’s estimated TRx category share between the two categories are not materially different.  As previously reported, in July 2007, IMS issued a Product News bulletin announcing that it had revised its previously issued projected prescription and unit volumes for PLAVIX* and Apotex’s generic clopidogrel bisulfate product, which IMS had overstated for the months August 2006 through June 2007 due to market events surrounding the at-risk launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate. Due to these unique circumstances, the high degree of volatility and the compressed timeframe of these events, IMS applied a custom approach to estimate PLAVIX* and generic clopidogrel bisulfate product and market volumes beginning in July 2007.  In October 2007, IMS issued a further Product News bulletin, announcing the discontinuation of the custom approach to estimate PLAVIX* and generic clopidogrel bisulfate product and market volumes in favor of its standard approach beginning October 2007.  The IMS overstatement of PLAVIX* prescription and unit volumes did not impact the Company’s financial results or its reported net sales for PLAVIX* for the quarters ended September 30, 2006, December 31, 2006, March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007.  The following table sets forth the Company’s (i) previously reported estimated prescription change data and estimated therapeutic category share based on National Prescription Audit (NPA) data for the quarters ended September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2006; (ii) previously reported estimated prescription change data and estimated therapeutic category share based on NGPS version 2.0 data for the quarter ended March 31, 2007; and (iii) revised estimated prescription change data and estimated therapeutic category share based on revised NGPS version 2.0 data using the IMS custom approach.

The data provided by IMS are a product of IMS’ own record-keeping processes and are estimates based on IMS’ sampling procedures, subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling and a margin of error.    32    Table of Contents International Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and Other Health Care  As previously disclosed, for the Company’s Pharmaceuticals business outside of the U.S., Nutritionals and Other Health Care business units around the world, the Company has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, the Company relies on a variety of methods to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand for these business units. As such, the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. Pharmaceuticals business for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 is not available prior to the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

The estimated months on hand of the product in the U.S. wholesale distribution channel only include branded SUSTIVA inventory.  In October 2004, the U.S. pediatric exclusivity period for PARAPLATIN expired. The resulting entry of multiple generic competitors for PARAPLATIN led to a significant decrease in demand for PARAPLATIN, which in turn led to the months on hand of the product in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel exceeding one month on hand at September 30, 2007, June 30, 2007, September 30, 2006 and June 30, 2006. The estimated value of PARAPLATIN inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel over one month on hand was approximately $0.1 million at September 30, 2007, $0.3 million at June 30, 2007, $0.6 million at September 30, 2006 and $1.4 million at June 30, 2006. The Company no longer produces PARAPLATIN for the U.S. market and will continue to monitor PARAPLATIN wholesaler inventory levels until they have been depleted.  At September 30, 2006, the estimated value of PLAVIX* inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel exceeded one month on hand by approximately $41.4 million due to the at-risk launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate in August 2006. Because of the large quantities of generic clopidogrel bisulfate shipped into the distribution channels before the preliminary injunction was granted ordering the halt of sales of generic clopidogrel bisulfate in late August 2006, demand for branded PLAVIX* decreased precipitously.  SPRYCEL was launched in the U.S. in July 2006. Consistent with standard practice at the time of a new product launch, the Company’s U.S. wholesalers built inventories of the product to meet expected demand and at September 30, 2006, the estimated value of SPRYCEL inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel exceeded one month on hand by approximately $0.6 million. The Company worked down wholesaler inventory levels to one month on hand or less in the subsequent quarter.    34    Table of Contents For all products other than ERBITUX* and ORENCIA, the Company determines the above months on hand estimates by dividing the estimated amount of the product in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel by the estimated amount of out-movement of the product from the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel over a period of 31 days, all calculated as described below. Factors that may influence the Company’s estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, such estimates are calculated using third-party data, which represent their own record-keeping processes and as such, may also reflect estimates.  The Company maintains inventory management agreements (IMAs) with most of its U.S. Pharmaceuticals wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of total gross sales of U.S. pharmaceutical products. Under the current terms of the IMAs, the Company’s three largest wholesaler customers provide the Company with weekly information with respect to inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement of products. These three wholesalers accounted for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. Pharmaceuticals products in the third quarter of 2007. The inventory information received from these wholesalers excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals, and excludes goods in transit to such wholesalers. The Company uses the information provided by these three wholesalers as of the Friday closest to quarter end to calculate the amount of inventory on hand for these wholesalers at the applicable quarter end. This amount is then increased by the Company’s estimate of goods in transit to these wholesalers based on the Company’s records of sales to these wholesalers, which have not been reflected in the weekly data provided by the wholesalers. Under the Company’s revenue recognition policy, sales are recorded when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred, which in the U.S. Pharmaceuticals business is generally when product is shipped. In such cases, goods in transit to a wholesaler are owned by the applicable wholesaler and, accordingly, are reflected in the calculation of inventories in the wholesaler distribution channel. The Company determines the out-movement of a product from these wholesalers over a period of 31 days by using the most recent four weeks of out-movement of a product as provided by these wholesalers and extrapolating such amount to a 31 day basis. The Company estimates for each product, inventory levels on hand and out-movements for all its U.S. Pharmaceuticals business wholesaler customers, by adjusting the three largest wholesalers’ inventory levels and out-movements by a factor that approximates the other remaining wholesalers’ percentage share of total gross sales for such product in the U.S. In addition, the Company receives inventory information from these other wholesalers on a selective basis for certain key products.  The Company’s U.S. Pharmaceuticals business through the IMAs discussed above, has arrangements with substantially all of its direct wholesaler customers and requires those wholesalers to maintain inventory at levels that are no more than one month of their demand. The Company distributes ORENCIA through distribution arrangements with multiple distributors. The above estimates of months on hand was calculated by dividing the inventories of ORENCIA held by these distributors at the end of the quarter by the out-movement of the product over the last 31 day period, as reported by these distributors. The inventory on hand and out-movements reported by these distributors are a product of the distributors’ own record-keeping processes.  The Company sells ERBITUX* to intermediaries (such as wholesalers and specialty oncology distributors) and ships ERBITUX* directly to the end-users of the product who are the customers of those intermediaries. The Company also sells ERBITUX* to other distributors who then hold ERBITUX* inventory. The above estimate of months on hand was calculated by dividing the inventories of ERBITUX* held by the distributors for their own accounts as reported by the distributors as of the end of the quarter by the out-movements of the product reported by the distributors over the last 31 day period. The inventory levels reported by the distributors are a product of their record-keeping process.   35    Table of Contents Estimated Inventory Months on Hand in the Distribution Channel  The following table, which was posted on the Company’s website and filed on Form 8-K on August 31, 2007, sets forth for each of the Company’s key products sold by the businesses listed below, the net sales of the applicable product for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2007, March 31, 2007, June 30, 2006 and March 31, 2006, and the estimated number of months on hand of the applicable product in the direct customer distribution channel for the business as of the end of each of the four quarters. The estimates of months on hand for key products described below for the International Pharmaceuticals business are based on data collected for all of the Company’s significant business units outside of the U.S. Also described further below is information on non-key product(s) where the amount of inventory on hand at direct customers is more than approximately one month and the impact is not de minimis. For the other non-Pharmaceuticals reporting segments, estimates are based on data collected for the U.S. and all significant business units outside of the U.S.                             June 30, 2007   March 31, 2007   June 30, 2006   March 31, 2006  (Dollars in Millions)   Net Sales    Months on Hand   Net Sales    Months on Hand   Net Sales    Months on Hand   Net Sales    Months on Hand   International Pharmaceuticals                            ABILIFY* (total revenue)   $ 90   0.6   73   0.6   57   0.6   52   0.6   AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*     127   0.5   107   0.5   113   0.5   94   0.5   BARACLUDE     39   0.7   28   0.7   5   1.0   2   1.1   BUFFERIN*     27   0.5   24   0.5   31   0.5   22   0.6   CAPOTEN     25   0.9   26   0.8   31   0.9   35   0.8   DAFALGAN     42   1.4   44   1.2   37   1.1   37   1.4   EFFERALGAN     69   1.4   81   1.1   62   0.9   68   1.2   MAXIPIME     39   0.8   29   0.5   43   0.8   40   0.8   MONOPRIL     42   1.2   36   0.8   48   1.1   46   1.1   ORENCIA     2   0.4   1   0.3   —    —    —    —    PERFALGAN     65   0.5   58   0.5   51   0.6   46   0.6   PLAVIX*     174   0.6   151   0.5   157   0.5   136   0.5   PRAVACHOL     85   0.6   78   0.6   195   1.4   234   1.5   REYATAZ     116   0.7   120   0.9   114   0.7   88   0.6   SPRYCEL     21   0.4   11   0.4   —    —    —    —    SUSTIVA Franchise (a) (total revenue)     86   0.5   82   0.5   78   0.5   67   0.5   TAXOL® (paclitaxel)      91   0.6   107   0.7   145   0.5   143   0.6   VIDEX/VIDEX EC     27   1.1   27   1.1   35   1.2   31   0.8   Nutritionals                            ENFAMIL/ENFAGROW     337   0.9   326   0.8   312   0.9   304   0.9   NUTRAMIGEN     54   1.0   52   0.9   54   1.0   48   1.0   Other Health Care                            ConvaTec                            Ostomy     150   0.9   130   0.9   141   1.0   123   0.9   Wound Therapeutics     119   0.9   107   0.9   107   0.9   98   0.9   Medical Imaging                            CARDIOLITE     106   0.7   99   0.7   105   0.8   103   0.8    (a) Beginning in the third quarter of 2006, the SUSTIVA Franchise includes sales of SUSTIVA, as well as revenue of bulk efavirenz included in the combination therapy, ATRIPLA*. The estimated months on hand of the product in the distribution channel only include branded SUSTIVA inventory.  The above months on hand information represents the Company’s estimates of aggregate product level inventory on hand at direct customers divided by the expected demand for the applicable product. Expected demand is the estimated ultimate patient/consumer demand calculated based on estimated end-user consumption or direct customer out-movement data over the most recent 31 day period or other reasonable period. Factors that may affect the Company’s estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, direct customer purchases in light of price increases, new product or product presentation launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations.  The Company relies on a variety of methods to calculate months on hand for these businesses and reporting segments. Where available, the Company relies on information provided by third parties to determine estimates of aggregate product level inventory on hand at direct customers and expected demand. For the businesses and reporting segments listed above, however, the Company has limited information on direct customer product level inventory, end-user consumption and direct customer out-movement data. Further, the quality of third party information, where available, varies widely. In some circumstances, such as the case with new products or seasonal products, such historical end-user consumption or out-movement information may not be available or applicable. In such cases, the Company uses estimated prospective demand. In cases where direct customer product level inventory, ultimate     36    Table of Contents  patient/consumer demand or out-movement data do not exist or are otherwise not available, the Company has developed a variety of other methodologies to calculate estimates of such data, including using such factors as historical sales made to direct customers and third party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand.  As of March 31, 2006, BARACLUDE, an oral antiviral agent, had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers. The level of inventory on hand is due primarily to stocking of the product in support of its recent launch in China.  As of June 30, 2007, March 31, 2007, June 30, 2006 and March 31, 2006, DAFALGAN, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had approximately 1.4, 1.2, 1.1 and 1.4 months of inventory on hand, respectively, at direct customers. The level of inventory on hand was due primarily to private pharmacists purchasing DAFALGAN approximately once every eight weeks and the seasonality of the product.  As of June 30, 2007, March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, EFFERALGAN, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had approximately 1.4, 1.1 and 1.2 months of inventory on hand, respectively, at direct customers. The level of inventory on hand is due primarily to private pharmacists purchasing EFFERALGAN approximately once every eight weeks and the seasonality of the product.  As of June 30, 2007, June 30, 2006 and March 31, 2006, MONOPRIL, a cardiovascular product, had approximately 1.2, 1.1 and 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers. The level of inventory on hand as of June 30, 2007, is due primarily to initial stocking of a new, exclusive distributor in Poland and stocking in support of the launch of MONOPRIL in Poland in 2007. The level of inventory on hand as of June 30, 2006 and March 31, 2006, was due primarily to supply of the product in support of its inclusion in a government program in Russia.  As of June 30, 2006 and March 31, 2006, PRAVACHOL, a cardiovascular product, had approximately 1.4 and 1.5 months of inventory on hand, respectively, at direct customers. The increased level of inventory on hand was due primarily to an increase in orders from a significant direct customer in France.  As of June 30, 2007, March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2006, VIDEX/VIDEX EC, an antiviral product, had approximately 1.1, 1.1 and 1.2 months of inventory on hand, respectively, at direct customers. The increased level of inventory on hand is due primarily to government purchasing patterns in Brazil. The Company is contractually obligated to provide VIDEX/VIDEX EC to the Brazilian government upon placement of an order for product by the government. Under the terms of the contract, the Company has no control over the inventory levels relating to such orders.  The Company continuously seeks to improve the quality of its estimates of months on hand of inventories held by its direct customers including thorough review of its methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and review and analysis of its own and third parties’ data used in such calculations. The Company expects that it will continue to review and refine its methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and will continue to review and analyze its own and third parties’ data in such calculations. The Company also has and will continue to take steps to expedite the receipt and processing of data for the non-U.S. Pharmaceuticals business.    37    Table of Contents HEALTH CARE GROUP  The combined third quarter 2007 revenues from the Health Care Group increased 12%, including a 4% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $1.1 billion compared to the same period in 2006.

Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa increased 6%, including a 7% favorable foreign exchange impact. Sales increased in major European markets for PLAVIX*, REYATAZ, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, BARACLUDE and ABILIFY*. The sales increase was offset by the increased generic competition for PRAVACHOL and TAXOL® (paclitaxel).  Sales in the Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 11%, including a 5% favorable foreign exchange impact, primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* and ENFAMIL in Canada and Mexico.  Sales in the Pacific region increased 7%, including a 5% favorable foreign exchange impact, primarily due to increased sales of BARACLUDE in China, Japan and Korea as well as Nutritional products primarily in Philippines, Thailand and China, partially offset by lower sales of TAXOL® (paclitaxel) in Japan due to generic competition.

The margin improvement was due primarily to impairment charges in 2006 in addition to sales growth of higher margin products in 2007.        •    Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2% to $1,214 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006, primarily due to foreign exchange impact.        •    Advertising and product promotion spending increased 23% to $351 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $286 million in the same period in 2006, driven primarily by increased spending for direct-to-consumer advertising for PLAVIX* and ABILIFY*, as well as investments to support the launch of IXEMPRA.        •    Research and development expenses increased 9% to $827 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $756 million in the same period in 2006. This increase primarily reflects higher licensing up-front payments and continued investments in late-stage compounds, partially offset by sharing of codevelopment costs with alliance partners AstraZeneca PLC and Pfizer. The third quarter 2007 upfront payment relates to the agreement with Pfizer. Research and development spending dedicated to pharmaceutical products decreased to 19.8% of pharmaceutical sales in the third quarter of 2007, compared to 22.2% in the same period in 2006, primarily due to increased net sales in 2007.    39    Table of Contents     •    Restructuring activities implemented in the third quarter of 2007 and 2006 by the Company are expected to generate annual benefit to earnings before minority interest and income taxes of approximately $6 million and $11 million, respectively. For additional information on restructuring, see “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 3. Restructuring.”        •    Litigation income of $9 million in the third quarter of 2006 was related to an insurance recovery for a previously settled litigation matter. For additional information on litigation charges, see “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 17. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies—Pricing, Sales and Promotional Practices Litigation and Investigations.”        •    The gain on sale of product assets of $247 million in 2007 was for the sale of the BUFFERIN* and EXCEDRIN* brands in Japan.        •    Equity in net income of affiliates for the third quarter of 2007 was $139 million, compared to $118 million in the third quarter of 2006. Equity in net income of affiliates is principally related to the Company’s international joint venture with Sanofi and investment in ImClone. The $21 million increase in equity in net income of affiliates is primarily due to increased net income in the Sanofi joint venture, partially offset by a net loss from the equity investments in ImClone in 2007 compared with net income in 2006. For additional information on equity in net income of affiliates, see “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 2. Alliances and Investments.”        •    Other expense/(income), net, was expense of $11 million in the third quarter of 2007, compared to income of $34 million in the third quarter of 2006. Other expense, net, includes net interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, income from third-party contract manufacturing, certain royalty income and expense, gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment, certain other litigation matters, insurance recoveries and deferred income recognized. The $45 million change in other expense/income, net, in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to the reversal of accruals with respect to the potential payments under the proposed settlement with Apotex recorded in 2006 and net unfavorability in foreign exchange movements in 2007, partially offset by lower net interest expense. For additional information, see “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 6. Other Expense/(Income), Net.”  During the quarters ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded specified expense/(income) items that affected the comparability of results of the periods presented herein, which are set forth in the following tables:  Three Months Ended September 30, 2007                          Dollars in Millions   Cost ofproducts sold   Researchanddevelopment   Gain on saleof productassets      Other(income)/ expense,net     Total     Litigation Matters:                          Insurance recovery   $ —    $ —    $ —      $ (11 )   $ (11 )   Product liability     —      —      —        5       5                                               —      —      —        (6 )     (6 )          Other:                          Upfront and milestone payments     —      60     —        —        60     Accelerated depreciation and asset impairment     17     —      —        —        17     Gain on sale of product assets     —      —      (247 )     —        (247 )                                           $ 17   $ 60   $ (247 )   $ (6 )     (176 )                                      Income taxes on items above                       82                                 (Increase)/Decrease to Net Earnings                     $ (94 )                                40    Table of Contents Three Months Ended September 30, 2006                             Dollars in Millions   Cost ofproducts sold   Research anddevelopment   Provision forrestructuring, net   Litigationincome, net     Other(income)/expense,net     Total     Litigation Matters:                              Insurance recovery   $ —    $ —    $ —    $ (9 )   $ —      $ (9 )   Product liability     —      —      —      —        11       11     Commercial litigation     —      —      —      —        (40 )     (40 )                                                   —      —      —      (9 )     (29 )     (38 )           Other:                              Accelerated depreciation     72     —      —      —        —        72     Downsizing and streamlining of worldwide operations     —      —      2     —        —        2     Upfront and milestone payments     —      17     —      —        —        17                                                   $ 72   $ 17   $ 2   $ (9 )   $ (29 )     53                                              Income taxes on items above                           (5 )   Minority interest, net of taxes                           13     Change in estimate for taxes on prior year items                           39                                     (Increase)/Decrease to Net Earnings                         $ 100                                    Earnings Before Minority Interest and Income Taxes                      Earnings Before Minority Interestand Income Taxes        Three Months Ended September 30,    Dollars in Millions   2007   2006     % Change     Pharmaceuticals   $ 977   $ 498     96 %        Nutritionals     196     161     22 %   Other Health Care     140     129     9 %                       Health Care Group     336     290     16 %                            Total segments     1,313     788     67 %   Corporate/Other     98     (171 )   157 %                       Total   $ 1,411   $ 617     129 %                      In the third quarter of 2007, earnings before minority interest and income taxes increased 129% to $1,411 million from $617 million in the third quarter of 2006. The increase was primarily driven by the net impact of items that affect the comparability of results as discussed above, strong sales growth of key brands, increased PLAVIX* sales, increase in equity in net income of affiliates and lower net interest expense, partially offset by increased investment in advertising, product promotion and research and development.  PHARMACEUTICALS  Earnings before minority interest and income taxes increased to $977 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $498 million in the third quarter of 2006 primarily due to increased PLAVIX* sales, strong sales growth of other key brands, improved gross margins and increase in equity in net income of affiliates, partially offset by continued investment in research and development, including upfront payments, as well as in advertising and product promotion.  HEALTH CARE GROUP  Nutritionals  Earnings before minority interest and income taxes increased to $196 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $161 million in the third quarter of 2006 primarily due to growth of key products and improved gross margins, partially offset by increased investment in advertising and product promotion.  Other Health Care  Earnings before minority interest and income taxes increased to $140 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $129 million in the third quarter of 2006, primarily due to lower operating expenses in Medical Imaging resulting from restructuring actions implemented in prior periods.    41    Table of Contents CORPORATE / OTHER  Earnings before minority interest and income taxes were $98 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared to a loss of $171 million in the third quarter of 2006. The increase was primarily due to gain on sale of the BUFFERIN* and EXCEDRIN* brands in Japan and lower net interest expense.  Income Taxes  The effective income tax rate on earnings before minority interest and income taxes was 24.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2007 compared to 31.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2006. The lower tax rate in the three months ended September 30, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 was primarily due to the re-enactment of the U.S. Research and Development tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2006 applicable to 2007, an unfavorable change in estimate on uncertain tax benefits related to the deductibility of litigation settlement expenses and lower tax benefits associated with certain restructuring expenses, both in 2006. This was partially offset by the unfavorable impact in 2007 related to the gain on sale of the BUFFERIN* and EXCEDRIN* brands.  Minority Interest  Minority interest, net of taxes increased to $211 million in 2007 from $86 million in 2006, primarily due to higher earnings resulting from increased PLAVIX* sales.  Nine Months Results of Operations  Except as noted below, the factors affecting the third quarter comparisons all affected the nine month comparisons.

U.S. net sales increased 8% to $8.3 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 while international sales increased 2%, including a 5% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $6.2 billion.

Medicaid rebates decreased primarily due to lower utilization for PLAVIX*. Sales returns decreased primarily due to higher accruals in 2006 for Cardiovascular non-exclusive brands and from the discontinued commercialization of TEQUIN.

Acquisitions and Divestitures.”        •    Equity in net income of affiliates for the first nine months of 2007 was $393 million, compared with $336 million in the first nine months of 2006. The $57 million increase is primarily due to increased net income in the Sanofi joint venture, partially offset by decreased net income from the equity investment in ImClone. For additional information on equity in net income of affiliates, see “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 2. Alliances and Investments.”        •    Other expense, net was $33 million and $59 million in the first nine months of 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $26 million decrease in other expense, net in 2007 from 2006 was primarily due to lower net interest expense and the recognition of deferred income related to upfront payments received from alliance partners, partially offset by net unfavorability in foreign exchange movements.

The increase was primarily driven by the net impact of items that affect the comparability of results as discussed above, strong sales growth of key brands, increased PLAVIX* sales and an increase in equity in net income of affiliates, partially offset by investment in advertising and product promotion and higher research and development expenses.  PHARMACEUTICALS  Earnings before minority interest and income taxes increased 23% to $2,807 million in the first nine months of 2007 from $2,277 million in the first nine months of 2006 primarily due to strong sales growth of key brands, increased PLAVIX* sales, improved gross margins and increase in net income of affiliates, partially offset by continued investment in research and development, including upfront payments, and investment in advertising and product promotion.  HEALTH CARE GROUP  Nutritionals  Earnings before minority interest and income taxes increased to $536 million in the first nine months of 2007 from $531 million in the first nine months of 2006. This increase was due to growth of key products and improved gross margins, partially offset by increased investment in advertising and product promotion and the establishment of an allowance for a doubtful account in 2007.  Other Health Care  Earnings before minority interest and income taxes increased to $436 million in the first nine months of 2007 from $381 million in the first nine months of 2006. This increase was due to higher ConvaTec sales and lower operating expenses in Medical Imaging resulting from restructuring actions implemented in previous periods.  CORPORATE/OTHER  Loss before minority interest and income taxes was $294 million in the first nine months of 2007 compared to $269 million in the first nine months of 2006. The 2007 and 2006 results included gains on sale of product assets of $273 million and $200 million, respectively. The additional difference was primarily due to insurance recovery for previously settled litigation matters and income from a commercial litigation, both in 2006.    49    Table of Contents Income Taxes  The effective income tax rate on earnings before minority interest and income taxes was 19.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared to 26.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $105 million in the first quarter of 2007 due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to the deductibility of litigation settlement expenses and U.S. foreign tax credits claimed. In addition, the lower tax rate in the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 was due to the re-enactment of the U.S. Research and Development tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2006. The nine months ended September 30, 2006 was also unfavorably impacted by the change in estimate on prior year uncertain tax benefits related to the deductibility of litigation settlement expenses.  Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately $3.6 billion at September 30, 2007 and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2006. The Company continues to maintain a sufficient level of working capital, which was approximately $2.5 billion at September 30, 2007 and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2006. In 2007 and future periods, the Company expects cash generated by its U.S. operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures (which the Company expects to include substantial investments in facilities to increase and maintain the Company’s capacity to provide biologics on a commercial scale), milestone payments and dividends paid in the U.S. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, the conversion of other working-capital items and borrowings are expected to fund near-term operations outside the U.S.  Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2007 primarily consisted of U.S. dollar denominated bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Marketable securities at September 30, 2007 primarily consisted of U.S. dollar denominated floating rate instruments with a ‘AAA/aaa’ credit rating. Due to the nature of these instruments, the Company considers it reasonable to expect that their fair market values will not be significantly impacted by a change in interest rates, and that they can be liquidated for cash at short notice.  As previously disclosed, in September 2006, the Company and Sanofi each posted $200 million towards a $400 million bond with the District court as collateral in support of the preliminary injunction issued on August 31, 2006. This collateral was reported as marketable securities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the outcome of the PLAVIX* patent litigation on June 21, 2007, the District court ordered release of the $400 million bond and release of the issuer of the bond from any liability in connection with the bond. As such, the Company’s obligations under the collateral arrangements with respect to the bond were effectively terminated.  Short-term borrowings were $1.9 billion at September 30, 2007, compared to $187 million at December 31, 2006. The $108 million of 1.10% Yen Notes, due 2008, was reclassified from long-term debt to short-term borrowings in the first quarter of 2007. The $31 million of 1.43% Yen Notes, due 2008, the $400 million of 4.00% Notes, due 2008, and the $1.2 billion of Floating Rate Convertible Debentures, due 2023 (with a 2008 put/call), were reclassified from long-term debt to short-term borrowings in 2007. The Company maintains cash balances and short-term investments in excess of short-term borrowings.  Long-term debt was $4.2 billion at September 30, 2007 compared to $7.2 billion at December 31, 2006. The remaining $1.3 billion Floating Rate Bank Term Facility, due 2010, was fully repaid and cancelled in the third quarter of 2007. In addition, as noted above, certain long-term debts were reclassified to short term borrowings.  The Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) long-term and short-term credit ratings for the Company are currently A2 and Prime-1, respectively. Moody’s long-term credit rating remains on stable outlook. Standard & Poor’s (S&P) long-term and short-term credit ratings for the Company are currently A+ and A-1, respectively. S&P long-term credit rating remains on stable outlook. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) long-term and short-term credit ratings for the Company are currently A+ and F1, respectively. Fitch revised its long-term credit rating outlook to stable from negative.    50    Table of Contents The following is a discussion of working capital:              Dollars in Millions   September 30,2007   December 31,2006   Working capital   $ 2,543   $ 3,806  The decrease in working capital of $1.3 billion from December 31, 2006 to September 30, 2007 was impacted by:        •    An increase in short-term borrowings from long-term debt due to the reclassification as noted above.        •    An increase in inventories due to the timing of raw material purchases and increased production for certain products in anticipation of rationalization of the Company’s manufacturing network.        •    Increased accrued royalties resulting from increased PLAVIX* sales.        •    Reclassification of certain tax contingencies from current U.S. and foreign income taxes payable to non-current upon the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 on January 1, 2007.        •    Higher receivables primarily due to increased PLAVIX* sales.  The following is a discussion of cash flow activities:                    Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,    Dollars in Millions   2007     2006     Cash flow provided by/(used in):             Operating activities   $ 2,523     $ 1,872     Investing activities     (236 )     (534 )   Financing activities     (2,689 )     (1,576 )  Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,523 million in 2007 and $1,872 million in 2006. The $651 million positive cash flow variance is mainly attributable to net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $674 million and by higher net earnings of $535 million, partially offset by lower net changes in adjustments to net earnings of $558 million.  Net negative changes in adjustments to net earnings in 2007 compared to 2006, of $558 million, mainly included:        •    A $413 million negative cash flow variance in the deferred income tax (benefit)/expense. The 2007 adjustments included the deferred tax benefits from upfront cash receipts from alliance partners and the resolution of an audit issue with the IRS, partially offset by the litigation payments. The 2006 adjustments included deferred tax charges for the payment of litigation settlements and the utilization of foreign tax credits related to the revocation of section 936 election for a domestic subsidiary.  Net positive changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2007 compared to 2006, of $674 million, mainly included:        •    A $875 million positive cash flow variance from accounts payable and accrued expenses is primarily due to higher purchases of raw materials, a significant pay down of payables in early 2006 resulting from lower payment of invoices in December 2005, an increase in accrued royalties in 2007 resulting from increased PLAVIX* sales and a reduction of accrued rebates and returns in the first quarter of 2006 primarily resulting from lower sales volume.        •    A $867 million negative cash flow variance from receivables primarily due to increased PLAVIX* sales in 2007 and lower collection in 2007 resulting from lower PRAVACHOL sales.        •    A $350 million positive cash flow variance in deferred income and other liabilities mainly due to $350 million of upfront cash receipts from alliance partners in 2007.        •    A $239 million positive cash flow variance in income taxes payable primarily due to a refund claim related to the revocation of section 936 election for a domestic subsidiary and the expected utilization of certain foreign tax credits, both in 2006.  Net cash used in investing activities was $236 million in 2007 and $534 million in 2006. The $298 million positive cash flow variance is primarily attributable to:        •    A $280 million positive cash flow variance from licensing milestone payments in 2006 to ImClone and Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Net cash used in financing activities was $2,689 million in 2007 and $1,576 million in 2006. The $1,113 million negative cash flow variance is mainly attributable to:        •    A $1.3 billion negative cash flow variance due to the repayment of the remaining $1.3 billion Floating Rate Bank Facility due 2010.        •    A $144 million positive cash flow variance mainly from higher cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2007 compared to 2006.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company did not purchase any of its common stock.    51    Table of Contents For each of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, dividends declared per common share were $.28 and $.84, respectively. The Company paid $556 million and $1,659 million in dividends for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007, respectively, and $551 million and $1,649 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006, respectively. Dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by the Board of Directors (the Board).  Contractual Obligations  For a discussion of the Company’s contractual obligations, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’ in the Company’s 2006 Form 10-K. In the first nine months of 2007, the Company committed an additional $254 million over the next six to seven years for the extension of two administrative contracts and $157 million for a new six year research and development contract.  SEC Consent Order  As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, the Company entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004.  Under the terms of the Consent, the Company agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to its direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. The Company also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that it has implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer the Company’s accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that the Company’s budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just those that come from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process.  The Company has established a company-wide policy to limit its sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent. This policy includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis.  The Company maintains IMAs with most of its U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers that account for nearly 100% of total gross sales of U.S. pharmaceutical products. Under the current terms of the IMAs, the Company’s three largest wholesaler customers provide the Company with weekly information with respect to months on hand product level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. These three wholesalers currently account for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. pharmaceutical products in the third quarter of 2007, as well as 2006 and 2005. The inventory information received from these wholesalers, together with the Company’s internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. The Company estimates months on hand product inventory levels for its U.S. Pharmaceuticals business’s wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. In contrast, for the Company’s Pharmaceutical business outside of the U.S., Nutritionals and Other Health Care business units around the world, the Company has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, the Company relies on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units.  The Company believes the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent.  Critical Accounting Policies  For a discussion of the Company’s critical accounting policies, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s 2006 Form 10-K.    52    Table of Contents Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements the Company makes from time to time contain certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as “should”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “target”, “may”, “project”, “guidance”, “intend”, “plan”, “believe” and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, the Company’s goals, plans and projections regarding its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. The Company has included important factors in the cautionary statements included in its 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007, and in this quarterly report, particularly under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, that the Company believes could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement.  Although the Company believes it has been prudent in its plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.    53    Table of Contents    Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  For a discussion of the Company’s market risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in the Company’s 2006 Form 10-K.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2007, the Company purchased $96 million notional amount of put options and sold $439 million notional amount of forward contracts (in several currencies) to partially hedge the exchange impact primarily related to forecasted intercompany inventory purchases for up to the next 15 months. In addition, the Company purchased $107 million notional amount of put options and sold $73 million notional amount of forward contracts (in several currencies) to partially hedge other forecasted currency exposures. Furthermore, the Company sold a net $323 million notional amount of forward contracts to hedge the exchange impact related to primarily Japanese Yen denominated third party receivables.       Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Management of the Company, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are effective.    54    Table of Contents  PART II—OTHER INFORMATION       Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  Information pertaining to legal proceedings can be found in “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 17. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies,” to the interim consolidated financial statements, and is incorporated by reference herein.       Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2007, except for the following:  Failure to execute the Company’s business strategy could adversely impact its growth and profitability.  As part of its strategy, the Company currently is implementing a comprehensive cost reduction program, incremental to current efforts that will include workforce reductions in some areas and the rationalization of some facilities. The Company expects to incur restructuring and other charges in connection with this program. While the amount and timing of these charges cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, the charges are likely to be incurred over the next three years and are reasonably likely to be material.    55    Table of Contents    Item 2.
