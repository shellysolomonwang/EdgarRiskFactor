Item 1A. Risk Factors      We are substantially dependent on revenues from our two principal products     Our current and future revenues depend substantially upon continued sales of our two principal products, AVONEX and RITUXAN, which represented approximately 88% of our total revenues in 2007. Any significant negative developments relating to these two products, such as safety or efficacy issues, the introduction or greater acceptance of competing products (including greater than anticipated substitution of TYSABRI for AVONEX) or adverse regulatory or legislative developments, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Although we have developed and continue to develop additional products for commercial introduction, we expect to be substantially dependent on sales from these two products for many years. A decline in sales from either of these two products would adversely affect our business.     Our near-term success depends on the market acceptance and successful sales growth of TYSABRI     A substantial portion of our growth in the near-term is dependent on anticipated sales of TYSABRI. TYSABRI is expected to diversify our product offerings and revenues, and to drive additional revenue growth over the next several years. If we are not successful in growing sales of TYSABRI, that would result in a significant reduction in diversification and expected revenues, and adversely affect our business.     Achievement of anticipated sales growth of TYSABRI will depend upon its acceptance by the medical community and patients, which cannot be certain given the significant restrictions on use and the significant safety warnings in the label. Additional cases of the known side effect PML at a higher rate than indicated in    33    Table of Contents   the prescribing information, or the occurrence of other unexpected side effects could harm acceptance and limit TYSABRI sales. Any significant lack of acceptance of TYSABRI by the medical community or patients would materially and adversely affect our growth and our plans for the future.     As a relatively new entrant to a maturing MS market, TYSABRI sales may be more sensitive to additional new competing products. A number of such products are expected to be approved for use in MS in the coming years. If these products have a similar or more attractive overall profile in terms of efficacy, convenience and safety, future sales of TYSABRI could be limited.     Our business could be negatively affected as a result of a threatened proxy fight and other actions of activist shareholders     We received a notice from Icahn Partners and certain of its affiliates nominating three individuals for election to our Board of Directors at the 2008 annual meeting and proposing to amend our bylaws to set the number of directors at twelve. If a proxy contest results from this notice, our business could be adversely affected because:              •   Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees;         •   Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential acquisitions, collaborations or in-licensing opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and         •   If individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders.       These actions could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.     Our long-term success depends upon the successful development and commercialization of other products from our research and development activities     Our long-term viability and growth will depend upon the successful development and commercialization of other products from our research and development activities. Product development and commercialization are very expensive and involve a high degree of risk. Only a small number of research and development programs result in the commercialization of a product. Success in early stage clinical trials or preclinical work does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful. Even if later stage clinical trials are successful, the risk remains that unexpected concerns may arise from additional data or analysis or that obstacles may arise or issues may be identified in connection with review of clinical data with regulatory authorities or that regulatory authorities may disagree with our view of the data or require additional data or information or additional studies.     Conducting clinical trials is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. Our ability to complete our clinical trials in a timely fashion depends in large part on a number of key factors including protocol design, regulatory and institutional review board approval, the rate of patient enrollment in clinical trials, and compliance with extensive current good clinical practice requirements. We have recently opened clinical sites and are enrolling patients in a number of new countries where our experience is more limited, and we are in many cases using the services of third-party contract clinical trial providers. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and regulatory aspects of our large, complex and diverse clinical trials, our studies and ultimately our regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates altogether.    34    Table of Contents   Adverse safety events can negatively affect our assets, product sales, operations and products in development     Even after we receive marketing approval for a product, adverse event reports may have a negative impact on our commercialization efforts. Our voluntary withdrawal of TYSABRI from the market in February 2005 following reports of cases of PML resulted in a significant reduction in expected revenues as well as significant expense and management time required to address the legal and regulatory issues arising from the withdrawal, including revised labeling and enhanced risk management programs. Later discovery of safety issues with our products that were not known at the time of their approval by the FDA could cause product liability events, additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling, withdrawal of products from the market and the imposition of fines or criminal penalties. Any of these actions could result in, among other things, material write-offs of inventory and impairments of intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets.     If we fail to compete effectively, our business and market position would suffer     The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive. We compete in the marketing and sale of our products, the development of new products and processes, the acquisition of rights to new products with commercial potential and the hiring and retention of personnel. We compete with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that have a greater number of products on the market, greater financial and other resources and other technological or competitive advantages. We cannot be certain that one or more of our competitors will not receive patent protection that dominates, blocks or adversely affects our product development or business, will not benefit from significantly greater sales and marketing capabilities, or will not develop products that are accepted more widely than ours. The introduction of alternatives to our products that offer advantages in efficacy, safety or ease of use could negatively affect our revenues and reduce the value of our product development efforts. In addition, potential governmental action in the future could provide a means for competition from developers of follow-on biologics, which could compete on price and differentiation with products that we now or could in the future market.     In addition to competing directly with products that are marketed by substantial pharmaceutical competitors, AVONEX, RITUXAN and TYSABRI also face competition from off-label uses of drugs approved for other indications. Some of our current competitors are also working to develop alternative formulations for delivery of their products, which may in the future compete with ours.     We depend on collaborators for both product and royalty revenue and the clinical development of future collaboration products, which are outside of our full control     Collaborations between companies on products or programs are a common business practice in the biotechnology industry. Out-licensing typically allows a partner to collect up front payments and future milestone payments, share the costs of clinical development and risk of failure at various points, and access sales and marketing infrastructure and expertise in exchange for certain financial rights to the product or program going to the in-licensing partner. In addition, the obligation of in-licensees to pay royalties or share profits generally terminates upon expiration of the related patents. We have a number of collaborators and partners, and have both in-licensed and out-licensed several products and programs. These collaborations include several risks:              •   we are not fully in control of the royalty or profit sharing revenues we receive from collaborators, and we cannot be certain of the timing or potential impact of factors including patent expirations, pricing or health care reforms, other legal and regulatory developments, failure of our partners to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements, the introduction of competitive products, and new indication approvals which may affect the sales of collaboration products;         •   where we copromote and co-market products with our collaboration partners, any failure on their part to comply with applicable laws in the sale and marketing of our products could have an adverse effect on our revenues as well as involve us in possible legal proceedings; and      35    Table of Contents              •   collaborations often require the parties to cooperate, and failure to do so effectively could have an impact on product sales by our collaborators and partners, as well as an impact on the clinical development of shared products or programs under joint control.       In addition, the successful development and commercialization of new anti-CD20 product candidates in our collaboration with Genentech (which also includes RITUXAN) will decrease our participation in the operating profits from the collaboration (including as to RITUXAN).     We depend, to a significant extent, on reimbursement from third party payors and a reduction in the extent of reimbursement could negatively affect our product sales and revenue     Sales of our products are dependent, in large part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. U.S. and foreign government regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations.     In the U.S., at both the federal and state levels, the government regularly proposes legislation to reform healthcare and its cost, any of which may impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products. In the last few years, there have been a number of legislative changes that have affected the reimbursement for our products, including, but not limited to, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and most recently, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The Deficit Reduction Act made significant changes to the Medicaid prescription drug provisions of the Social Security Act, including changes that impose the monthly reporting of price information and that may have an impact on the Medicaid rebates we pay. In addition, states may more aggressively seek Medicaid rebates as a result of legislation enacted in 2006, which rebate activity could adversely affect our results of operations.     Pricing pressures in the U.S. may increase as a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Managed care organizations as well as Medicaid and other government health administration authorities continue to seek price discounts. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may continue to increase the use of managed care organizations. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices and reimbursement for our products. In addition, some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or patient-access constraints under the Medicaid program and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid eligible. Other matters also could be the subject of U.S. federal or state legislative or regulatory action that could adversely affect our business, including the importation of prescription drugs that are marketed outside the U.S. and sold at lower prices as a result of drug price limitations imposed by the governments of various foreign countries.     We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. In the EU and some other international markets, the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored health care system. This international patchwork of price regulations may lead to inconsistent prices. Within the EU and other countries, some third party trade in our products occurs from markets with lower prices thereby undermining our sales in some markets with higher prices. Additionally, certain countries reference the prices in other countries where our products are marketed. Thus, inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may also impair our ability to obtain acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets. This may create the opportunity for the third party cross border trade previously mentioned or our decision not to sell the product thus affecting our geographic expansion plans.     When a new medical product is approved, the availability of government and private reimbursement for that product is uncertain, as is the amount for which that product will be reimbursed. We cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for our product candidates.    36    Table of Contents   If we do not successfully execute our strategy of growth through the acquisition, partnering and in-licensing of products, technologies or companies, our future performance could be adversely affected     In addition to the expansion of our pipeline through spending on internal development projects, we plan to grow through external growth opportunities, which include the acquisition, partnering and in-licensing of products, technologies and companies or the entry into strategic alliances and collaborations. If we are unable to complete or manage these external growth opportunities successfully, we will not be able to grow our business in the way that we currently expect. The availability of high quality opportunities is limited and we are not certain that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or complete transactions on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, even if we are able to successfully identify and complete acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate them or take full advantage of them and therefore may not realize the benefits that we expect. If we are unsuccessful in our external growth program, we may not be able to grow our business significantly and we may incur asset impairment charges as a result of acquisitions that are not successful.     Our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation and oversight and changes in laws could adversely affect our revenues and profitability     Our business is in a highly regulated industry. As a result, governmental actions may adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition, including:              •   new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services;         •   changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity;         •   changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products;         •   new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing; and         •   changes in the tax laws relating to our operations.       The enactment in the U.S. of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, possible legislation which could ease the entry of competing follow-on biologics in the marketplace, and importation of lower-cost competing drugs from other jurisdictions are examples of changes and possible changes in laws that could adversely affect our business. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 included new authorization for the FDA to require post-market safety monitoring, along with a clinical trials registry, and expanded authority for FDA to impose civil monetary penalties on companies that fail to meet certain commitments.     If we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the healthcare industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and a loss of business     Our activities, including the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products, causing false claims to be submitted for government reimbursement as well as antitrust violations, or other violations related to environmental matters. Violations of governmental regulation may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in government programs. In addition to penalties for violation of laws and regulations, we could be required to repay amounts we received from government payors, or pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing information we have submitted to the government    37    Table of Contents   Whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation into alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, divert management time and attention and adversely affect our business.     The federal Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law prohibits payments intended to induce any entity either to purchase, order, or arrange for or recommend the purchase of healthcare products or services paid for under federal health care programs. There are similar laws in a number of states. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of drugs and biologics, such as us, by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, with hospitals, physicians, and other potential purchasers of drugs and biologics. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from federal health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, or other third party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance that can be substantial, including the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).     Problems with manufacturing or with inventory planning could result in our inability to deliver products, inventory shortages or surpluses, product recalls and increased costs     We manufacture and expect to continue to manufacture our own commercial requirements of bulk AVONEX and TYSABRI. Our products are difficult to manufacture and problems in our manufacturing processes can occur. Our inability to successfully manufacture bulk product and to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals of our manufacturing facilities would harm our ability to produce timely sufficient quantities of commercial supplies of AVONEX and TYSABRI to meet demand. Problems with manufacturing processes could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that could require us to delay shipment of products or recall or withdraw products previously shipped, which could result in inventory write-offs and impair our ability to expand into new markets or supply products in existing markets. In the past, we have had to write down and incur other charges and expenses for products that failed to meet specifications. Similar charges may occur in the future. In addition, lower than expected demand for our products, including suspension of sales, or a change in product mix may result in less than optimal utilization of our manufacturing facilities and lower inventory turnover, which could result in abnormal manufacturing variance charges, facility impairment charges and charges for excess and obsolete inventory.     We rely solely on our manufacturing facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, or RTP, for the production of TYSABRI. We plan on applying to the FDA and EMEA for approval of a production process, known as a second generation high-titer process, which has higher yields of TYSABRI than the process we currently use. If we do not obtain approval for that process, to meet anticipated demand for TYSABRI, we would need to increase our capital spending to add capacity at our RTP manufacturing facility and at the Hillerod, Denmark facility we are completing. Such an increase in capital spending would affect our business, cash position and results of operations.     If we cannot produce sufficient commercial requirements of bulk product to meet demand, we would need to rely on third party contract manufacturers, of which there are only a limited number capable of manufacturing bulk products of the type we require. We cannot be certain that we could reach agreement on reasonable terms, if at all, with those manufacturers. Even if we were to reach agreement, the transition of the manufacturing process to a third party to enable commercial supplies could take a significant amount of time. Our ability to supply products in sufficient capacity to meet demand is also dependent upon third party contractors to fill-finish, package and store such products. Any prolonged interruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities could result in cancellations of shipments or loss of product in the process of being manufactured. Because our manufacturing processes are highly complex and are subject to a lengthy FDA approval process, alternative qualified production capacity may not be available on a timely basis or at all.    38    Table of Contents   We rely on third parties to provide services in connection with the manufacture of our products and, in some instances, the manufacture of the product itself     We rely on Genentech for all RITUXAN manufacturing. Genentech relies on a third party to manufacture certain bulk RITUXAN requirements. If Genentech or any third party upon which it relies does not manufacture or fill-finish RITUXAN in sufficient quantities and on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if Genentech or any third party does not obtain and maintain all required manufacturing approvals, our business could be harmed.     We also source all of our fill-finish and the majority of our final product storage operations, along with a substantial portion of our packaging operations of the components used with our products, to a concentrated group of third party contractors. The manufacture of products and product components, fill-finish, packaging and storage of our products require successful coordination among us and multiple third party providers. Our inability to coordinate these efforts, the lack of capacity available at a third party contractor or any other problems with the operations of these third party contractors could require us to delay shipment of saleable products, recall products previously shipped or impair our ability to supply products at all. This could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share, diminish our profitability and damage our reputation. Any third party we use to fill-finish, package or store our products to be sold in the U.S. must be licensed by the FDA. As a result, alternative third party providers may not be readily available on a timely basis.     Due to the unique nature of the production of our products, there are several single source providers of raw materials. We make every effort to qualify new vendors and to develop contingency plans so that production is not impacted by short-term issues associated with single source providers. Nonetheless, our business could be materially impacted by long term or chronic issues associated with single source providers.     If we fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of our products, we could incur substantial remedial costs and a reduction in sales     We and our third party providers are generally required to maintain compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, and are subject to inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. Any changes of suppliers or modifications of methods of manufacturing require amending our application to the FDA and acceptance of the change by the FDA prior to release of product to the marketplace. Our inability, or the inability of our third party service providers, to demonstrate ongoing cGMP compliance could require us to withdraw or recall product and interrupt commercial supply of our products. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products. This non-compliance could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share and damage our reputation.     We have made a significant investment in constructing a manufacturing facility the success of which depends upon the completion and licensing of the facility and continued demand for our products     We are building a large-scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod, Denmark, in which we have invested approximately $379 million. We anticipate that the facility will be ready for commercial production in 2009. If we fail to manage the project, or other unforeseen events occur, we may incur additional costs to complete the project. Depending on the timing of the completion and licensing of the facility, and our other estimates and assumptions regarding future product sales, the carrying value of all or part of the manufacturing facility or other assets may not be fully recoverable and could result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value at the time that such effects are identified. The recognition of impairment in the carrying value, if any, could have a material and adverse affect on our results of operations. For example, if the anticipated demand for TYSABRI does not materialize, the carrying values of our Hillerod, Denmark facility could be impaired, which would negatively impact our results of operations.    39    Table of Contents   If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and key relationships, the growth of our business could be harmed     Our success will depend, to a great extent, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, manufacturing, sales and marketing and executive personnel and our ability to develop and maintain relationships with qualified clinical researchers and key distributors. Competition for these people and relationships is intense and we compete with numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as with universities and non-profit research organizations. Any inability we experience to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel or develop and maintain key relationships could have an adverse effect on our ability to accomplish our research, development and external growth objectives.     Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally     We are increasing our presence in international markets, which subjects us to many risks, such as:              •   economic problems that disrupt foreign healthcare payment systems;         •   fluctuations in currency exchange rates;         •   the imposition of governmental controls;         •   less favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws;         •   the inability to obtain any necessary foreign regulatory or pricing approvals of products in a timely manner;         •   restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities and trade restrictions;         •   changes in tax laws and tariffs;         •   difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and         •   longer payment cycles.       Our operations and marketing practices are also subject to regulation and scrutiny by the governments of the other countries in which we operate. In addition, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with meet the definition of a foreign official for purposes of the FCPA. Additionally, we are subject to other U.S. laws in our international operations. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, and/or the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions.     A portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. We recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period in which we incur those gains or losses. As a result, currency fluctuations among the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways.     Our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations     Our quarterly revenues, expenses and net income (loss) have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to the timing of charges and expenses that we may take. In recent periods, for instance, we have recorded charges that include:              •   acquired in-process research and development at the time we make an acquisition;         •   impairments that we are required to take with respect to investments;         •   impairments that we are required to take with respect to fixed assets, including those that are recorded in connection with the sale of fixed assets;      40    Table of Contents              •   Inventory write-downs for failed quality specifications, charges for excess and/or obsolete inventory and charges for inventory write downs relating to product suspensions; and         •   the cost of restructurings.       Additionally, net income may fluctuate due to the impact of charges we may be required to take with respect to foreign currency hedge transactions. In particular, we may incur higher charges from hedge ineffectiveness than we expect or from the termination of a hedge relationship.     These examples are only illustrative and other risks, including those discussed in these “Risk Factors,” could also cause fluctuations in our reported earnings. In addition, our operating results during any one quarter do not necessarily suggest the anticipated results of future quarters.     If we are unable to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitors may take advantage of our development efforts or our acquired technology     We have filed numerous patent applications in the U.S. and various other countries seeking protection of inventions originating from our research and development, including a number of our processes and products. Patents have been issued on many of these applications. We have also obtained rights to various patents and patent applications under licenses with third parties, which provide for the payment of royalties by us. The ultimate degree of patent protection that will be afforded to biotechnology products and processes, including ours, in the U.S. and in other important markets remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. Our patents may not afford us substantial protection or commercial benefit. Similarly, our pending patent applications or patent applications licensed from third parties may not ultimately be granted as patents and we may not prevail if patents that have been issued to us are challenged in court. In addition, pending legislation to reform the patent system could also reduce our ability to enforce our patents. We do not know when, or if, changes to the U.S. patent system will become law. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and prevent others from exploiting our inventions, we will not derive the benefit from them that we currently expect.     If our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we may incur damages and be required to incur the expense of obtaining a license     A substantial number of patents have already been issued to other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies. Competitors may have filed applications for, or have been issued patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that may relate to products or processes competitive with or similar to our products and processes. Moreover, the patent laws of the U.S. and foreign countries are distinct and decisions as to patenting, validity of patents and infringement of patents may be resolved differently in different countries. In general, we obtain licenses to third party patents that we deem necessary or desirable for the manufacture, use and sale of our products. We are currently unable to assess the extent to which we may wish or be required to acquire rights under such patents and the availability and cost of acquiring such rights, or whether a license to such patents will be available on acceptable terms or at all. There may be patents in the U.S. or in foreign countries or patents issued in the future that are unavailable to license on acceptable terms. Our inability to obtain such licenses may hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products.     Uncertainty over intellectual property in the biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation, which is inherently costly and unpredictable     We are aware that others, including various universities and companies working in the biotechnology field, have filed patent applications and have been granted patents in the U.S. and in other countries claiming subject matter potentially useful to our business. Some of those patents and patent applications claim only specific products or methods of making such products, while others claim more general processes or techniques useful or now used in the biotechnology industry. There is considerable uncertainty within the biotechnology industry about the validity, scope and enforceability of many issued patents in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world, and, to date, there is no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents. We cannot currently determine the ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be    41    Table of Contents   granted to third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted to be infringed by the manufacture, use and sale of our products.     There has been, and we expect that there may continue to be, significant litigation in the industry regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Litigation and administrative proceedings concerning patents and other intellectual property rights may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. Competitors may sue us as a way of delaying the introduction of our products. Any litigation, including any interference proceedings to determine priority of inventions, oppositions to patents in foreign countries or litigation against our partners, may be costly and time consuming and could harm our business. We expect that litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights. Litigation may be necessary in other instances to determine the validity, scope and/or noninfringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. Ultimately, the outcome of such litigation could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, or, conversely, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products.     Pending and future product liability claims may adversely affect our business and our reputation     The administration of drugs in humans, whether in clinical studies or commercially, carries the inherent risk of product liability claims whether or not the drugs are actually the cause of an injury. Our products or product candidates may cause, or may appear to have caused, injury or dangerous drug interactions, and we may not learn about or understand those effects until the product or product candidate has been administered to patients for a prolonged period of time. For example, lawsuits have been filed by patients who have had serious adverse events while using TYSABRI, and we may face lawsuits with other product liability and related claims by patients treated with TYSABRI or other products.     We cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any pending or future litigation. We may not be successful in defending ourselves in the litigation and, as a result, our business could be materially harmed. These lawsuits may result in large judgments or settlements against us, any of which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and business. Additionally, lawsuits can be expensive to defend, whether or not they have merit, and the defense of these actions may divert the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in managing our business.     We have recently incurred substantial indebtedness that could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business     We have recently incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness and we may also incur additional debt in the future. This indebtedness could have significant consequences to our business, for example, it could:              •   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;         •   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts and mergers and acquisitions; and         •   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt.       Our business involves environmental risks, which include the cost of compliance and the risk of contamination or injury     Our business and the business of several of our strategic partners, including Genentech and Elan, involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biologics and radioactive compounds. Biologics manufacturing is extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination, material equipment failure, or vendor or operator error. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with state and federal standards, there will always be the risk of accidental contamination or injury. In addition, microbial or viral contamination may cause the closure of a manufacturing facility for an    42    Table of Contents   extended period of time. By law, radioactive materials may only be disposed of at state-approved facilities. We currently store radioactive materials from our California laboratory on-site because the approval of a disposal site in California for all California-based companies has been delayed indefinitely. If and when a disposal site is approved, we may incur substantial costs related to the disposal of these materials. If we were to become liable for an accident, or if we were to suffer an extended facility shutdown, we could incur significant costs, damages and penalties that could harm our business. Biologics manufacturing also requires permits from government agencies for water supply and wastewater discharge. If we do not obtain appropriate permits, or permits for sufficient quantities of water and wastewater, we could incur significant costs and limits on our manufacturing volumes that could harm our business.     Our investments in marketable securities are significant and are subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce their value     We maintain a significant portfolio of investments in marketable securities. Our earnings may be adversely affected by changes in the value of this portfolio. In particular, the value of our investments may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the corporate bonds included in the portfolio and by other factors which may result in other than temporary declines in value of the investments. Each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.     We may incur liabilities to tax authorities in excess of amounts that have been accrued     The preparation of our financial statements requires estimates of the amount of tax that will become payable in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Accordingly, we determine our estimated liability for federal, state and local taxes (in the U.S.) and in many overseas jurisdictions. Our previous tax filings may be challenged by any of these taxing authorities and, in the event that we are not able to defend our position, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and such amounts could be significant. The jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation may enact or change laws that would adversely impact the rate at which we are taxed in future periods. Such actions could result in an additional income tax provision.     Several aspects of our corporate governance and our collaboration agreements may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire us     Several factors might discourage a takeover attempt that could be viewed as beneficial to stockholders who wish to receive a premium for their shares from a potential bidder. For example:              •   we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which provides that we may not enter into a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in the manner prescribed in Section 203;         •   our stockholder rights plan is designed to cause substantial dilution to a person who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors;         •   our board of directors has the authority to issue, without a vote or action of stockholders, up to 8,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares, each of which could be superior to the rights of holders of common stock;         •   our collaboration agreement with Elan provides Elan with the option to buy the rights to TYSABRI in the event that we undergo a change of control, which may limit our attractiveness to potential acquirers;         •   our amended and restated collaboration agreement with Genentech provides that, in the event we undergo a change of control, within 90 days Genentech may present an offer to us to purchase our rights to RITUXAN. Recently, in an arbitration proceeding brought by Biogen Idec relating to the collaboration agreement, Genentech alleged for the first time that the November 2003 transaction in which Idec acquired Biogen and became Biogen Idec constituted such a change of control, an assertion with which we strongly disagree. It is our position that the Biogen Idec merger did not constitute a      43    Table of Contents              change of control under our agreement with Genentech and that, even if it did, Genentech’s rights under the change of control provision have long since expired. We intend to vigorously assert our position if Genentech persists in making this claim. If the arbitrators decide this issue in favor of Genentech, or if a change of control were to occur in the future and Genentech were to present an offer for the RITUXAN rights, we must either accept Genentech’s offer or purchase Genentech’s rights to RITUXAN on the same terms as its offer. If Genentech presents such an offer, then they will be deemed concurrently to have exercised a right, in exchange for a share in the operating profits or net sales in the U.S. of any other anti-CD 20 products developed under the agreement, to purchase our interest in each such product.                •   our directors are elected to staggered terms, which prevents the entire board from being replaced in any single year; and         •   advance notice is required for nomination of candidates for election as a director and for proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders.
