Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 1 and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2009.  On January 31, 2007, Cooper entered into a $650 million syndicated Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit (Revolver) and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% Senior Notes due 2015 of which $339 million are outstanding. KeyBank led the Revolver refinancing, and the Revolver matures on January 31, 2012.  In connection with the normal management of our financial liabilities, we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our Senior Notes through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies  Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies listed below address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are:    43    Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC.

New Accounting Pronouncements  On November 1, 2009, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 350-30-35-5A, Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets. ASC Subtopic 350-30-35-5A applies to defensive intangible assets, which are acquired intangible assets that an entity does not intend to actively use but does intend to prevent others from obtaining access to the asset. ASC 350-30-35-5A requires an entity to account for defensive intangible assets as a separate unit of accounting. Defensive intangible assets should not be included as part of the cost of an entity’s existing intangible assets because the defensive intangible assets are separately identifiable. Defensive intangible assets must be recognized at fair value in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations and ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure. ASC 350-30-35-5A is effective prospectively for intangible assets acquired in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, or our fiscal year 2010.  On November 1, 2009, the Company adopted the deferred portions of FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for its non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a non recurring basis, including long-lived assets, goodwill, other intangible assets and exit liabilities. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance applies whenever other accounting guidance requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, but does not expand the use of fair value to new accounting transactions. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-06, which amends ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures: Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. ASU 2010-06 amends ASC 820 to add new requirements for disclosures about (1) the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, (2) the valuation techniques and inputs used, (3) the activity in level 3 fair value measurements and (4) the transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2010-06 is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. In the period of initial adoption, entities will not be required to provide the amended disclosures for any previous periods presented for comparative purposes. However, those disclosures are required for periods ending after initial adoption.    44    Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations, Concluded  The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2010-06, which is partially effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2010, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-09, Subsequent Events (Topic 855): Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements. This amendment removes the requirement for an SEC filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements. Revised financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of U.S. GAAP. The amendment in the ASU was effective for the Company upon issuance (February 24, 2010). The adoption of ASU 2010-09 had no effect on our consolidated financial statements.  On November 1, 2009, the Company adopted the FASB issued Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that may be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (FSP APB 14-1). FSP APB 14-1, which was issued in May 2008, requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. As a result, the liability component would be recorded at a discount reflecting its below market coupon interest rate, and the liability component would be accreted to its par value over its expected life, with the rate of interest that reflects the market rate at issuance being reflected in the results of operations. This change in methodology affects the calculations of net income and earnings per share, but will not increase the cash interest payments. FSP APB 14-1 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Retrospective application to all periods presented is required and early adoption is prohibited. The convertible senior debentures that the Company issued in fiscal 2003 and subsequently repurchased in fiscal 2008 are within the scope of FSP APB 14-1. The Company has adjusted the reported amounts in its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 31, 2009 as follows:  Consolidated Balance Sheet at October 31, 2009                      As Reported   Adjustments     As Adjusted      (In thousands)   Additional paid-in capital   $ 1,053,662   $ 9,627     $ 1,063,289   Retained earnings   $ 500,078   $ (9,627 )    $ 490,451 Trademarks  Aquaform, Avaira, Biofinity, Biomedics and Proclear are registered trademarks of The Cooper Companies, Inc., its affiliates and/or subsidiaries.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk  See “Risk Management” under Capital Resources and Liquidity in Item 2 of this report.  Item 4. Controls and Procedures  The Company has established and currently maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that any material information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to its principal officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  In conjunction with the close of each fiscal quarter, the Company conducts a review and evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based upon their evaluation as of January 31, 2010, the end of the fiscal quarter covered in this report, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  As of January 31, 2010, there has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.    46    Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  Item 1. Legal Proceedings  The Company is from time to time involved in various litigation and legal matters arising in the normal course of its business operations. By describing any particular matter, the Company does not intend to imply that it or its legal advisors have concluded or believe that the outcome of any of those particular matters is or is not likely to have a material adverse impact upon the Company’s consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.  In re Cooper Companies, Inc. Securities Litigation  On February 15, 2006, Alvin L. Levine filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. SACV-06-169 CJC, against the Company, A. Thomas Bender, its Chairman of the Board and a director, Robert S. Weiss, its Chief Executive Officer and a director, and John D. Fruth, a former director. On May 19, 2006, the Court consolidated this action and two related actions under the heading In re Cooper Companies, Inc. Securities Litigation and selected a lead plaintiff and lead counsel pursuant to the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4.  The lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint on July 31, 2006. The consolidated complaint was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s securities between July 28, 2004, and December 12, 2005, including persons who received Company securities in exchange for their shares of Ocular Sciences, Inc. (Ocular) in the January 2005 merger pursuant to which the Company acquired Ocular. In addition to the Company, Messrs. Bender, Weiss, and Fruth, the consolidated complaint named as defendants several of the Company’s other current officers and directors and former officers. On July 13, 2007, the Court granted Cooper’s motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint and granted the lead plaintiff leave to amend to attempt to state a valid claim.  On August 9, 2007, the lead plaintiff filed an amended consolidated complaint. In addition to the Company, the amended consolidated complaint names as defendants Messrs. Bender, Weiss, Fruth, Steven M. Neil, the Company’s former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Gregory A. Fryling, CooperVision’s former President and Chief Operating Officer.  The amended consolidated complaint purports to allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by, among other things, contending that the defendants made misstatements concerning the Biomedics product line, sales force integration following the merger with Ocular, the impact of silicone hydrogel lenses and financial projections. The amended consolidated complaint also alleges that the Company improperly accounted for assets acquired in the Ocular merger by improperly allocating $100 million of acquired customer relationships and manufacturing technology to goodwill (which is not amortized against earnings) instead of to intangible assets other than goodwill (which are amortized against earnings), that the Company lacked appropriate internal controls and issued false and misleading Sarbanes-Oxley Act certifications.    47    Table of Contents On October 23, 2007, the Court granted in-part and denied in-part Cooper and the individual defendants’ motion to dismiss. The Court dismissed the claims relating to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act certifications, the Company’s financial projections and the Company’s accounting of assets acquired in the Ocular merger. The Court denied the motion as to the claims related to alleged false statements concerning the Biomedics product line, sales force integration and the impact of silicone hydrogel lenses. On November 28, 2007, the Court dismissed all claims against Mr. Fruth. On December 3, 2007, the Company and Messrs. Bender, Weiss, Neil and Fryling answered the amended consolidated complaint. On April 8, 2008, the Court granted a motion by Mr. Neil for judgment on the pleadings as to him. On October 20, 2009, the Court reaffirmed that Plaintiffs’ financial projection claims had been dismissed in its earlier rulings.  On January 6, 2009, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. The certified class consists of those persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Cooper common stock between July 28, 2004, and November 21, 2005. Discovery in this matter has closed. Cooper and the individual defendants filed summary judgment motions on December 21, 2009. On February 2, 2010, the Court vacated the pre-trial and trial dates while it considered the summary judgment motions. On March 4, 2010, the Court denied in substantial part the motions for summary judgment. Court ordered settlement efforts have not been successful. The Company expects to exhaust its insurance coverage in defense of this litigation and if the case proceeds to trial, general and administrative expenses will increase. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously.  In re Cooper Companies, Inc. Derivative Litigation  On March 17, 2006, Eben Brice filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. 8:06-CV-00300-CJC-RNB, against several current and former officers and directors of the Company. The Company is named as a “nominal defendant.” Since the filing of the first purported shareholder derivative lawsuit, three similar purported shareholder derivative suits were filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. All four actions have been consolidated under the heading In re Cooper Companies, Inc. Derivative Litigation and the Court selected a lead plaintiff and lead counsel.  On September 11, 2006, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. The consolidated amended complaint names as defendants Messrs. Bender, Weiss, Fruth and Fryling. It also names as defendants current directors Michael Kalkstein, Moses Marx, Steven Rosenberg, Stanley Zinberg, Allan Rubenstein, Donald Press and one former director. The Company is a nominal defendant. The complaint purports to allege causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, insider trading, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment, and largely repeats the allegations in the class action securities case, described above. The time for the Company to respond to the consolidated amended complaint has not yet passed.  In addition to the derivative action pending in federal court, three similar purported shareholder actions were filed in the Superior Court for the State of California for the County of Alameda. These actions have been consolidated under the heading In re Cooper Companies, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation, Case Nos. RG06260748. A consolidated amended complaint was filed on September 18, 2006. The consolidated amended complaint names as defendants the same individuals that are the defendants in the federal derivative action. In addition, the complaint names current officers Carol R. Kaufman, Paul L. Remmell, Jeffrey Allan McLean, and Nicholas J. Pichotta and former officers. The Company is a nominal defendant. On November 29, 2006, the Superior Court for the County of Alameda entered an order staying the consolidated action pending the resolution of the federal derivative action.    48    Table of Contents Both the state and federal derivative actions are derivative in nature and do not seek damages from the Company.  Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our business faces significant risks. These risks include the risk described below. The risk factor set forth below was disclosed under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2009, and has been modified to reflect changes since that filing. This risk should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2009. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks, and the trading prices of our common stock could decline.  We face risks in connection with securities litigation.  The Company and several of its directors and officers have been named in a consolidated putative securities class action lawsuit and its directors and certain of its officers have been named in two consolidated derivative lawsuits, the nature and status of which are described in Item 1. Legal Proceedings. The consolidated putative securities class action seeks unspecified damages from the Company, and we are unable to estimate the range of potential losses that would be incurred if the plaintiffs in this action were to prevail, or to determine the total effect that it may have on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We expect to exhaust our insurance coverage in defense of this litigation and if the case proceeds to trial, general and administrative expenses will increase. A settlement or adverse judgment on the merits of this action could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, securities litigation, irrespective of its merits, is costly to defend and diverts management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.  The purported derivative lawsuits, which are at a very preliminary stage, do not seek damages from the Company. However, derivative litigation is costly, and these lawsuits may divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.    49    Table of Contents Item 6. Exhibits
