Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II, Item 8. Note 1 and Note 7 to consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008.  Outlook - Global Market and Economic Conditions  In the United States and globally, recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth into the first half of 2009. For our fiscal first half ended April 30, 2009, continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, bank failures and a declining real estate market in the U.S. have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the U.S. and the global economy. These conditions, combined with declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have contributed to substantial declines in capital markets and consumer confidence.  As a result of these market conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers. Continued turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers. If these market conditions continue, they may limit our ability, and the ability of our customers, to timely replace maturing liabilities, and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs, resulting in potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. These conditions may also affect the markets for our products as consumers may curtail buying habits.  We believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of $4.5 million plus cash generated by operating activities and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities will fund future operations, capital expenditures, cash dividends and small acquisitions. Over the past two fiscal years, the Company has made a significant investment in manufacturing capacity to support our silicone hydrogel and daily disposable contract lens product lines. We now have sufficient manufacturing capacity in production and reserve to satisfy our current demand projections for these products. Therefore, we plan to reduce overall capital expenditures related to manufacturing. Management believes that our projected outlook on sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for the next 12 months. At April 30, 2009, we had $150.8 million available under our $650 million syndicated bank credit facility.    48    Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations, Continued    Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies  Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies listed below address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are:        •    Revenue recognition        •    Allowance for doubtful accounts        •    Net realizable value of inventory        •    Valuation of goodwill        •    Business combinations        •    Income taxes        •    Share-based compensation  During the fiscal first half of 2009, there were no significant changes in our estimates and critical accounting policies. Please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, for a more complete discussion of our estimates and critical accounting policies.  New Accounting Pronouncements  On February 1, 2009, the Company adopted the required portions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161), with no material impact to the consolidated condensed financial statements. SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), with the intent of providing users of the financial statements with an enhanced understanding of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedge items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedge items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures above fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk related contingent features in derivative agreements. See Note 6 for disclosures of the Company’s derivative instruments.    49    Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations, Continued    In April 2009, the Financial Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (FSP 157-4). FSP 157-4 provides guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities when the volume and level of activity for the asset/liability has significantly decreased. FSP 157-4 also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. In addition, FSP 157-4 requires disclosure in interim and annual periods of the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques. FSP 157-4 is effective for the Company beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2009. The Company does not expect a significant impact from the adoption of this statement on our consolidated financial statements.  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, Interim Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (FSP 107-1/APB 28-1). FSP 107-1/APB 28-1 requires interim disclosures regarding the fair values of financial instruments that are within the scope of FAS 107, Disclosures about the Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Additionally, FSP 107-1/APB 28-1 requires disclosure of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments on an interim basis as well as changes of the methods and significant assumptions from prior periods. FSP 107-1/APB 28-1 is effective for the Company beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the application of this FSP will have on its consolidated financial statements  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 141(R)-1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies (FSP 141(R)-1). FSP 141(R)-1 requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably estimated. If fair value of such an asset or liability cannot be reasonably estimated, the asset or liability would generally be recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 14, Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss. FSP 141(R)-1 eliminates the requirement to disclose an estimate of the range of outcomes of recognized contingencies at the acquisition date but requires that contingent consideration arrangements of an acquiree assumed by the acquirer in a business combination be treated as contingent consideration of the acquirer and should be initially and subsequently measured at fair value in accordance with Statement 141R. This FSP will be adopted by the Company in its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2009.    50    Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk  See “Risk Management” under Capital Resources and Liquidity in Item 2 of this report.      Item 4. Controls and Procedures  The Company has established and currently maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that any material information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to its principal officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  In conjunction with the close of each fiscal quarter, the Company conducts a review and evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based upon their evaluation as of April 30, 2009, the end of the fiscal quarter covered in this report, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  As of April 30, 2009, there has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.    52    Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1. Legal Proceedings  The Company is from time to time involved in various litigation and legal matters arising in the normal course of its business operations. By describing any particular matter, the Company does not intend to imply that it or its legal advisors have concluded or believe that the outcome of any of those particular matters is or is not likely to have a material adverse impact upon the Company’s consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.  In re The Cooper Cos., Inc., Securities Litigation  On February 15, 2006, Alvin L. Levine filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. SACV-06-169 CJC, against the Company, A. Thomas Bender, its Chairman of the Board and a director, Robert S. Weiss, its Chief Executive Officer and a director, and John D. Fruth, a former director. On May 19, 2006, the Court consolidated this action and two related actions under the heading In re Cooper Companies, Inc. Securities Litigation and selected a lead plaintiff and lead counsel pursuant to the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4.  The lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint on July 31, 2006. The consolidated complaint was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s securities between July 28, 2004, and December 12, 2005, including persons who received Company securities in exchange for their shares of Ocular Sciences, Inc. (Ocular) in the January 2005 merger pursuant to which the Company acquired Ocular. In addition to the Company, Messrs. Bender, Weiss, and Fruth, the consolidated complaint named as defendants several of the Company’s other current officers and directors and former officers. On July 13, 2007, the Court granted Cooper’s motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint and granted the lead plaintiff leave to amend to attempt to state a valid claim.  On August 9, 2007, the lead plaintiff filed an amended consolidated complaint. In addition to the Company, the amended consolidated complaint names as defendants Messrs. Bender, Weiss, Fruth, Steven M. Neil, the Company’s former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Gregory A. Fryling, CooperVision’s former President and Chief Operating Officer.  The amended consolidated complaint purports to allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by, among other things, contending that the defendants made misstatements concerning the Biomedics® product line, sales force integration following the merger with Ocular, the impact of silicone hydrogel lenses and financial projections. The amended consolidated complaint also alleges that the Company improperly accounted for assets acquired in the Ocular merger by improperly allocating $100 million of acquired customer relationships and manufacturing technology to goodwill (which is not amortized against earnings) instead of to intangible assets other than goodwill (which are amortized against earnings), that the Company lacked appropriate internal controls and issued false and misleading Sarbanes-Oxley Act certifications.    53    Table of Contents On October 23, 2007, the Court granted in-part and denied in-part Cooper and the individual defendants’ motion to dismiss. The Court dismissed the claims relating to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act certifications and the Company’s accounting of assets acquired in the Ocular merger. The Court denied the motion as to the claims related to alleged false statements concerning the Biomedics product line, sales force integration, the impact of silicone hydrogel lenses and the Company’s financial projections. On November 28, 2007, the Court dismissed all claims against Mr. Fruth. On December 3, 2007, the Company and Messrs. Bender, Weiss, Neil and Fryling answered the amended consolidated complaint. On April 8, 2008, the Court granted a motion by Mr. Neil for judgment on the pleadings as to him. A February 17, 2010, trial date has been set and discovery has commenced. On January 6, 2009, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. The certified class consists of those persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Cooper common stock between July 28, 2004 and November 21, 2005. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously.  In re Cooper Companies, Inc. Derivative Litigation  On March 17, 2006, Eben Brice filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. 8:06-CV-00300-CJC-RNB, against several current and former officers and directors of the Company. The Company is named as a “nominal defendant.” Since the filing of the first purported shareholder derivative lawsuit, three similar purported shareholder derivative suits were filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. All four actions have been consolidated under the heading In re Cooper Companies, Inc. Derivative Litigation and the Court selected a lead plaintiff and lead counsel.  On September 11, 2006, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. The consolidated amended complaint names as defendants Messrs. Bender, Weiss, Fruth and Fryling. It also names as defendants current directors Michael Kalkstein, Moses Marx, Steven Rosenberg, Stanley Zinberg, Allan Rubenstein, and one former director. The Company is a nominal defendant. The complaint purports to allege causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, insider trading, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment, and largely repeats the allegations in the class action securities case, described above. Under the existing scheduling order, the Company has until September 12, 2009, to respond to the consolidated amended complaint.  In addition to the derivative action pending in federal court, three similar purported shareholder actions were filed in the Superior Court for the State of California for the County of Alameda. These actions have been consolidated under the heading In re Cooper Companies, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation, Case Nos. RG06260748. A consolidated amended complaint was filed on September 18, 2006. The consolidated amended complaint names as defendants the same individuals that are the defendants in the federal derivative action. In addition, the complaint names Mr. Fryling, current officers Carol R. Kaufman, John J. Calcagno, Paul L. Remmell, Jeffrey Allan McLean, and Nicholas J. Pichotta and a former officer. The Company is a nominal defendant. On November 29, 2006, the Superior Court for the County of Alameda entered an order staying the consolidated action pending the resolution of the federal derivative action.    54    Table of Contents Both the state and federal derivative actions are derivative in nature and do not seek damages from the Company.  Bausch & Lomb Incorporated Litigation  On October 5, 2004, Bausch & Lomb Incorporated (Bausch & Lomb) filed a lawsuit against Ocular Sciences, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York alleging that its Biomedics toric soft contact lens and its private label equivalents infringe Bausch & Lomb’s U.S. Patent No. 6,113,236 relating to toric contact lenses having optimized thickness profiles. The complaint seeks an award of damages, including multiple damages, attorneys’ fees and costs and an injunction preventing the alleged infringement. Following an order on claim construction, the parties reached a settlement resolving all claims on February 25, 2009. Pursuant to this settlement, Bausch & Lomb dismissed its complaint with prejudice and provided CVI a perpetual and fully paid up royalty-free license to the ‘236 patent.      Item 1A.
