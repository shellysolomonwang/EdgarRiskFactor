Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 1 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016.On March 1, 2016, we entered into a syndicated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement (2016 Credit Agreement) with Keybank as administrative agent. The agreement provides for a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion and a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $830.0 million. The 2016 Credit Agreement replaced our previous credit agreement and funds from the new term loan were used to repay the outstanding amounts under the previous Credit Agreement, to partially repay our other outstanding term loans and for general corporate purposes. At April 30, 2017, we had $754.8 million available under the revolving credit facility and $830.0 million outstanding under the term loan. On August 4, 2014, we entered into a three-year, $700.0 million, senior unsecured term loan agreement with a maturity date of August 4, 2017. There was no amortization of the principal, and we could prepay the loan balances from time to time, in whole or in part, with premium or penalty. We repaid $493.0 million of the outstanding balance in fiscal 2016 and repaid the remaining $207.0 million of the outstanding balance in the fiscal second quarter of 2017. At April 30, 2017, there was no outstanding balance on this term loan.On September 12, 2013, we entered into a five-year, $300.0 million, senior unsecured term loan agreement with a maturity date of September 12, 2018, subject to amortization of principal of 5% per year payable quarterly beginning October 31, 2016, with the balance payable at maturity. We repaid $15.0 million of the outstanding balance in fiscal 2016. At April 30, 2017, there was $285.0 million outstanding on this term loan. Subsequent to the end of fiscal second quarter, we fully repaid the remaining $285.0 million in May 2017 using the funds from the 2016 Credit Agreement.See Note 6.

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives.

The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based upon their evaluation as of April 30, 2017, the end of the fiscal quarter covered in this report, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.As of April 30, 2017, there has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.38Table of ContentsTHE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESPART II—OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1. Legal ProceedingsSince March 2015, over 50 putative class action complaints were filed by contact lens consumers alleging that contact lens manufacturers, in conjunction with their respective Unilateral Pricing Policy (UPP), conspired to reach agreements between each other and certain distributors and retailers regarding the prices at which certain contact lenses could be sold to consumers. The plaintiffs are seeking damages against CooperVision, Inc., other contact lens manufacturers, distributors and retailers, in various courts around the United States. In June 2015, all of the class action cases were consolidated and transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. CooperVision and the other defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss the complaints in December 2015. In June 2016, the motion to dismiss with respect to claims brought under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act was granted, but the motion to dismiss with respect to claims brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and other state laws was denied. The actions currently are in discovery. In March 2017, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. CooperVision denies the allegations and intends to defend the actions vigorously. At this time, we do not believe a loss or adverse effect on our financial condition is probable nor is any range of potential loss reasonably estimable.Item 1A.
