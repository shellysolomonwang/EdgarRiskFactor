Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 1 and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2011.  In fiscal 2011, we refinanced our syndicated Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit due to mature on January 31, 2012, with a new Credit Agreement that provides for a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million and an amortizing term loan facility in an original principal amount of $250.0 million, each of which, mature on January 12, 2016. On February 15, 2011, we redeemed all $339.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our Senior Notes, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, from borrowings under the new Credit Agreement, including $250.0 million from the term loan facility.  Item 4. Controls and Procedures  The Company has established and currently maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that any material information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to its principal officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  In conjunction with the close of each fiscal quarter, the Company conducts a review and evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based upon their evaluation as of January 31, 2012, the end of the fiscal quarter covered in this report, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  As of January 31, 2012, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.    34    Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  Item 1. Legal Proceedings  Tax Matter  On April 1, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a Notice of Deficiency to the Company in connection with its audit of the Company’s income tax returns for the years 2005 and 2006. The Notice asserted that the Company is subject to additional taxes due for its tax year 2005 under the anti-deferral provisions of Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code. A settlement concerning the 2005 claimed deficiency was subsequently reached with District Counsel for the IRS which effectively settled all related matters. The decision document was filed with the U.S. Tax Court on January 19, 2012 with an agreed net deficiency of about $50 thousand.  Securities Litigation  On November 28, 2011, Harold Greenberg filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Case No. 4:11-cv-05697-YGR, against the following defendants: the Company; Robert S. Weiss, its President, Chief Executive Officer and a director; Eugene J. Midlock, its former Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Albert G. White, III, its Vice President of Investor Relations, Treasurer and Chief Strategic Officer. On December 12, 2011, a second individual, Ross Wallen, filed a related complaint against the same defendants in the Northern District of California, Case No. 4:11-cv-06214-YGR. The Wallen complaint largely repeats the allegations in the Greenberg complaint. Greenberg and Wallen each sought to represent a class of persons who purchased the Company’s common stock between March 4, 2011 and November 15, 2011.  The Greenberg and Wallen complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by, among other things, failing to disclose alleged problems at the Company’s manufacturing plants in Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom, allegedly making material misstatements with an intent to deceive investors concerning the recall of the Company’s Avaira Toric and Avaira Sphere contact lenses and the expected financial impact of the recalls, and allegedly making false projections of future financial results. Both complaints seek unspecified damages on behalf of the purported class.  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 sets out a procedure for the court to consolidate related securities class actions and to appoint a lead plaintiff. On February 29, 2012, the court ordered the Greenberg and Wallen actions be consolidated and appointed Universal-Investment-Gesellschaft mbH as lead plaintiff.  The lawsuits have only recently been filed and there has been no discovery or other proceedings. Accordingly, the Company is not in a position to assess whether any loss or adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition is probable or remote or to estimate the range of potential loss, if any.    35    Table of Contents Derivative Litigation  On January 9, 2012, Joseph Operman filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Case No. 4:12-cv-00143-YGR, against members of the Company's board of directors. The derivative complaint seeks recovery on behalf of the Company, which is named as a “nominal defendant.” The derivative complaint purports to allege causes of action for breach of fiduciary duties and failure to exercise oversight responsibilities against all defendants and a cause of action for contribution against Mr. Weiss for alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The derivative complaint largely repeats the allegations in the securities class action complaints described above. The Company and the individual defendants have not yet filed a response to the derivative complaint.  Item 1A. Risk Factors  There have been no material changes in the Company’s risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended October 31, 2011.  Item 2.

Purchases under the 2012 Share Repurchase Program may be made from time-to-time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions and are subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time and will be made from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. This program runs through December 31, 2012 and may be discontinued at any time. At January 31, 2012, approximately $103.9 million remained authorized for repurchase under the 2012 Share Repurchase Program.    36    Table of Contents Item 6. Exhibits
