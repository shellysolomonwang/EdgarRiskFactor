Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 1 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.  On January 31, 2007, Cooper entered into a $650 million syndicated Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit (Revolver) and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% of senior notes, of which $339 million are outstanding. KeyBank led the Revolver refinancing and the Revolver matures on January 31, 2012.  In connection with the normal management of our financial liabilities, we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our Senior Notes through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations, Continued    Outlook - Global Market and Economic Conditions  In the United States and globally, recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth into the first quarter of 2009. For our fiscal first quarter ended January 31, 2009, continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, bank failures and a declining real estate market in the U.S. have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the U.S. and the global economy. These conditions, combined with declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have contributed to substantial declines in capital markets and consumer confidence.  As a result of these market conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers. Continued turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers. If these market conditions continue, they may limit our ability, and the ability of our customers, to timely replace maturing liabilities, and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs, resulting in potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. These conditions may also affect the markets for our products as consumers may curtail buying habits similar to our slower than expected contact lens sales in October and November 2008.  We believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of $1.9 million plus cash generated by operating activities and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities will fund future operations, capital expenditures, cash dividends and small acquisitions. Management believes that our projected outlook on sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for the next 12 months. At January 31, 2009, we had $117.8 million available under our $650 million syndicated bank credit facility.    44    Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations, Continued    Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies  Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies listed below address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are:        •    Revenue recognition        •    Allowance for doubtful accounts        •    Net realizable value of inventory        •    Valuation of goodwill        •    Business combinations        •    Income taxes        •    Share-based compensation  During the fiscal first quarter of 2009, there were no significant changes in our estimates and critical accounting policies. Please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, for a more complete discussion of our estimates and critical accounting policies.  New Accounting Pronouncements  On November 1, 2008, the Company adopted the required portions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, and FSP FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active (FSP 157-3), with no material impact to the consolidated condensed financial statements. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 currently applies to all financial assets and liabilities, and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. In February 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157-2, delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. The delayed portions of SFAS No. 157 will be adopted by the Company beginning in its fiscal year ending October 31, 2010. The adoption of the nondelayed portions of SFAS No. 157 is more fully described in Note 5. FSP 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active.    45    Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations, Continued    On November 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not applied the fair value option to any items; therefore, SFAS No. 159 did not have an impact on the consolidated condensed financial statements.  On November 1, 2008, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, and there was no material impact to the consolidated condensed financial statements. Effective October 31, 2007, we adopted the balance sheet recognition provision of this standard and accordingly recognized the funded status of the Company’s defined benefit postretirement plan. Effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, the standard also required the measurement date for the Company’s defined benefit postretirement plan assets and benefit obligations to coincide with the fiscal year-end.  In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1, Employer’s Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. This FSP amends SFAS No. 132 (Revised 2003), Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, to expand the disclosure requirements for an employer’s plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This FSP is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009, with early application permitted. This FSP will be adopted by the Company in its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2010, on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the application of this FSP will have on its consolidated financial statements.

AND SUBSIDIARIES      Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk  See “Risk Management” under Capital Resources and Liquidity in Item 2 of this report.      Item 4. Controls and Procedures  The Company has established and currently maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that any material information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to its principal officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  In conjunction with the close of each fiscal quarter, the Company conducts a review and evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based upon their evaluation as of January 31, 2009, the end of the fiscal quarter covered in this report, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  As of January 31, 2009, there has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.    47    Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1. Legal Proceedings  The Company is from time to time involved in various litigation and legal matters arising in the normal course of its business operations. By describing any particular matter, the Company does not intend to imply that it or its legal advisors have concluded or believe that the outcome of any of those particular matters is or is not likely to have a material adverse impact upon the Company’s consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.  In re The Cooper Cos., Inc., Securities Litigation  On February 15, 2006, Alvin L. Levine filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. SACV-06-169 CJC, against the Company, A. Thomas Bender, its Chairman of the Board and a director, Robert S. Weiss, its Chief Executive Officer and a director, and John D. Fruth, a former director. On May 19, 2006, the Court consolidated this action and two related actions under the heading In re Cooper Companies, Inc. Securities Litigation and selected a lead plaintiff and lead counsel pursuant to the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4.  The lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint on July 31, 2006. The consolidated complaint was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s securities between July 28, 2004, and December 12, 2005, including persons who received Company securities in exchange for their shares of Ocular Sciences, Inc. (Ocular) in the January 2005 merger pursuant to which the Company acquired Ocular. In addition to the Company, Messrs. Bender, Weiss, and Fruth, the consolidated complaint named as defendants several of the Company’s other current officers and directors and former officers. On July 13, 2007, the Court granted Cooper’s motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint and granted the lead plaintiff leave to amend to attempt to state a valid claim.  On August 9, 2007, the lead plaintiff filed an amended consolidated complaint. In addition to the Company, the amended consolidated complaint names as defendants Messrs. Bender, Weiss, Fruth, Steven M. Neil, the Company’s former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Gregory A. Fryling, CooperVision’s former President and Chief Operating Officer.  The amended consolidated complaint purports to allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by, among other things, contending that the defendants made misstatements concerning the Biomedics® product line, sales force integration following the merger with Ocular, the impact of silicone hydrogel lenses and financial projections. The amended consolidated complaint also alleges that the Company improperly accounted for assets acquired in the Ocular merger by improperly allocating $100 million of acquired customer relationships and manufacturing technology to goodwill (which is not amortized against earnings) instead of to intangible assets other than goodwill (which are amortized against earnings), that the Company lacked appropriate internal controls and issued false and misleading Sarbanes-Oxley Act certifications.    48    Table of Contents On October 23, 2007, the Court granted in-part and denied in-part Cooper and the individual defendants’ motion to dismiss. The Court dismissed the claims relating to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act certifications and the Company’s accounting of assets acquired in the Ocular merger. The Court denied the motion as to the claims related to alleged false statements concerning the Biomedics product line, sales force integration, the impact of silicone hydrogel lenses and the Company’s financial projections. On November 28, 2007, the Court dismissed all claims against Mr. Fruth. On December 3, 2007, the Company and Messrs. Bender, Weiss, Neil and Fryling answered the amended consolidated complaint. On April 8, 2008, the Court granted a motion by Mr. Neil for judgment on the pleadings as to him. A February 17, 2010, trial date has been set, and discovery has commenced. On January 6, 2009, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. The certified class consists of those persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Cooper common stock between July 28, 2004 and November 21, 2005. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously.  In re Cooper Companies, Inc. Derivative Litigation  On March 17, 2006, Eben Brice filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. 8:06-CV-00300-CJC-RNB, against several current and former officers and directors of the Company. The Company is named as a “nominal defendant.” Since the filing of the first purported shareholder derivative lawsuit, three similar purported shareholder derivative suits were filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. All four actions have been consolidated under the heading In re Cooper Companies, Inc. Derivative Litigation and the Court selected a lead plaintiff and lead counsel.  On September 11, 2006, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. The consolidated amended complaint names as defendants Messrs. Bender, Weiss, Fruth and Fryling. It also names as defendants current directors Michael Kalkstein, Moses Marx, Steven Rosenberg, Stanley Zinberg, Allan Rubenstein, and one former director. The Company is a nominal defendant. The complaint purports to allege causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, insider trading, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment, and largely repeats the allegations in the class action securities case, described above. Under the existing scheduling order, the Company has until September 12, 2009, to respond to the consolidated amended complaint.  In addition to the derivative action pending in federal court, three similar purported shareholder actions were filed in the Superior Court for the State of California for the County of Alameda. These actions have been consolidated under the heading In re Cooper Companies, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation, Case Nos. RG06260748. A consolidated amended complaint was filed on September 18, 2006. The consolidated amended complaint names as defendants the same individuals that are the defendants in the federal derivative action. In addition, the complaint names Mr. Fryling, current officers Carol R. Kaufman, John J. Calcagno, Paul L. Remmell, Jeffrey Allan McLean, and Nicholas J. Pichotta and a former officer. The Company is a nominal defendant. On November 29, 2006, the Superior Court for the County of Alameda entered an order staying the consolidated action pending the resolution of the federal derivative action.    49    Table of Contents Both the state and federal derivative actions are derivative in nature and do not seek damages from the Company.  Bausch & Lomb Incorporated Litigation  On October 5, 2004, Bausch & Lomb Incorporated (Bausch & Lomb) filed a lawsuit against Ocular Sciences, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York alleging that its Biomedics toric soft contact lens and its private label equivalents infringe Bausch & Lomb’s U.S. Patent No. 6,113,236 relating to toric contact lenses having optimized thickness profiles. The complaint seeks an award of damages, including multiple damages, attorneys’ fees and costs and an injunction preventing the alleged infringement. Following an order on claim construction, the parties reached a settlement resolving all claims on February 25, 2009. Pursuant to this settlement, Bausch & Lomb dismissed its complaint with prejudice and provided CVI a perpetual and fully paid up royalty-free license to the ‘236 patent.      Item 1A.
