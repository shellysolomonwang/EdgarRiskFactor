The new agreement provides for a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion and a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $830.0 million. The 2016 Credit Agreement replaced our previous credit agreement and funds from the new term loan were used to repay the $200.0 million outstanding principal amount of the two uncommitted revolving lines of credit, entered into on March 24, 2015 and the outstanding amounts under the previous credit agreement. We also used funds from the new term loan to partially repay outstanding amounts under the term loans entered into on August 4, 2014 and September 12, 2013 and for general corporate purposes. At July 31, 2016, we had $999.8 million available under the revolving credit facility and $830.0 million outstanding under the term loan. For more information, please see the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements. On August 4, 2014, we entered into a three-year, $700.0 million, senior unsecured term loan agreement that will mature on August 4, 2017. There is no amortization of the principal, and we may prepay the loan balances from time to time, in whole or in part, with premium or penalty. We repaid $400.0 million of the outstanding balance during the fiscal second quarter of 2016. At July 31, 2016, $300.0 million remained outstanding on this term loan.On September 12, 2013, we entered into a five-year, $300.0 million, senior unsecured term loan agreement that will mature on September 12, 2018, and will be subject to amortization of principal of 5% per year payable quarterly beginning October 31, 2016, with the balance payable at maturity. We repaid $15.0 million of the outstanding balance during the fiscal second quarter of 2016. At July 31, 2016, $285.0 million remained outstanding on this term loan.40Table of ContentsTHE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESItem 4. Controls and ProceduresThe Company has established and currently maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that any material information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to its principal officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.In conjunction with the close of each fiscal quarter, the Company conducts a review and evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based upon their evaluation as of July 31, 2016, the end of the fiscal quarter covered in this report, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.As of July 31, 2016, there has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.41Table of ContentsTHE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESPART II—OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1. Legal ProceedingsSince March 2015, over 50 putative class action complaints were filed by contact lens consumers alleging that contact lens manufacturers, in conjunction with their respective Unilateral Pricing Policy (UPP), conspired to reach agreements between each other and certain distributors and retailers regarding the prices at which certain contact lenses could be sold to consumers. The plaintiffs are seeking damages against CooperVision, Inc., other contact lens manufacturers, distributors and retailers, in various courts around the United States. In June 2015, all of the class action cases were consolidated and transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. CooperVision and the other defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss the complaints in December 2015. In June 2016, the motion to dismiss with respect to claims brought under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act was granted, but the motion to dismiss with respect to claims brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and other state laws was denied. The actions currently are in discovery. CooperVision denies the allegations and intends to defend the actions vigorously. At this time, we do not believe a loss or adverse effect on our financial condition is probable nor is any range of potential loss reasonably estimable.Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisk factors describing the major risks to our business can be found under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. Except for the risk factor set forth below, there has been no material change in our risk factors from those previously discussed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year October 31, 2015. The results of the United Kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.We are a multinational company headquartered in the United States with worldwide operations, including significant business operations in Europe, including in the United Kingdom. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process. Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. This development has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union would have and how such withdrawal could affect, and may have a material adverse effect on, our business, financial condition and operating results.42Table of ContentsTHE COOPER COMPANIES, INC.
