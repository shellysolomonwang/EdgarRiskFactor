The agreement provides for a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion and a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $830.0 million. The 2016 Credit Agreement replaced our previous credit agreement and funds from the new term loan were used to repay the outstanding amounts under the previous Credit Agreement, to partially repay our other outstanding term loans and for general corporate purposes. At July 31, 2017, we had $645.7 million available under the revolving credit facility and $830.0 million outstanding under the term loan. On August 4, 2014, we entered into a three-year, $700.0 million, senior unsecured term loan agreement with a maturity date of August 4, 2017. There was no amortization of the principal, and we could prepay the loan balances from time to time, in whole or in part, with premium or penalty. We repaid $493.0 million of the outstanding balance in fiscal 2016 and repaid the remaining $207.0 million of the outstanding balance in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. At July 31, 2017, there was no outstanding balance on this term loan.On September 12, 2013, we entered into a five-year, $300.0 million, senior unsecured term loan agreement with a maturity date of September 12, 2018, subject to amortization of principal of 5% per year payable quarterly beginning October 31, 2016, with the balance payable at maturity.

Controls and ProceduresThe Company has established and currently maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that any material information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to its principal officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.In conjunction with the close of each fiscal quarter, the Company conducts a review and evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based upon their evaluation at July 31, 2017, the end of the fiscal quarter covered in this report, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.As of July 31, 2017, there has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.39Table of ContentsTHE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESPART II—OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1. Legal ProceedingsSince March 2015, over 50 putative class action complaints were filed by contact lens consumers alleging that contact lens manufacturers, in conjunction with their respective Unilateral Pricing Policy (UPP), conspired to reach agreements between each other and certain distributors and retailers regarding the prices at which certain contact lenses could be sold to consumers. The plaintiffs are seeking damages against CooperVision, Inc., other contact lens manufacturers, distributors and retailers, in various courts around the United States. In June 2015, all of the class action cases were consolidated and transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. CooperVision and the other defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss the complaints in December 2015. In June 2016, the motion to dismiss with respect to claims brought under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act was granted, but the motion to dismiss with respect to claims brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and other state laws was denied. The actions currently are in discovery. In March 2017, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. In August 2017, CooperVision entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs, without any admission of liability, to settle all claims against CooperVision, subject to Court approval of the settlement. The Company has recorded a settlement accrual of $3.0 million for the third quarter fiscal ended July 31, 2017.Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisk factors describing the major risks to our business can be found under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. Except for the risk factor set forth below, there has been no material change in our risk factors from those previously discussed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year October 31, 2016.Increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results.Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the Company has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates, by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws. We are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by other tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.The United Kingdom HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs) (“UK Authorities”) enacted a new Diverted Profits Tax as of April 1, 2015 on profits of multinationals artificially diverted from the UK. The tax rate will be 25%. Diverted Profits Tax will apply in two situations; (a) where a foreign company has artificially avoided having a taxable presence in the UK, or (b) where a group has entered into a tax advantageous structure or transaction that lacks economic substance.Although the legislation intends to address aggressive tax planning which is artificial or lacks economic substance, the legislation has a wider reach. The UK Authorities have now began an inquiry regarding the application of UK Diverted Profits Tax (DPT). In assessing whether they believe the Company is subject to the DPT legislation, the UK Authorities expanded its review to include overall transfer pricing for fiscal 2015. We believe that these transactions have economic substance and should fall outside the intended reach of the Diverted Profit Tax. However, if we are unsuccessful in defending our positions, it may have an impact on our financial results.40Table of ContentsTHE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESItem 2.
