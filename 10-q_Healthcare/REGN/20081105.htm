</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interim Condensed Financial Statements of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Regeneron&#148; or
the &#147;Company&#148;) have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article&nbsp;10
of Regulation&nbsp;S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all information and disclosures necessary for
a presentation of the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the
opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of
normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company&#146;s financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows for such periods. The results of operations for any interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The December&nbsp;31, 2007
Condensed Balance Sheet data were derived from audited financial statements, but do not include all
disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes
thereto contained in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in research and development expenses is the Company&#146;s share of VEGF Trap-Eye
development expenses incurred by Bayer HealthCare LLC, including the Company&#146;s share of Bayer
HealthCare&#146;s estimated VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses for the most recent interim fiscal
quarter. Bayer HealthCare&#146;s estimate is reconciled to its actual expenses for such quarter in the
subsequent interim fiscal quarter and the Company&#146;s share of VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses
incurred by Bayer HealthCare is adjusted accordingly. During the three and nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2008, the Company recognized cost sharing of Bayer HealthCare VEGF Trap-Eye
development expenses of $3.6&nbsp;million and $19.0&nbsp;million, respectively. For the three months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2008, cost sharing of Bayer HealthCare development expenses consists of $4.1&nbsp;million
of estimated third quarter expense less a $0.5&nbsp;million adjustment to reconcile Bayer HealthCare&#146;s
actual second quarter 2008 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses to its prior estimate.

States for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS). During the three and
nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, the Company shipped $4.3&nbsp;million and $6.7&nbsp;million,
respectively, of ARCALYST to its distributors. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales
in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;104, <I>Revenue Recognition </I>(&#147;SAB 104&#148;). Revenue
from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to
product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or
determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured and the Company has no further
performance obligations. Revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for
prompt pay discounts, product returns, estimated rebates payable under governmental programs
(including Medicaid), distribution fees, and other sales-related costs.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company began capitalizing inventory costs associated with commercial supplies of ARCALYST
subsequent to receipt of marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) in
February&nbsp;2008. Costs for manufacturing supplies of ARCALYST prior to receipt of FDA approval were
recognized as research and development expenses in the period that the costs were incurred.
Therefore, these costs are not being included in cost of goods sold when revenue is recognized from
the sale of those supplies of ARCALYST. For the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008,
ARCALYST cost of goods sold totaled $0.3&nbsp;million. At September&nbsp;30, 2008, inventoried costs related
to ARCALYST were insignificant.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s basic and diluted net loss per share amounts have been computed by dividing net
loss by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and Class&nbsp;A Stock outstanding. Net
loss per share is presented on a combined basis, inclusive of Common Stock and Class&nbsp;A Stock
outstanding, as each class of stock has equivalent economic rights. For the three and nine months
ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, the Company reported net losses; therefore, no common stock
equivalents were included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for these periods, since
such inclusion would have been antidilutive. The calculations of basic and diluted net loss per
share are as follows:

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company considers its marketable securities, which consist primarily of U.S. government, corporate, and asset-backed securities, to be &#147;available-for-sale,&#148; as defined by
SFAS 115, <I>Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities</I>. These assets are
carried at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are included in other accumulated
comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity. If the decline in the
value of a marketable security in the Company&#146;s investment portfolio is deemed to be
other-than-temporary, the Company writes down the security to its current fair value and recognizes
a loss that is charged against income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews its portfolio of marketable securities, using both
quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine if declines in fair value below cost are
other-than-temporary. Such factors include the length of time and the extent to which market value
has been less than cost, financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, recommendations
of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market, or industry trends. This review process
also includes an evaluation of the Company&#146;s ability and intent to hold
individual securities until they mature or their full cost can be recovered. This review is
subjective and requires a high degree of judgment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Company&#146;s quarterly reviews of its marketable securities portfolio, during the
three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, the Company recorded charges for other-

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">than-temporary impairment of its marketable securities totaling $1.7&nbsp;million and $2.3&nbsp;million,
respectively, as described below. However, the current economic environment, the deterioration in
the credit quality of some of the issuers of securities that the Company holds, and the recent
volatility of securities markets increase the risk that there may be further declines in the market
value of marketable securities in the Company&#146;s investment portfolio and that such declines may
result in additional charges against income in future periods for other-than-temporary impairments,
and such amounts may be material.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued SFAS 157, <I>Fair
Value Measurements</I>. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 as of
January&nbsp;1, 2008, for financial instruments. Although the adoption of SFAS 157 did not materially
impact the Company&#146;s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company is now
required to provide additional disclosures as part of its financial statements. In addition, in
October&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (&#147;FSP&#148;) 157-3, <I>Determining the Fair Value of a
Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active, </I>which clarifies the application of
SFAS 157 in a market that is not active. FSP 157-3 also reaffirms the notion of fair value as an
exit price as of the measurement date. FSP 157-3 was effective upon issuance for financial
statements that have not yet been issued and adopted by the Company for the quarter ended September
30, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in
measuring fair value. The three tiers are Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted
prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets
that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in
which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
assumptions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and subject to the
disclosure requirements of SFAS 157 at September&nbsp;30, 2008, were as follows:

charge related to this Level 2 marketable security, which the Company considered to be other than
temporarily impaired.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2008, the Company and Cellectis S.A. (&#147;Cellectis&#148;) entered into an Amended and
Restated Non-Exclusive License Agreement (the &#147;License Agreement&#148;). The License Agreement resolves
a dispute between the parties related to the interpretation of a license agreement entered into by
the parties in December&nbsp;2003 pursuant to which the Company licensed certain patents and patent
applications from Cellectis. Pursuant to the License Agreement, in
July&nbsp;2008, the Company made a non-refundable $12.5&nbsp;million payment to Cellectis (the &#147;License
Payment&#148;) and agreed to pay Cellectis a low single-digit royalty based on revenue received by the
Company from any future licenses or sales of the Company&#146;s <I>VelociGene</I><SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> or
<I>VelocImmune</I><SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> products and services. No royalties are payable with respect to the
Company&#146;s <I>VelocImmune </I>license agreements with AstraZeneca UK Limited (&#147;AstraZeneca&#148;) and Astellas
Pharma Inc. (&#147;Astellas&#148;) or the Company&#146;s November&nbsp;2007 collaboration with sanofi-aventis.
Moreover, no royalties are payable on any revenue from commercial sales of antibodies from the
Company&#146;s <I>VelocImmune </I>technology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company began amortizing the License Payment in the second quarter of 2008 in proportion
to past and future anticipated revenues under the Company&#146;s license agreements with AstraZeneca and
Astellas and the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement under the Company&#146;s November&nbsp;2007
collaboration with sanofi-aventis. During the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, the
Company recognized $0.5&nbsp;million and $2.2&nbsp;million, respectively, of expense in connection with the
License Payment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2008, the Company and Cellectis also entered into a Subscription Agreement pursuant to

8.63 per share (which is equivalent to $12.15 at the September&nbsp;30<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP> EUR exchange rate).

sanofi-aventis to discover, develop, and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies, in August
2008, the Company entered into a separate agreement with sanofi-aventis to use Regeneron&#146;s
proprietary <I>VelociGene </I>technology platform to supply sanofi-aventis with genetically modified
mammalian models of gene function and disease. The agreement provides for minimum annual order
quantities for the term of the agreement which extends through December&nbsp;2012, for which Regeneron
expects to receive payments totaling a minimum of $21.5&nbsp;million. This aggregate minimum amount is
being recognized as contract research and development revenue in accordance with SAB 104 and
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.&nbsp;00-21, <I>Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables </I>(&#147;EITF 00-21&#148;). For the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, the Company

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, the Company implemented a tax planning strategy
to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards (which were otherwise due to expire in 2008 through
2012) on its 2007 U.S. Federal and New York State income tax returns that were filed in the third
quarter of 2008. The tax planning strategy included electing, for tax purposes only, to capitalize
$142.1&nbsp;million of 2007 research and development (R&#038;D) costs and to amortize these costs over ten
years for tax purposes. By capitalizing these R&#038;D costs, the Company was able to generate taxable
income in 2007 and utilize the net operating loss carry-forwards to offset this taxable income. As
a result, the Company incurred income tax expense of $3.1&nbsp;million for the three and nine months
ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, which relates to U.S. Federal and New York State alternative minimum tax
(&#147;AMT&#148;) and includes $0.2&nbsp;million of interest and penalties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company is primarily subject to U.S. Federal and New York State
income tax. The Company&#146;s effective income tax rate is generally 0%. The difference
between the Company&#146;s effective income tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 35% is
attributable to the use of net operating loss carry-forwards as well as state tax benefits and tax
credit carry-forwards offset by changes in the deferred tax valuation
allowance and the AMT discussed above.

establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative

establishes the appropriate income statement presentation and classification for joint operating
activities and payments between participants, as well as the sufficiency of the disclosures related

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and
commercializes pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions. We
currently have one marketed product: ARCALYST<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (rilonacept)&nbsp;Injection for Subcutaneous
Use, which is now available for prescription in the United States for the treatment of
Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), including Familial Cold Auto-inflammatory Syndrome
(FCAS)&nbsp;and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS)&nbsp;in adults and children 12 and older. We also have four
clinical development programs, including three late-stage clinical programs. The late stage
programs are aflibercept (VEGF Trap), which is being developed in oncology in collaboration with
the sanofi-aventis Group, VEGF Trap-Eye, which is being developed in eye diseases using intraocular
delivery in collaboration with Bayer HealthCare LLC, and ARCALYST<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (rilonacept; also
known as IL-1 Trap) which will enter Phase 3 studies in the first
half of 2009 both for the prevention
of gout flares induced by the initiation of urate-lowering drug
therapy used to control gout and in acute gout.
Our fourth clinical development program is REGN88, an antibody to the interleukin-6 receptor
(IL-6R) that is being developed with sanofi-aventis. REGN88 is in a Phase 1 clinical trial in
rheumatoid arthritis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that our next generation of product candidates will be based on our proprietary
technologies for developing human monoclonal antibodies. Our antibody program is being conducted
primarily in collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Our preclinical research programs are in the areas
of oncology and angiogenesis, ophthalmology, metabolic and related diseases, muscle diseases and
disorders, inflammation and immune diseases, bone and cartilage, pain, and cardiovascular diseases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our core business strategy is to maintain a strong foundation in basic scientific research and
discovery-enabling technology and combine that foundation with our manufacturing and clinical
development capabilities to build a successful, integrated biopharmaceutical company. However,
developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our ability to develop product candidates is enhanced by the application of
our technology platforms. Our discovery platforms are designed to identify specific genes of
therapeutic interest for a particular disease or cell type and validate targets through
high-throughput production of mammalian models. Our human monoclonal antibody technology
(<I>VelocImmune</I><SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"><B><I><SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP></I></B></SUP>) and cell line expression technologies may then be utilized to design and
produce new product candidates directed against the disease target. Based on the <I>VelocImmune</I>
platform which we believe, in conjunction with our other proprietary technologies, can accelerate
the development of fully human monoclonal antibodies, we moved our first antibody product candidate
(REGN88) into clinical trials in the fourth quarter of 2007. We plan
to file an Investigational New
Drug Application (IND) for an antibody to Delta-like ligand-4 (Dll4) by the end of 2008. We plan
to file an IND for a third antibody product candidate shortly thereafter, and to advance an average
of two to three antibody product candidates into clinical development each year. We continue to
invest in the development of enabling technologies to assist in our efforts to identify, develop,
and commercialize new product candidates.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2008, we received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)&nbsp;for ARCALYST<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"><FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#210;</FONT></SUP> (rilonacept)&nbsp;Injection for Subcutaneous Use for the treatment
of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), including Familial Cold Auto-inflammatory
Syndrome (FCAS)&nbsp;and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS)&nbsp;in adults and children 12 and older. In March
2008, ARCALYST became available for prescription in the United States and we began making shipments
to our distributors and transitioning the patients who participated in the CAPS pivotal study from
clinical study drug to commercial supplies. This transition has been mostly completed and we
currently project shipments of ARCALYST to our distributors to total approximately $10&nbsp;million in
2008. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2008, we shipped $4.3&nbsp;million and $6.7
million, respectively, of ARCALYST to our distributors. In July&nbsp;2008, we submitted a Marketing
Authorization Application (MAA)&nbsp;to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA)&nbsp;for ARCALYST for the
treatment of CAPS in the European Union.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARCALYST is a protein-based product designed to bind the interleukin-1 (called IL-1) cytokine
and prevent its interaction with cell surface receptors. ARCALYST is the only therapy approved in
the United States for patients with CAPS, a group of rare, inherited, auto-inflammatory conditions
characterized by life-long, recurrent symptoms of rash, fever/chills, joint pain, eye redness/pain,
and fatigue. Intermittent, disruptive exacerbations or flares can be triggered at any time by
exposure to cooling temperatures, stress, exercise, or other unknown stimuli. CAPS is caused by a
range of mutations in the gene NLRP3 (formerly known as <I>CIAS1</I>) which encodes a protein named
cryopyrin. In addition to FCAS and MWS, CAPS includes Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory
Disease (NOMID). ARCALYST has not been studied for the treatment of NOMID.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>1. Aflibercept (VEGF Trap) &#151; Oncology</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aflibercept is a protein-based product candidate designed to bind all forms of Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor-A (called VEGF-A, also known as Vascular Permeability Factor or VPF) and
the related Placental Growth Factor (called PlGF), and prevent their interaction with cell surface
receptors. VEGF-A (and to a less validated degree, PlGF) is required for the growth of new blood
vessels (a process known as angiogenesis) that are needed for tumors to grow and is a potent
regulator of vascular permeability and leakage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aflibercept is being developed in cancer indications in collaboration with sanofi-aventis. We
and sanofi-aventis currently are enrolling patients in four Phase 3 trials that combine aflibercept
with standard chemotherapy regimens. One trial is evaluating aflibercept as a 2<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">nd</SUP>
line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (the VELOUR study) in combination with FOLFIRI
(folinic acid (leucovorin), 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan). A second trial is evaluating
aflibercept as a 1<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">st</SUP> line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer in combination with
gemcitabine (the VANILLA study). A third trial is evaluating aflibercept as a 1<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">st</SUP> line
treatment for metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer in combination with
docetaxel/prednisone (the VENICE study). The fourth trial is evaluating aflibercept as a
2<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">nd</SUP> line treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in combination with
docetaxel (the VITAL study). All four trials are studying the current standard of chemotherapy
care for the cancer being studied with and without aflibercept. In addition, a Phase 2 study of
aflibercept in 1st-line metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with folinic acid (leucovirin),
5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin is expected to begin by the end of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aflibercept is also being studied in a Phase 2 single-agent study in advanced ovarian cancer
(AOC)&nbsp;patients with symptomatic malignant ascites (SMA). This
trial is more than 90% enrolled and patients continue to be enrolled in the study. A separate non-blinded single-agent
aflibercept study in 16 AOC patients with SMA has been completed and the results are currently
being evaluated. In 2004, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to aflibercept for the treatment
of SMA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanofi-aventis has also expanded the aflibercept development program to Japan, where they are
conducting Phase 1 safety and tolerability studies in combination with standard chemotherapies in
patients with advanced solid malignancies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, multiple exploratory studies are currently underway or scheduled to begin that
are being or will be conducted in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute (NCI)&nbsp;Cancer
Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP)&nbsp;evaluating aflibercept as a single agent or in combination with
chemotherapy regimens in a variety of cancer indications. At the 2008 annual meeting of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), investigators reported preliminary results of an
NCI-sponsored study of single-agent aflibercept in 48 patients with either relapsed or first
recurrence temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic glioma. As assessed by the
investigators, responses were achieved in 50% of patients with anaplastic glioma

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">and 30% of patients with glioblastoma. As assessed by an independent radiological
reading center, preliminary data indicates that responses were
achieved in approximately 30%
of patients with anaplastic glioma and 22% of patients with glioblastoma. Grade 3 adverse
events in this study included fatigue, hypertension, hand-foot syndrome, lymphopenia, thrombosis,
and proteinuria.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2008, at the 2008 ASCO Breast Cancer Symposium, investigators reported the
results of a small, exploratory NCI-sponsored study in 21 patients with poor prognostic
characteristics (i.e., tumors resistant to anthracyclines and/or taxanes and a majority with
metastatic visceral disease). In this trial, single-agent aflibercept had a confirmed partial
response rate, as assessed by the investigators, of 5% (with a 95% Confidence Interval of 0-24%), a
median progression free survival (PFS)&nbsp;of 2.7&nbsp;months, and a median overall survival (OS)&nbsp;of 10.8
months. There were no unexpected safety concerns in this small study. The investigators reported
that there were two cases of congestive heart failure in patients at high risk.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Aventis Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (predecessor to sanofi-aventis U.S.) to collaborate on the development and commercialization
of aflibercept in all countries other than Japan, where we retained the exclusive right to develop
and commercialize aflibercept. In January&nbsp;2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended the collaboration
agreement to exclude, from the scope of the collaboration, the development and commercialization of
aflibercept for intraocular delivery to the eye. In December&nbsp;2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended
our collaboration agreement to expand the territory in which the companies are collaborating on the
development of aflibercept to include Japan. Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, we and
sanofi-aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits on sales, if any, of aflibercept outside
of Japan for disease indications included in our collaboration. In Japan, we are entitled to a
royalty of approximately 35% on annual sales of aflibercept, subject to certain potential
adjustments. We may also receive up to $400.0&nbsp;million in milestone payments upon receipt of
specified marketing approvals. This total includes up to $360.0&nbsp;million in milestone payments
related to receipt of marketing approvals for up to eight aflibercept oncology and other
indications in the United States or the European Union. Another $40.0&nbsp;million of milestone
payments relate to receipt of marketing approvals for up to five oncology indications in Japan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the aflibercept collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed upon worldwide development
expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement will be funded by
sanofi-aventis. If the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse
sanofi-aventis for 50% of aflibercept development expenses in accordance with a formula based on
the amount of development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits and Japan royalties,
or at a faster rate at our option.

also developing VEGF Trap-Eye in diabetic macular edema (DME)&nbsp;and plan to initiate a Phase 2 study
in patients with DME in early 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Phase 3 trials in wet AMD, known as VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 (<U>V</U>EGF Trap:

Genetech, Inc.), an anti-angiogenic agent approved for use in wet AMD. VIEW 1 is being conducted in
North America and VIEW 2 is being conducted in Europe, Asia Pacific, Japan and Latin America. The
VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 trials are both evaluating dosing intervals of four and eight weeks for VEGF
Trap-Eye compared with ranibizumab dosed according to its U.S. label every four weeks over the
first year. As needed dosing (PRN)&nbsp;with both agents will be evaluated in the second year of the
studies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August&nbsp;2008, we and Bayer HealthCare AG announced the preliminary results of a Phase 2
study in wet AMD which demonstrated that patients treated with the VEGF Trap-Eye achieved durable
improvements in visual acuity and retinal thickness for up to one year in wet AMD. In September
2008, the complete results of this study, including additional data on reductions in the active
choroidal neovascularization lesion size, were reported at the 2008 annual meeting of the Retina
Society in Scottsdale, Arizona.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this double-masked Phase 2 trial, patients were initially treated with either fixed monthly
or quarterly dosing for 12&nbsp;weeks and then continued to receive treatment for another 40&nbsp;weeks on a
PRN dosing schedule. Patients receiving monthly doses of VEGF Trap-Eye of either 2.0 or 0.5
milligrams (mg)&nbsp;for 12&nbsp;weeks followed by PRN dosing achieved mean improvements in visual acuity
versus baseline of 9.0 letters (p&#060;0.0001 versus baseline) and 5.4 letters (p&#060;0.085 versus
baseline), respectively, at the end of one year. The proportion of patients with vision of 20/40 or
better (part of the legal minimum requirement for an unrestricted driver&#146;s license in the U.S.)
increased from 23% at baseline to 45% at week 52 in patients initially treated with
2.0 mg monthly and from 16% at baseline to 47% at week 52 in patients initially
treated with 0.5 mg monthly.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients receiving monthly doses of VEGF Trap-Eye of either 2.0 or 0.5 mg for 12&nbsp;weeks
followed by PRN dosing also achieved mean decreases in retinal thickness versus baseline of 143
microns (p&#060;0.0001 versus baseline) and 125 microns (p&#060;0.0001 versus baseline) at week 52,
respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the week 12 to week 52 PRN dosing period, patients initially dosed on a 2.0 mg monthly
schedule received, on average, only 1.6 additional injections and those initially dosed on a 0.5 mg
monthly schedule received, on average, 2.5 additional injections.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VEGF-A both stimulates angiogenesis and increases vascular permeability. It has been shown in
preclinical studies to be a major pathogenic factor in both wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy, and
it is believed to be involved in other medical problems affecting the eyes. Wet AMD and diabetic
retinopathy (which includes DME) are two of the leading causes of adult blindness in the developed
world. In both conditions, severe visual loss is caused by a combination of retinal edema and
neovascular proliferation.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer HealthCare for the
global development and commercialization outside the United States of VEGF Trap-Eye. Under the
agreement, we and Bayer HealthCare will collaborate on, and share the costs of, the development of
VEGF Trap-Eye through an integrated global plan that encompasses wet AMD, diabetic eye diseases,
and other diseases and disorders. Bayer HealthCare will market VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United
States, where the companies will share equally in profits from any future sales of VEGF Trap-Eye.
If VEGF Trap-Eye is granted marketing authorization in a major market country outside the United
States, we will be obligated to reimburse Bayer HealthCare for 50% of the development costs that it
has incurred under the agreement from our share of the collaboration profits. Within the United
States, we retain exclusive commercialization rights to VEGF Trap-Eye and are entitled to all
profits from any such sales. We received an up-front payment of $75.0&nbsp;million from Bayer
HealthCare. In 2007, we received a $20.0&nbsp;million milestone payment from Bayer HealthCare following

IL-1 may play an important role. In September&nbsp;2008, we announced the results of a Phase 2 study

per patient over the first 12&nbsp;weeks of urate-lowering therapy was 0.79 with placebo and 0.15 with
rilonacept (p=0.0011), an 81% reduction. This was the primary endpoint of the study. All
secondary endpoints also were met with statistical significance.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the first 12&nbsp;weeks of treatment, 45.2% of patients treated with placebo experienced
a gout flare and, of those, 47.4% had more than one flare. Among patients treated with

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gout is characterized by high blood levels of uric acid, a bodily waste product normally
excreted by the kidneys. The uric acid can form crystals in the joints of the toes, ankles, knees,
wrists, fingers, and elbows. Chronic treatment with uric acid-lowering medicines, such as
allopurinol, is prescribed to eliminate the uric acid crystals and prevent reformation. During the
first months of allopurinol therapy, while uric acid blood levels are being reduced, the break up
of the uric acid crystals can result in stimulation of inflammatory mediators, including IL-1,
resulting in acute flares of joint pain and inflammation. These painful flares generally persist
for at least five days.

these disease settings, blocking the action of secreted proteins can have clinical benefit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regeneron scientists have developed two different technologies to design protein therapeutics
to block the action of specific secreted proteins. The first technology, termed the &#147;Trap&#148;

ARCALYST<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"><B><I><SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP></I></B></SUP>
(rilonacept) for the treatment of CAPS,
and our current clinical pipeline, including aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye, and ARCALYST in other

subsequent to receipt of marketing approval from the FDA in February&nbsp;2008. Costs for manufacturing
supplies of ARCALYST prior to receipt of FDA approval were recognized as research and development
expenses in the period that the costs were incurred. Therefore, these costs are not being included
in cost of goods sold when revenue is recognized from the sale of those supplies of ARCALYST. For
the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, ARCALYST cost of goods sold totaled $0.3

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanofi-aventis&#146; reimbursement of Regeneron&#146;s aflibercept expenses increased in the third
quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to higher clinical development
costs and higher costs related to manufacturing aflibercept clinical supplies. Recognition of
deferred revenue related to sanofi-aventis&#146; up-front aflibercept payments decreased in the third
quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 due to an extension of the estimated
performance period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized. As of September&nbsp;30, 2008,
$54.9&nbsp;million of the original $105.0&nbsp;million of up-front payments related to aflibercept was
deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third quarter of 2008, sanofi-aventis&#146; reimbursement of Regeneron&#146;s antibody expenses
consisted of $24.1&nbsp;million under the discovery agreement and $5.4&nbsp;million of development costs
related to REGN88 under the license agreement. Recognition of deferred revenue under the antibody
collaboration related to sanofi-aventis&#146; $85.0&nbsp;million up-front payment. As of September&nbsp;30, 2008,
$76.2&nbsp;million of this up-front payment was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future
periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with our VEGF Trap-Eye collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, through September
30, 2007, all payments received from Bayer HealthCare, including a $75.0&nbsp;million non-refundable,
up-front payment, a $20.0&nbsp;million milestone payment (which was received in August&nbsp;2007 and not
considered substantive), and cost sharing reimbursements were fully deferred and included in
deferred revenue. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2007, we determined the appropriate
accounting policy for payments from Bayer HealthCare and commenced recognizing previously deferred
payments and cost-sharing of our and Bayer HealthCare&#146;s 2007 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses in
our Statement of Operations through a cumulative catch-up. The $75.0&nbsp;million non-refundable,
up-front license payment and the $20.0&nbsp;million milestone payment are being recognized as contract
research and development revenue over the related estimated performance period in accordance with
SAB 104 and EITF 00-21. In periods when we recognize VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we
incur under the collaboration, we also recognize, as contract research and development revenue, the
portion of those VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that is reimbursable from Bayer HealthCare. In
periods when Bayer HealthCare incurs agreed upon VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that benefit
the collaboration and Regeneron, we also recognize, as additional research and development expense,
the portion of Bayer HealthCare&#146;s VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we are obligated to
reimburse. In the third quarter of 2008, we recognized contract research and development revenue
of $9.0&nbsp;million from Bayer HealthCare, consisting of (i) $3.3&nbsp;million related to the $75.0&nbsp;million
up-front payment and the $20.0&nbsp;million milestone payment, and (ii) $5.7&nbsp;million related to the
portion of our third quarter 2008 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that is reimbursable from
Bayer HealthCare. As of September&nbsp;30, 2008, $69.2&nbsp;million of the up-front and milestone payments
was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other contract research and development revenue includes $1.2&nbsp;million and $2.2&nbsp;million,
respectively, recognized in the third quarters of 2008 and 2007 in connection with our five-year
grant from the NIH, which we were awarded in September&nbsp;2006 as part of the NIH&#146;s Knockout Mouse
Project.

Astellas, each of the $20.0&nbsp;million annual non-refundable payments is deferred upon receipt and
recognized as revenue ratably over approximately the ensuing year of each agreement. In both the
third quarter of 2008 and 2007 we recognized $10.0&nbsp;million of technology licensing revenue related
to these agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described above, during the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, we recognized as revenue

    <TD>Under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, in periods when Bayer HealthCare incurs
VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses, we also recognize, as additional research and
development expense, the portion of its VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we are
obligated to reimburse. Bayer HealthCare provides us with estimated VEGF Trap-Eye
development expenses for the most recent interim fiscal quarter. Bayer HealthCare&#146;s
estimate is reconciled to its actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent interim
quarter and our portion of its VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we are obligated to
reimburse is adjusted accordingly. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we commenced recognizing
cost-sharing of our and Bayer Healthcare&#146;s VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses.</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount, as
described above. Clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to higher costs related to our
clinical development programs for (i)&nbsp;ARCALYST, which includes our Phase 2 gout flare prevention
clinical study, (ii)&nbsp;monoclonal antibodies, which includes REGN88 as well as clinical-related
preparatory activities for the Dll4 antibody, and (iii)&nbsp;VEGF Trap-Eye, which includes our VIEW 1
trial in wet AMD. Clinical manufacturing costs increased due primarily to higher expenses related
to VEGF Trap-Eye and monoclonal antibodies, including REGN88. These increases were partially
offset by a reduction in manufacturing costs associated with ARCALYST. Research and preclinical
development costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated with our antibody programs.
Occupancy and other operating costs increased principally as a result of our higher headcount and
our expanded research and development activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We budget our research and development costs by expense category, rather than by project. We
also prepare estimates of research and development cost for projects in clinical development, which
include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor, Non-cash Compensation
Expense, and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects,
and, under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, the portion of Bayer HealthCare&#146;s VEGF Trap-Eye
development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Our estimates of research and development
costs for clinical development programs are shown below:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug development and approval in the United States is a multi-step process regulated by the
FDA. The process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation, leading up to the submission of
an IND to the FDA which, if successful, allows the opportunity for study in humans, or clinical
study, of the potential new drug. Clinical development typically involves three phases of study:
Phase 1, 2, and 3. The most significant costs in clinical development are in Phase 3 clinical
trials, as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug development

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">process. Following successful completion of Phase 3 clinical trials for a biological product,
a biologics license application (or BLA) must be submitted to, and accepted by, the FDA, and the
FDA must approve the BLA prior to commercialization of the drug. It is not uncommon for the FDA to
request additional data following its review of a BLA, which can significantly increase the drug
development timeline and expenses. We may elect either on our own, or at the request of the FDA,
to conduct further studies that are referred to as Phase 3B and 4 studies. Phase 3B studies are
initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the BLA is under FDA review. These
studies are conducted under an IND. Phase 4 studies, also referred to as post-marketing studies,
are studies that are initiated and conducted after the FDA has approved a product for marketing.
In addition, as discovery research, preclinical development, and clinical programs progress,
opportunities to expand development of drug candidates into new disease indications can emerge. We
may elect to add such new disease indications to our development efforts (with the approval of our
collaborator for joint development programs), thereby extending the period in which we will be
developing a product. For example, we, and our collaborators, where applicable, continue to
explore further development of
ARCALYST<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"><FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#210;</FONT></SUP>
(rilonacept), aflibercept, and VEGF Trap-Eye in different disease
indications.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development, including uncertainties
related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development, uncertainties related to
the enrollment and performance of clinical trials, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in
the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate, and other risks and uncertainties
described in Item&nbsp;1A, &#147;Risk Factors&#148; under &#147;Risks Related to ARCALYST<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (rilonacept)&nbsp;and
the Development of Our Product Candidates,&#148; &#147;Regulatory and Litigation Risks,&#148; and &#147;Risks Related
to Commercialization of Products.&#148; The lengthy process of seeking FDA approvals, and subsequent
compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial
resources. Any failure by us to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could
materially adversely affect our business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a product and
the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, the estimated cost and scope of the
projects, and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, accurate
and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not
available. Similarly, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates
will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows. In the first quarter of 2008, we
received FDA approval for ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS, a group of rare, inherited
auto-inflammatory diseases. These rare diseases affect a very small group of people. As a result,
we can not predict whether the commercialization of ARCALYST in CAPS will result in a significant
net cash benefit to us.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $11.4&nbsp;million in the third quarter
of 2008 from $9.3&nbsp;million in the same period of 2007. In the third quarter of 2008, we incurred
selling expenses of $0.7&nbsp;million related to ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS. General and
administrative expenses increased in the third quarter of 2008 due to (i)&nbsp;higher compensation
expense due primarily to increases in administrative headcount to support our expanded research

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Cost of goods sold:</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described above, during the third quarter of 2008, we began recognizing revenue and cost of
goods sold from net product sales of
ARCALYST<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"><FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#210;</FONT></SUP>
(rilonacept). Cost of goods sold was $0.3&nbsp;million for the third
quarter of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Income and Expense:</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment income decreased to $3.7&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2008 from $5.8&nbsp;million in
the comparable quarter of 2007, due primarily to lower yields on our cash and marketable
securities. In addition, during the third quarter of 2008, deterioration in the credit quality of
a marketable security from one issuer subjected us to the risk of not being able to recover the
security&#146;s $2.0&nbsp;million carrying value. As a result, we recognized a $1.7&nbsp;million charge related
to this security, which we considered to be other than temporarily impaired, partially offset by
realized gains of $1.0&nbsp;million on sales of marketable securities during the third quarter of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest expense of $1.8&nbsp;million and $3.0&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2008 and 2007,
respectively, is attributable to our 5.5% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due October&nbsp;17,
2008. During the second and third quarters of 2008, we repurchased a total of $82.5&nbsp;million in
principal amount of these convertible notes for $83.3&nbsp;million. At September&nbsp;30, 2008, $117.5
million of the convertible notes remained outstanding and were subsequently repaid in full upon
their maturity in October&nbsp;2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Income Tax Expense:</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third quarter of 2008, we implemented a tax planning strategy which resulted in the
utilization of certain net operating loss carry-forwards for tax purposes that would otherwise have
expired over the next several years. As a result, we incurred income tax expense of $3.1&nbsp;million,
which relates to U.S. Federal and New York State alternative minimum tax and includes $0.2&nbsp;million
of interest and penalties.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reported a net loss of $51.2&nbsp;million, or $0.65 per share (basic and diluted), for the first
nine months of 2008 compared to a net loss of $92.5&nbsp;million, or $1.40 per share (basic and
diluted), for the same period of 2007. The decrease in net loss was principally due to revenues
earned in the first nine months of 2008 in connection with our antibody collaboration with
sanofi-aventis and our VEGF Trap-Eye collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, partially offset by
higher research and development expenses.

of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to higher clinical development costs and
higher costs related to manufacturing aflibercept clinical supplies, partially offset by lower
aflibercept preclinical development costs. Recognition of deferred revenue related to
sanofi-aventis&#146; up-front aflibercept payments decreased in the first nine months of 2008 compared
to the same period in 2007 due to an extension of the estimated performance period over which this
deferred revenue is being recognized.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first nine months of 2008, sanofi-aventis&#146; reimbursement of Regeneron&#146;s antibody
expenses consisted of $56.5&nbsp;million under the discovery agreement and $15.9&nbsp;million of development
costs related to REGN88, under the license agreement. Recognition of deferred revenue under the
antibody collaboration related to sanofi-aventis&#146; $85.0&nbsp;million up-front payment.

    <TD>Under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, in periods when Bayer HealthCare incurs
VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses, we also recognize, as additional research and

development expenses for the most recent interim fiscal quarter. Bayer HealthCare&#146;s
estimate is reconciled to its actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent interim

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount, as
described above. Clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to higher costs related to our
clinical development programs for
(i)&nbsp;ARCALYST<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"><FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#210;</FONT></SUP> (rilonacept), which includes our Phase 2 gout flare prevention
clinical study, (ii)&nbsp;monoclonal antibodies, which includes REGN88 as well as clinical-related
preparatory activities for the Dll4 antibody, and (iii)&nbsp;VEGF Trap-Eye, which includes our VIEW 1
trial in wet AMD. Clinical manufacturing costs increased due primarily to higher expenses related
to VEGF Trap-Eye and monoclonal antibodies, including REGN88 and the Dll4 antibody. These
increases were partially offset by a reduction in manufacturing costs associated with ARCALYST.
Research and preclinical development costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated with
our antibody programs. Occupancy and other operating costs increased principally as a result of our
higher headcount and our expanded research and development activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We budget our research and development costs by expense category, rather than by project. We
also prepare estimates of research and development cost for projects in clinical development, which
include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor, Non-cash Compensation
Expense, and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons described above under &#147;Research and Development Expenses&#148; for the three months
ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a
product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, the estimated cost and
scope of the projects, and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for
commercialization, accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product
candidates to market are not available. Similarly, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate
if our product candidates will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows. In the
first quarter of 2008, we received FDA approval for ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS, a group of
rare, inherited auto-inflammatory diseases. These rare diseases affect a very small group of
people. As a result, we can not predict whether the commercialization of ARCALYST in CAPS will
result in a significant net cash benefit to us.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $35.9&nbsp;million in the first nine
months of 2008 from $26.4&nbsp;million in the same period of 2007. In the first nine months of 2008, we
incurred $3.6&nbsp;million of selling expenses related to ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS. General
and administrative expenses increased in the first nine months of 2008 due to (i)&nbsp;higher
compensation expense due primarily to increases in administrative headcount to support our expanded
research and development activities, (ii)&nbsp;higher recruitment and related costs associated with
expanding our headcount, (iii)&nbsp;higher fees for professional services related to various general
corporate matters, and (iv)&nbsp;higher administrative facility-related costs.

million in the same period of 2007, due primarily to lower yields on our cash and marketable
securities. In addition, during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, deterioration in the
credit quality of marketable securities from two issuers subjected us to the risk of not being able
to recover the securities&#146; $2.8&nbsp;million carrying value. As a result, we recognized charges of $2.3

amount of these convertible notes for $83.3&nbsp;million. In connection with the repurchases, we
recognized a $0.9&nbsp;million loss on early extinguishment of debt, representing the premium paid on
the notes plus related unamortized debt issuance costs. At September&nbsp;30, 2008, $117.5&nbsp;million of
the convertible notes remained outstanding and were subsequently repaid in full upon their maturity
in October&nbsp;2008.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third quarter of 2008, we implemented a tax planning strategy which resulted in the
utilization of certain net operating loss carry-forwards for tax purposes that would otherwise have
expired over the next several years. As a result, we incurred income tax expense of $3.1&nbsp;million,
which relates to U.S. Federal and New York State alternative minimum tax and includes $0.2&nbsp;million
of interest and penalties.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Accounting for Fair Value of Financial Assets</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We consider our marketable securities, which consist primarily of U.S. government, corporate, and asset-backed securities, to be &#147;available-for-sale,&#148; as defined by SFAS 115,
<I>Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities</I>. These assets are carried at fair
value and the unrealized gains and losses are included in other accumulated comprehensive income
(loss)&nbsp;as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity. If the decline in the value of a
marketable security in our investment portfolio is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we write down
the security to its current fair value and recognize a loss that is charged against income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, we review our portfolio of marketable securities, using both
quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine if declines in fair value below cost are
other-than-temporary. Such factors include the length of time and the extent to which market value
has been less than cost, financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, recommendations
of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market, or industry trends. This review process
also includes an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold individual securities until they
mature or their full cost can be recovered. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of
judgment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our quarterly reviews of our marketable securities portfolio, during the three
and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, we recorded charges for other-than-temporary impairment
of our marketable securities totaling $1.7&nbsp;million and $2.3&nbsp;million, respectively. However, the
current economic environment, the deterioration in the credit quality of some of the issuers of
securities that we hold, and the recent volatility of securities markets increase the risk that
there may be further declines in the market value of marketable securities in our investment

periods for other-than-temporary impairments, and such amounts may be material.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)&nbsp;issued SFAS 157, <I>Fair Value
Measurements</I>. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. We adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 as of January&nbsp;1,
2008, for financial instruments. Although the adoption of SFAS 157 did not materially impact our
financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, we are now required to provide
additional disclosures as part of our financial statements. In addition, in October&nbsp;2008, the
FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP)&nbsp;157-3, <I>Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When
the Market for That Asset Is Not Active, </I>which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market
that is not active. FSP 157-3 also reaffirms the notion of fair value as an exit price as of the
measurement date. FSP 157-3 was effective upon issuance for financial statements that have not yet
been issued. We adopted FSP 157-3 for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in
measuring fair value. The three tiers are Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted
prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets
that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in
which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
assumptions. We have determined that the provisions of SFAS 157 are applicable to our marketable
securities, which totaled $376.5&nbsp;million as of September&nbsp;30, 2008. At September&nbsp;30, 2008, less
than 1% of our marketable securities represented Level 3 assets.
</DIV>

our equity securities, a private placement of convertible debt, purchases of our equity securities
by our collaborators, including sanofi-aventis, revenue earned under our past and present research

2007, primarily due to a higher receivable balance related to our antibody collaboration with
sanofi-aventis. Also, our deferred revenue balances at September&nbsp;30, 2008 decreased by $10.1
million, compared to end-of-year 2007, primarily due to the amortization of previously received
deferred payments under our collaborations with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare. This decrease
was partly offset by (i)&nbsp;the receipt of the $20.0&nbsp;million payments from AstraZeneca and Astella, as
described above, which were deferred and are being recognized ratably over the ensuing year, and
(ii)&nbsp;deferral of $3.8&nbsp;million of ARCALYST net product sales at September&nbsp;30, 2008, as described

end-of-year 2006, due, in part, to the initial $20.0&nbsp;million up-front payments received from each
of AstraZeneca and Astellas. These up-front payments have been recognized as revenue ratably over
approximately the ensuing year of each non-exclusive license agreement. In addition, for the first
nine months of 2007, the $20.0&nbsp;million development milestone payment received from Bayer HealthCare
in August&nbsp;2007 and reimbursements from Bayer HealthCare of our 2007 VEGF Trap-Eye development

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount we need to fund our operations will depend on various factors, including the status
of competitive products, sales of ARCALYST, the success of our research and development programs,
the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities, the status
of patents and other intellectual property rights, the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any
of our potential drug candidates, and the continuation, extent, and success of our collaborations
with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare. Clinical trial costs are dependent, among other things,
on the size and duration of trials, fees charged for services provided by clinical trial
investigators and other third parties, the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in
the trials, and for supplies, laboratory tests, and other expenses. The amount of funding that
will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical
programs and early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements, the duration and results of
clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate, and the

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates
primarily from our investment of available cash balances in U.S. government securities, corporate, and asset-backed securities. We do not believe we are materially exposed to
changes in interest rates. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative
instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. We estimated that a one percent
unfavorable change in interest rates would result in approximately a $1.7&nbsp;million and $2.2&nbsp;million
decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio at September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The decrease in the potential impact of an interest rate change at September&nbsp;30,
2008 compared to September&nbsp;30, 2007 is due primarily to decreases in our investment portfolio&#146;s
duration at the end of September&nbsp;30, 2008 versus September&nbsp;30, 2007.

minimum credit quality, maturity parameters, and concentration and diversification. Nonetheless,
deterioration of the credit quality of an investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us
to the risk of not being able to recover the full principal value of the security. In the second
half of 2007, we recognized a $5.9&nbsp;million charge related to marketable securities from two issuers
which we considered to be other than temporarily impaired in value. In the first nine months of
2008, an additional $0.5&nbsp;million impairment charge was recognized related to one of these

resources, including funding we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements, will
enable us to meet operating needs through at least 2012; however, one or more of our collaboration

totaled $376.5&nbsp;million, and represented 46% of our total assets at September&nbsp;30, 2008. These
assets are carried at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are included in other
accumulated comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity. If the
decline in the value of a marketable security in our investment portfolio is deemed to be
other-than-temporary, we write down the security to its current fair value and recognize a loss
that is charged against income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, we review our portfolio of marketable securities, using both
quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine if declines in fair value below cost are
other-than-temporary. Such factors include the length of time and the extent to which market value
has been less than cost, financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, recommendations
of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market, or industry trends. This review process
also includes an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold individual securities until they
mature or their full cost can be recovered. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of
judgment.

months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, we recorded charges for other-than-temporary impairment of our
marketable securities totaling $2.3&nbsp;million. However, the current economic environment, the
deterioration in the credit quality of some of the issuers of securities that we hold, and the
recent volatility of securities markets increase the risk that there may be further declines in the
market value of marketable securities in our investment portfolio and that such declines may result
in additional charges against income in future periods for other-than-temporary impairments, and
such amounts may be material.

tests and trials may not achieve favorable results for many reasons, including, among others,
failure of the product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy, the development of serious or
life-threatening adverse events (or side effects) caused by or connected with exposure to the
product candidate, difficulty in enrolling and maintaining subjects in the clinical trial, lack of
sufficient supplies of the product candidate or comparator drug, and the failure of clinical
investigators, trial monitors and other consultants, or trial subjects to comply with the trial
plan or protocol. A clinical trial may fail because it did not include a sufficient number of
patients to detect the endpoint being measured or reach statistical significance. A clinical trial
may also fail because the dose(s) of the investigational drug included in the trial were either too
low or too high to determine the optimal effect of the investigational drug in the disease setting.

cancer and our VEGF Trap-Eye candidate is being studied in diseases of the eye. There are many
potential safety concerns associated with significant blockade of vascular endothelial growth
factor, or VEGF. These serious and potentially life-threatening risks, based on the clinical and
preclinical experience of systemically delivered VEGF inhibitors, including the systemic delivery
of the VEGF Trap, include bleeding, intestinal perforation, hypertension, and proteinuria. These
serious side effects and other serious side effects have been reported in our systemic VEGF Trap
studies in cancer and diseases of the eye. In addition, patients given infusions of any protein,
including the VEGF Trap delivered through intravenous administration, may develop severe
hypersensitivity reactions or infusion reactions. Other VEGF blockers have reported side effects
that became evident only after large scale trials or after marketing approval and large number of
patients were treated. These include side effects that we have not yet seen in our trials such as
heart attack and stroke. These and other complications or side effects could harm the development
of aflibercept for the treatment of cancer or VEGF Trap-Eye for the treatment of diseases of the

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles faced by our
product candidates, the administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an immune
response, resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein. The antibodies
can have no effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein, or require that
higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect. In some cases, the antibody can cross react
with the patient&#146;s own proteins, resulting in an &#147;auto-immune&#148; type disease. Whether antibodies
will be created can often not be predicted from preclinical or clinical experiments, and their
detection or appearance is often delayed, so that there can be no assurance that neutralizing
antibodies will not be detected at a later date, in some cases even after pivotal clinical trials
have been completed. Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected
in patients with CAPS after treatment with ARCALYST. Nineteen of 55
subjects (35%) who received ARCALYST for at least 6&nbsp;weeks tested positive for treatment-emerging
binding antibodies on at least one occasion. To date, no side effects related to antibodies were
observed in these subjects and there were no observed effects on drug efficacy or drug levels. It
is possible that as we continue to test aflibercept and VEGF Trap-Eye with more sensitive assays in
different patient populations and larger clinical trials, we will find that subjects given
aflibercept and VEGF Trap-Eye develop antibodies to these product candidates, and may also
experience side effects related to the antibodies, which could adversely impact the development of
such candidates.

be challenged by third parties who file an opposition. Such opposition proceedings are increasingly
common in the European Union and are costly to defend. We have patent applications that are being

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before approving a new drug or biologic product, the FDA requires that the facilities at which
the product will be manufactured be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or
cGMP requirements. Manufacturing product candidates in compliance with these regulatory
requirements is complex, time-consuming, and expensive. To be successful, our products must be
manufactured for development, following approval, in commercial quantities, in compliance with
regulatory requirements, and at competitive costs. If we or any of our product collaborators or
third-party manufacturers, product packagers, or labelers are unable to maintain regulatory
compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions, including, among other things, refusal to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is substantial competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries from
pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and chemical companies. Many of our competitors have substantially
greater research, preclinical and clinical product development and manufacturing capabilities, and
financial, marketing, and human resources than we do. Our smaller competitors may also enhance
their competitive position if they acquire or discover patentable inventions, form collaborative
arrangements, or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even if we achieve product
commercialization, our competitors have achieved, and may continue to achieve, product
commercialization before our products are approved for marketing and sale.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genentech has an approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (beracizumab) (Genentech), on
the market for treating certain cancers and many different pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies are working to develop competing VEGF antagonists, including Novartis, OSI
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Pfizer, Inc. Many of these molecules are farther along in development
than aflibercept and may offer competitive advantages over our molecule. Novartis has an ongoing
Phase 3 clinical development program evaluating an orally delivered VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor
in different cancer settings. Each of Pfizer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (together with its
partner Bayer HealthCare) has received approval from the FDA to market and sell an oral medication
that targets tumor cell growth and new vasculature formation that fuels the growth of tumors. The
marketing approvals for Genentech&#146;s VEGF antagonist, Avastin<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (Genentech), and their
extensive, ongoing clinical development plan for Avastin<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (Genentech) in other cancer
indications, make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in clinical trials to support
aflibercept and to obtain regulatory approval of aflibercept in these cancer settings. This may
delay or impair our ability to successfully develop and commercialize aflibercept. In addition,
even if aflibercept is ever approved for sale for the treatment of certain cancers, it will be
difficult for our drug to compete against Avastin<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (Genentech) and the FDA approved
kinase inhibitors, because doctors and patients will have significant experience using these
medicines. In addition, an oral medication may be considerably less expensive for patients than a
biologic medication, providing a competitive advantage to companies that market such products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market for eye disease products is also very competitive. Novartis and Genentech are
collaborating on the commercialization and further development of a VEGF antibody fragment,
ranibizumab (Lucentis<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>), for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD)
and other eye indications that was approved by the FDA in June&nbsp;2006. Many other companies are
working on the development of product candidates for the potential treatment of wet AMD that act by
blocking VEGF, VEGF receptors, and through the use of soluble ribonucleic acids (sRNAs) that
modulate gene expression. In addition, ophthalmologists are using off-label a third-party
reformatted version of Genentech&#146;s approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>, with success for
the treatment of wet AMD. The National Eye Institute has initiated a Phase 3 trial comparing
Lucentis<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (Genentech) to Avastin<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (Genentech) in the treatment of wet AMD.
The marketing approval of Lucentis<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (Genentech) and the potential off-label use of
Avastin<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (Genentech) make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in our clinical
trials and successfully develop VEGF Trap-Eye. Even if VEGF Trap-Eye is ever approved for sale for
the treatment of eye diseases, it may be difficult for our drug to compete against
Lucentis<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (Genentech), because doctors and patients will have significant experience
using this medicine. Moreover, the relatively low cost of therapy with Avastin<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>

Biologics License Application with the FDA. Roche&#146;s IL-6 receptor antibody, other clinical

third-party payers cover only selected drugs, making drugs that are not preferred by such payer

drugs are subject to governmental control, and we may be unable to negotiate coverage, pricing, and
reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us. In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing
for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug
pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for
its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health
insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human
use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt
a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal
product on the market. Our results of operations may suffer if we are unable to market our products
in foreign countries or if coverage and reimbursement for our products in foreign countries is

termination of these restrictions upon the occurrence of certain events. Notwithstanding these

exists, the market price of our Common Stock could fall. Sales of Common Stock by our significant

    <TD>In July&nbsp;2008, through privately negotiated transactions, we repurchased $1,150,000 aggregate
principal amount of our 5.5% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due October&nbsp;17, 2008 (the
&#147;Notes&#148;). The redemption price was $1,005 per $1,000 principal amount outstanding, plus $13.29 of
accrued but unpaid interest per $1,000 principal amount outstanding. As previously disclosed in
our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June&nbsp;4, 2008,
our board of directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to the then remaining $150.0
million in outstanding Notes. The remaining $117.5&nbsp;million of outstanding Notes disclosed in the
table above were repaid in full upon their maturity in October&nbsp;2008.</TD>
