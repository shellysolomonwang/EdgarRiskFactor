of Regulation&nbsp;S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all information and disclosures necessary for
a presentation of the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the
opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of
normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company&#146;s financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows for such periods. The results of operations for any interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The December&nbsp;31, 2007
Condensed Balance Sheet data were derived from audited financial statements, but do not include all
disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes
thereto contained in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
late March&nbsp;2008, ARCALYST&#153; (rilonacept) became available for prescription in the United States for the
treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS)&nbsp;and the Company made its first
shipments of ARCALYST&#153; to its distributors. The Company will recognize revenue from product sales
in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;104, <I>Revenue Recognition </I>(&#147;SAB 104&#148;). Revenue
from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to
product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable,
collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations.&nbsp;
When recognized, revenues from product sales will be recorded net of applicable provisions for
prompt pay discounts, product returns, and estimated rebates. The Company will account for these
reductions in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.&nbsp;01-9, <I>Accounting for
Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor&#146;s Products)</I>
(&#147;EITF 01-9&#148;), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (&#147;SFAS&#148;) 48, <I>Revenue Recognition
When Right of Return Exists</I>, as applicable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Company has no historical return or rebate experience for ARCALYST&#153;, no product
sales revenue has been recognized in the first quarter of 2008, and revenue recognition has been
fully deferred until the right of return no longer exists and rebates have been processed, or until
the Company can reasonably estimate returns and rebates. At March&nbsp;31, 2008, deferred revenue
related to ARCALYST&#153; product sales totaled $0.8&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company began capitalizing inventory costs associated with commercial supplies of
ARCALYST&#153; (rilonacept) subsequent to receipt of marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(&#147;FDA&#148;) on February&nbsp;27, 2008. Costs for manufacturing supplies of ARCALYST&#153; prior to receipt of
FDA approval were recognized as research and development expenses in the period incurred;
therefore, these costs will not be included in cost of goods sold when those supplies of ARCALYST&#153;
are sold. At March&nbsp;31, 2008, inventoried costs related to ARCALYST&#153; were insignificant.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s basic and diluted net loss per share amounts have been computed by dividing net
loss by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and Class&nbsp;A Stock outstanding. Net
loss per share is presented on a combined basis, inclusive of Common Stock and Class&nbsp;A Stock
outstanding, as each class of stock has equivalent economic rights. For the three months ended
March&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, the Company reported net losses; therefore, no common stock equivalents
were included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for these periods, since such
inclusion would have been antidilutive. The calculations of basic and diluted net loss per share
are as follows:

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of 2008, the Company recognized $0.6&nbsp;million of compensation expense
related to Restricted Stock awards, the fair value of which is expensed, on a pro rata basis, over
the period that the restrictions on the shares lapse.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at March&nbsp;31, 2008 and December&nbsp;31, 2007 were

payable and accrued expenses at March&nbsp;31, 2007 and December&nbsp;31, 2006 were $0.6&nbsp;million and $0.8
million, respectively, of accrued capital expenditures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006 were $1.1
million and $1.4&nbsp;million, respectively, of accrued Company 401(k) Savings Plan contribution
expense. In the first quarter of 2008 and 2007, the Company contributed 58,575 and 64,532 shares,
respectively, of Common Stock to the 401(k) Savings Plan in satisfaction of these obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in marketable securities at March&nbsp;31, 2008 and December&nbsp;31, 2007 were $2.1&nbsp;million

March&nbsp;31, 2007 and December&nbsp;31, 2006 were $2.1&nbsp;million and $1.5&nbsp;million, respectively, of accrued

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;157</I></B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 157, <I>Fair Value
Measurements</I>. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 as of
January&nbsp;1, 2008, for financial instruments. Although the adoption of SFAS 157 did not materially
impact the Company&#146;s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company is now
required to provide additional disclosures as part of its financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in
measuring fair value. The three tiers are Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted
prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets
that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in
which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
assumptions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and
commercializes pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions. We
currently have one marketed product: ARCALYST<FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#212;</FONT> (rilonacept)&nbsp;Injection for Subcutaneous Use is
now available for prescription in the United States for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated
Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), including Familial Cold Auto-inflammatory Syndrome (FCAS)&nbsp;and
Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS)&nbsp;in adults and children 12 and older. We also have four clinical
development programs, including two late-stage clinical programs. The late stage programs are
aflibercept (VEGF Trap), which is being developed in oncology in collaboration with the
sanofi-aventis Group and VEGF Trap-Eye, which is being developed in eye diseases using intraocular
delivery in collaboration with Bayer HealthCare LLC. ARCALYST&#153; (rilonacept; also known as IL-1
Trap) is also in a Phase 2 safety and efficacy trial for the prevention of gout flares induced by
the initiation of uric acid-lowering drug therapy used to control gout. Our fourth clinical
development program is REGN88, an antibody to the Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) that is being
developed with sanofi-aventis. REGN88 entered clinical development in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis in the fourth quarter of 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that our next generation of product candidates will be based on our proprietary
technologies for developing human monoclonal antibodies. Our antibody program is being conducted
in collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Our preclinical research programs are in the areas of
oncology and angiogenesis, ophthalmology, metabolic and related diseases, muscle diseases and
disorders, inflammation and immune diseases, bone and cartilage, pain, and cardiovascular diseases.
Developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense. Since
inception we have not generated any sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our
product candidates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our core business strategy is to maintain a strong foundation in basic scientific research and
discovery-enabling technology and combine that foundation with our manufacturing and clinical
development capabilities to build a successful, integrated biopharmaceutical company. We believe
that our ability to develop product candidates is enhanced by the application of our

platforms. Our discovery platforms are designed to identify specific genes of therapeutic interest
for a particular disease or cell type and validate targets through high-throughput production of
mammalian models. Our human monoclonal antibody technology (<I>VelocImmune</I><SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"><B><I><SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP></I></B></SUP>) and cell line
expression technologies may then be utilized to design and produce new product candidates directed
against the disease target. Based on the <I>VelocImmune </I>platform which we believe, in conjunction
with our other proprietary technologies, can accelerate the development of fully human monoclonal
antibodies, we moved our first antibody product candidate (REGN88) into clinical trials in 2007.
We plan to advance two new antibody product candidates into clinical development in 2008 and an
additional two to three antibody
product candidates each year thereafter beginning in 2009. We continue to invest in the
development of enabling technologies to assist in our efforts to identify, develop, and
commercialize new product candidates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U><b>ARCALYST&#153; (rilonacept) &#150; Inflammatory Diseases:</b></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARCALYST&#153; (rilonacept; also known as IL-1 Trap) is a protein-based product designed to bind
the interleukin-1 (called IL-1) cytokine and prevent its interaction with cell surface receptors.
In February&nbsp;2008, we announced that we had received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)&nbsp;for ARCALYST&#153; Injection for Subcutaneous Use for the treatment of
Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), including Familial Cold Auto-inflammatory Syndrome
(FCAS)&nbsp;and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS)&nbsp;in adults and children 12 and older. In July&nbsp;2007,
ARCALYST&#153; for the treatment of CAPS received Orphan Drug designation in the European Union.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAPS represents a group of rare inherited auto-inflammatory conditions. In addition to FCAS
and MWS, CAPS includes Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID). ARCALYST&#153; has not
been studied for the treatment of NOMID. The syndromes included in CAPS are characterized by
spontaneous, systemic&nbsp;inflammation&nbsp;and are termed auto-inflammatory disorders. A novel feature of
these conditions (particularly FCAS and MWS) is that exposure to mild degrees of cold temperature
can provoke a major inflammatory episode that occurs within hours. CAPS is caused by a range of
mutations in the gene NLRP3 (formerly known as <I>CIAS1</I>) which encodes a protein named cryopyrin. &nbsp;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also evaluating ARCALYST&#153; in a number of diseases and disorders where IL-1 may play an
important role. We have initiated a Phase 2 safety and efficacy trial of ARCALYST&#153; in the
prevention of gout flares induced by the initiation of uric acid-lowering drug therapy used to
control gout. We previously reported positive results from an exploratory proof of concept study
of ARCALYST&#153; in ten patients with chronic active gout. In those patients, treatment with ARCALYST&#153;
demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in patient pain scores in the single-blind,
placebo-controlled study. Mean patients&#146; pain scores, the key symptom measure in persistent gout,
were reduced 41% (p=0.025) during the first two weeks of active treatment and reduced 56%
(p&#060;0.004) after six weeks of active treatment. In this study, in which safety was the primary
endpoint measure, treatment with ARCALYST&#153; was generally well-tolerated. We are also evaluating
the potential use of ARCALYST&#153; in other indications in which IL-1 may play a role.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aflibercept is a protein-based product candidate designed to bind all forms of Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor-A (called VEGF-A, also known as Vascular Permeability Factor or VPF) and
the related Placental Growth Factor (called PlGF), and prevent their interaction with cell surface
receptors. VEGF-A (and to a less validated degree, PlGF) is required for the growth of new blood
vessels that are needed for tumors to grow and is a potent regulator of vascular permeability and
leakage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aflibercept is being developed in cancer indications in collaboration with sanofi-aventis. We
and sanofi-aventis began four Phase 3 trials of aflibercept in the second half of 2007. One trial
is evaluating aflibercept as a 1<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">st</SUP> line treatment for metastatic androgen independent
prostate cancer in combination with docetaxel/prednisone. A second trial is evaluating aflibercept
as a 2<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">nd</SUP> line treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in combination with
docetaxel. The third Phase 3 trial is evaluating aflibercept as a 1<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">st</SUP> line treatment
for metastatic pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine. The fourth Phase 3 trial is
evaluating aflibercept as a 2<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">nd</SUP> line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer in
combination with FOLFIRI (Folinic Acid (leucovorin), 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan). In all of
these trials, aflibercept is being combined with the current standard of chemotherapy care for the
stated development stage of the cancer type.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collaboration is conducting a number of other trials in the global development program for
aflibercept. Five safety and tolerability studies of aflibercept in combination with standard
chemotherapy regimens are continuing in a variety of cancer types to support the Phase 3 clinical
program. Sanofi-aventis has also expanded the development program to Japan, where they are
conducting a Phase 1 safety and tolerability study in combination with another investigational
agent in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

ovarian cancer (AOC), non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLA), and AOC patients with symptomatic
malignant ascites (SMA). We expect to report results from the AOC trial in the second quarter of
2008 and the NSCLA trial by the end of the year. The SMA trial is approximately 50% enrolled and
continues to enroll patients. In 2004, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to aflibercept for
the treatment of SMA.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancer is a heterogeneous set of diseases and one of the leading causes of death in the
developed world. A mutation in any one of dozens of normal genes can eventually result in a cell
becoming cancerous; however, a common feature of cancer cells is that they need to obtain nutrients
and remove waste products, just as normal cells do. The vascular system normally supplies
nutrients to and
removes waste from normal tissues. Cancer cells can use the vascular system either by taking
over preexisting blood vessels or by promoting the growth of new blood vessels (a process known as
angiogenesis). Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)&nbsp;is secreted by many tumors to stimulate
the growth of new blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen to the tumor. VEGF blockers have
been shown to inhibit new vessel growth, and, in some cases, can cause regression of existing tumor
vasculature. Countering the effects of VEGF, thereby blocking the blood supply to tumors, has been
shown in clinical trials to have therapeutic benefits. This approach of inhibiting angiogenesis as
a mechanism of action for an oncology medicine was validated in February&nbsp;2004, when the FDA
approved Genentech, Inc.&#146;s VEGF inhibitor, Avastin<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>. Avastin<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (a trademark

supply to tumors.

visual acuity gain established during the fixed-dosing period. Notably, 55% of the patients who
received 2.0 mg monthly for 12&nbsp;weeks did not require any additional treatment throughout the next
20-week PRN dosing period. Moreover, 97% of the patients who received 2.0 mg monthly for 12

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way that a cell communicates with other cells is by releasing specific signaling proteins,
either locally or into the bloodstream. These proteins have distinct functions, and are classified
into different &#147;families&#148; of molecules, such as peptide hormones, growth factors, and cytokines.
All of these secreted (or signaling) proteins travel to and are recognized by another set of
proteins, called &#147;receptors,&#148; which reside on the surface of responding cells. These secreted
proteins impact many critical cellular and biological processes, causing diverse effects ranging
from the regulation of growth of particular cell types, to inflammation mediated by white blood
cells. Secreted proteins can at times be overactive and thus result in a variety of diseases. In
these disease settings, blocking the action of secreted proteins can have clinical benefit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regeneron scientists have developed two different technologies to design protein therapeutics
to block the action of specific secreted proteins. The first technology, termed the &#147;Trap&#148;
technology, was used to generate our first approved product,
ARCALYST&#153; (rilonacept) for the treatment of CAPS,
and our current clinical pipeline, including aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye, and ARCALYST&#153; in other
indications. These novel &#147;Traps&#148; are composed of fusions between two distinct receptor components
and the constant region of an antibody molecule called the &#147;Fc region&#148;, resulting in high affinity
product candidates.

cumulative loss of $804.8&nbsp;million. As described above, in February&nbsp;2008, we received FDA approval
for ARCALYST&#153; (rilonacept) for the treatment of CAPS. These rare diseases affect a very small group of people.
As a result, we can not predict whether the commercialization of ARCALYST&#153; in CAPS will result in a
significant net cash benefit to us. In the absence of significant revenues from the
commercialization of our product candidates or other sources, the amount, timing, nature, and
source of which cannot be predicted, our losses will continue as we conduct our research and
development activities. We expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years as we
continue the clinical development of VEGF Trap-Eye and ARCALYST&#153; in other indications; advance new
product candidates into clinical development from our existing research programs utilizing our
technology for designing fully human monoclonal antibodies; continue our research and development
programs; and commercialize product candidates that receive regulatory approval, if any. Also, our
activities may expand over

(rilonacept) Product Revenue and Inventory</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late March&nbsp;2008, ARCALYST&#153; became available for prescription in the United States for the
treatment of CAPS and we made our first shipments of ARCALYST&#153; to our distributors. We will
recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;104, <I>Revenue
Recognition </I>(SAB 104). Revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the
price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no
further performance obligations.&nbsp; When recognized, revenues from product sales will be recorded net
of applicable provisions for prompt pay discounts, product returns, and estimated rebates. We will
account for these reductions in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.&nbsp;01-9,
<I>Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor&#146;s
Products) </I>(EITF 01-9), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS)&nbsp;48, <I>Revenue
Recognition When Right of Return Exists</I>, as applicable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we have no historical return or rebate experience for ARCALYST&#153;, no product sales
revenue has been recognized in the first quarter of 2008, and revenue recognition has been fully
deferred until the right of return no longer exists and rebates have been processed, or until we
can reasonably estimate returns and rebates. At March&nbsp;31, 2008, deferred revenue related to
ARCALYST&#153; product sales totaled $0.8&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We began capitalizing inventory costs associated with commercial supplies of ARCALYST&#153;
subsequent to receipt of marketing approval from the FDA on February&nbsp;27, 2008. Costs for
manufacturing supplies of ARCALYST&#153; prior to receipt of FDA approval were recognized as research
and development expenses in the period incurred; therefore, these costs will not be included in
cost of goods sold when those supplies of ARCALYST&#153; are sold. As a result, in 2008, we anticipate
that ARCALYST&#153; cost of goods sold will be insignificant. At March&nbsp;31, 2008, inventoried costs
related to ARCALYST&#153; were inconsequential.

diluted), for the first quarter of 2007. The decrease in the Company&#146;s net loss was principally
due to revenues earned in the first quarter of 2008 in connection with our antibody collaboration
with sanofi-aventis and our VEGF Trap-Eye collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, partly offset by
higher research and development expenses.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanofi-aventis&#146; reimbursement of Regeneron&#146;s aflibercept expenses increased in the first
quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to higher costs related to our
manufacture of aflibercept clinical supplies and higher clinical development costs. Recognition of
deferred revenue related to sanofi-aventis&#146; up-front aflibercept payments decreased in the first
quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 due to an extension of the estimated
performance period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized. As of March&nbsp;31, 2008,
$59.1&nbsp;million of the original $105.0&nbsp;million of up-front payments related to aflibercept was
deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of 2008, sanofi-aventis&#146; reimbursement of Regeneron&#146;s antibody expenses
consisted of $15.1&nbsp;million under the collaboration&#146;s discovery agreement and $4.2&nbsp;million of REGN88
development costs under the license agreement. Recognition of deferred revenue under the antibody
collaboration related to sanofi-aventis&#146; $85.0&nbsp;million up-front payment. As of March&nbsp;31, 2008,
$81.5&nbsp;million of this up-front payment was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future
periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with our VEGF Trap-Eye collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, through September
30, 2007, all payments received from Bayer HealthCare, including a $75.0&nbsp;million non-refundable,
up-front payment, a $20.0&nbsp;million milestone payment (which was received in August&nbsp;2007 and not
considered substantive), and cost sharing reimbursements were fully deferred and included in
deferred revenue. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2007, we determined the appropriate
accounting policy for
payments from Bayer HealthCare and commenced recognizing previously deferred payments and
cost-sharing of our and Bayer HealthCare&#146;s 2007 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses in our Statement
of Operations through a cumulative catch-up. The $75.0&nbsp;million non-refundable, up-front license
payment and the $20.0&nbsp;million milestone payment are being recognized as contract research and
development revenue over the related estimated performance period in accordance with SAB 104 and
EITF 00-21. In periods when we recognize VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we incur under
the collaboration, we also recognize, as contract research and development revenue, the portion of
those VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that is reimbursable from Bayer HealthCare. In periods
when Bayer HealthCare incurs agreed upon VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that benefit the
collaboration and Regeneron, we also recognize, as additional research and development expense, the
portion of Bayer HealthCare&#146;s VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we are obligated to
reimburse. In the first quarter of 2008, we recognized contract research and development revenue
of $9.0&nbsp;million from Bayer HealthCare, consisting of (i) $3.3&nbsp;million related to the $75.0&nbsp;million
up-front licensing payment and the $20.0&nbsp;million milestone payment, and (ii) $5.7&nbsp;million related
to the portion of our first quarter 2008 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that is reimbursable
from Bayer HealthCare. As of March&nbsp;31, 2008, $75.8&nbsp;million of the up-front licensing and milestone
payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other contract research and development revenue includes $1.1&nbsp;million and $0.7&nbsp;million,
respectively, recognized in the first quarter of 2008 and 2007 in connection with our five-year
grant from the NIH, which we were awarded in September&nbsp;2006 as part of the NIH&#146;s Knockout Mouse
Project.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with our license agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas, each of the $20.0
million annual, non-refundable payments are deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue ratably
over approximately the ensuing year of each agreement. In the first quarter of 2008 and 2007, we
recognized $10.0&nbsp;million and $2.1&nbsp;million, respectively, of technology licensing revenue related to
these agreements.

    <TD>Under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, in periods when Bayer HealthCare incurs
VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses, we also recognize, as additional research and
development expense, the portion of their VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we are
obligated to reimburse. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we commenced recognizing
cost-sharing of our and Bayer Healthcare&#146;s VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses.</TD>

</TABLE>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount, as
described above. Clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to higher costs related to our
Phase 3 study of VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD, which we initiated in the third quarter of 2007, and
higher ARCALYST&#153;<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"> </SUP>costs, primarily related to our Phase 2 gout-induced flares clinical
study. These increases were partially offset by lower costs related to our Phase 1 and 2 studies
of VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD. Clinical manufacturing costs increased due primarily to higher
expenses related to aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye, and our Dll4 antibody, partially offset by lower
costs related to ARCALYST&#153; and REGN88. Research and preclinical development costs decreased
primarily due to lower preclinical costs associated with aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye, and REGN88,
partially offset by higher costs related to our Dll4 antibody. Occupancy and other operating
costs primarily increased in connection with our higher headcount and to support our expanded
research and development activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We budget our research and development costs by expense category, rather than by project. We
also prepare estimates of research and development cost for projects in clinical development, which
include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor, Non-cash Compensation
Expense, and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects,
and, under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, the portion of Bayer HealthCare&#146;s VEGF Trap-Eye
development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Our estimates of research and development
costs for clinical development programs (including ARCALYST&#153; for the treatment of CAPS prior to
receipt of marketing approval from the FDA in February&nbsp;2008) are shown below:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug development and approval in the United States is a multi-step process regulated by the
FDA. The process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation, leading up to the submission of
an IND to the FDA which, if successful, allows the opportunity for study in humans, or clinical

license application (or BLA) must be submitted to, and accepted by, the FDA, and the FDA must
approve the BLA prior to commercialization of the drug. It is not uncommon for the FDA to request
additional data following its review of a BLA, which can significantly increase the drug
development timeline and expenses. We may elect either on our own, or
at the request of the FDA, to conduct further studies that are referred to as Phase 3B and 4
studies. Phase 3B studies are initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the
BLA is under FDA review. These studies are conducted under an IND. Phase 4 studies, also referred
to as post-marketing studies, are studies that are initiated and conducted after the FDA has
approved a product for marketing. In addition, as discovery research, preclinical development, and
clinical programs progress, opportunities to expand development of drug candidates into new disease
indications can emerge. We may elect to add such new disease indications to our development
efforts (with the approval of our collaborator for joint development programs), thereby extending
the period in which we will be developing a product. For example, we, and our collaborators, where
applicable, continue to explore further development of ARCALYST&#153; (rilonacept), aflibercept, and VEGF Trap-Eye in
different disease indications.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development, including uncertainties
related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development, uncertainties related to
the enrollment and performance of clinical trials, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in
the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate, and other risks and uncertainties
described in Item&nbsp;1A, &#147;Risk Factors&#148; under &#147;Risks Related to ARCALYST&#153; and the Development of Our
Product Candidates,&#148; &#147;Regulatory and Litigation Risks,&#148; and &#147;Risks Related to Commercialization of
Products.&#148; The lengthy process of seeking FDA approvals, and subsequent compliance with applicable
statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to
obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a product and
the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, the estimated cost and scope of the
projects, and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, accurate
and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not
available. Similarly, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates
will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows. In the first quarter of 2008, we
received FDA approval for ARCALYST&#153; for the treatment of CAPS, a group of rare, inherited
auto-inflammatory diseases. These rare diseases affect a very small group of people. As a result,
we can not predict whether the commercialization of ARCALYST&#153; in CAPS will result in a significant
net cash benefit to us.

incurred (i)&nbsp;higher compensation expense due primarily to increases in selling and administrative

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.&nbsp;157</I></B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 157, <I>Fair Value
Measurements</I>. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. We adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 as of January&nbsp;1,
2008, for financial instruments. Although the adoption of SFAS 157 did not materially impact our
financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, we are now required to provide
additional disclosures as part of our financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in
measuring fair value. The three tiers are Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted
prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets
that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in
which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
assumptions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have determined that the provisions of SFAS 157 are applicable to our marketable
securities, which totaled $305.4&nbsp;million as of March&nbsp;31, 2008, and consisted of obligations of the
U.S. government and its agencies, investment grade debt securities issued by corporations,
governments and financial institutions, asset-backed securities, and commercial paper. All of our
marketable securities are considered to be &#147;available for sale,&#148; as defined by SFAS 115, <I>Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities</I>. At March&nbsp;31, 2008, less than 3% of our
marketable securities represented Level 3 assets, and our other marketable securities represented
Level 2 assets. During the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2008, there were no purchases, sales, or
maturities of Level 3 marketable securities, and no transfers of marketable securities between the
Level 2 and Level 3 classifications. We held no Level 1 marketable securities during the quarter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our methods for valuing our marketable securities are described in Note 5 to our condensed
financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. With respect to valuations
received from our investment advisors for pricing our Level 2 marketable securities, we review our
investment advisors&#146; policies and procedures for valuation. For valuations that we determine

marketable securities compared with $846.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2007. In February&nbsp;2008, we
received a $20.0&nbsp;million annual, non-refundable payment in connection with our non-exclusive

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At March&nbsp;31, 2008, accounts receivable increased by $14.6&nbsp;million, compared to end-of-year
2007, primarily due to higher receivable balances related to our collaborations with
sanofi-aventis. Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities decreased by $7.6
million at March&nbsp;31, 2008, compared to end-of-year 2007, due primarily to reductions in accrued
payroll costs and the amount of the cost-sharing payment due to Bayer HealthCare in connection with
the companies&#146; VEGF Trap-Eye collaboration.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At March&nbsp;31, 2007, accounts receivable balances increased by $26.1&nbsp;million, compared to
end-of-year 2006, primarily due to a $20.0&nbsp;million non-refundable, up-front payment which was
receivable in connection with our non-exclusive license agreement with Astellas. Our deferred
revenue balances at March&nbsp;31, 2007 increased by $37.7&nbsp;million, compared to end-of-year 2006,
primarily due to the initial $20.0&nbsp;million non-refundable, up-front payments received or receivable
from AstraZeneca and Astellas as of March&nbsp;31, 2007. These initial up-front payments have been
recognized as revenue ratably over approximately the ensuing year of each non-exclusive license

incur approximately $55 to $65&nbsp;million in capital expenditures primarily in connection with
expanding our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer, New York facilities and tenant improvements
and related costs in connection with our new Tarrytown operating lease. We expect that
approximately $30&nbsp;million of projected 2008 Tarrytown tenant improvement costs will be reimbursed
by our landlord in connection with our new operating lease. We currently anticipate that other
2008 capital expenditures will be funded from our existing capital resources.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, we issued $200.0&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior
subordinated notes, which bear interest at 5.5% per annum, payable semi-annually, and mature in
October&nbsp;2008. The notes are convertible into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of
approximately $30.25 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. If the price per
share of our Common Stock is above $30.25 at maturity, we would expect the notes to convert into
shares of Common Stock. Otherwise, we will be required to repay the $200.0&nbsp;million aggregate
principal amount of the notes from our existing capital resources or refinance the notes prior to
maturity; however, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully arrange such
refinancing.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements primarily for research and
development activities (including preclinical and clinical testing). Before taking into account
reimbursements from collaborators and potential repayment of our convertible debt (as described
above), and exclusive of product revenues and costs in connection
with ARCALYST&#153; (rilonacept) for the treatment
of CAPS, we currently anticipate that approximately 55-65% of our expenditures for 2008 will be
directed toward the preclinical and clinical development of product candidates, including ARCALYST&#153;
in other indications, aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye, and monoclonal antibodies (including REGN88 and
the Dll4 antibody); approximately 15-20% of our expenditures for 2008 will be applied to our basic
research and early preclinical activities, and the remainder of our expenditures for 2008 will be
used for the continued development of our novel technology platforms, capital expenditures, and
general corporate purposes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently
anticipate that in 2008 the commercialization of ARCALYST&#153; (rilonacept) for the treatment of
CAPS will not materially enhance or otherwise materially impact the Company&#146;s cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount we need to fund our operations will depend on various factors, including the status
of competitive products, sales of ARCALYST&#153;, the success of our research and development programs,
the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities, the status
of patents and other intellectual property rights, the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any
of our potential drug candidates, and the continuation, extent, and success of our collaborations
with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare. Clinical trial costs are dependent, among other things,
on the size and duration of trials, fees charged for services provided by clinical trial
investigators and other third parties, the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in
the trials, and for supplies, laboratory tests, and other expenses. The amount of funding that
will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical
programs and early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements, the duration and results of
clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate, and the
various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above. In the future, if we are
able to successfully develop, market, and sell certain of our product candidates, we may be
required to pay royalties or otherwise share the profits generated on such sales in connection with
our collaboration and licensing agreements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that expenses related to the filing, prosecution, defense, and enforcement of patent

filings and prosecutions in the United States and foreign countries.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our existing capital resources, including funding we are entitled to receive
under our collaboration and licensing agreements, will enable us to meet operating needs through at
least 2012. However, this is a forward-looking statement based on our current operating plan, and
there may be a change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being
consumed significantly before such time. If there is insufficient capital to fund all of our
planned operations and activities, we believe we would prioritize available capital to fund the
commercialization of ARCALYST&#153; and the cost of preclinical and clinical development of our product
candidates. Other than letters of credit totaling $1.7&nbsp;million, including a $1.6&nbsp;million letter of
credit issued to our landlord in connection with our new operating lease for facilities in
Tarrytown, New York, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. In addition, we do not guarantee
the obligations of any other entity. As of March&nbsp;31, 2008, we had no established banking
arrangements through which we could obtain short-term financing or a line of credit. In the event
we need additional financing for the operation of our business, we will consider collaborative
arrangements and additional public or private financing, including additional equity financing.
Factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product
development, investor perception of our prospects, and the general condition of the financial
markets. We may not be able to secure the necessary funding through new collaborative arrangements
or additional public or private offerings. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our
capital requirements, we may have to delay, scale-back, or eliminate certain of our research and
development activities or future operations. This could materially harm our business.

primarily from our investment of available cash balances in investment grade corporate,

changes in interest rates. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative
instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. We estimated that a one percent
unfavorable change in interest rates would result in approximately a $1.8&nbsp;million decrease in the
fair value of our investment portfolio at both March&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007.

minimum credit quality, maturity parameters, and concentration and diversification. Nonetheless,
deterioration of the credit quality of an investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us

require additional financing in the future and we may not be able to raise such additional funds.
If we are able to obtain additional financing through the sale of equity or convertible debt
securities, such sales may be dilutive to our shareholders. Debt financing arrangements may require
us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that would restrict our business activities or
our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our
shareholders. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds to complete the development of our product

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in
commercially successful drugs. Even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and effectiveness of any
of our product candidates for a specific disease and the necessary regulatory approvals are
obtained, the commercial success of any of our product candidates will depend upon their acceptance
by patients, the medical community, and third-party payers and on our partners&#146; ability to
successfully manufacture and commercialize our product candidates. Our product candidates are
delivered either by intravenous infusion or by intravitreal or subcutaneous injections, which are
generally less well received by patients than tablet or capsule delivery. If our products are not
successfully commercialized, we will not be able to recover the significant investment we have made
in developing such products and our business would be severely harmed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are studying aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye, and ARCALYST&#153;, in a wide variety of indications.
We are studying aflibercept in a variety of cancer settings, VEGF Trap-Eye in different eye
diseases and ophthalmologic indications, and ARCALYST&#153; in a variety of systemic inflammatory
disorders. Many of these current trials are exploratory studies designed to identify what diseases
and uses, if any, are best suited for our product candidates. It is likely that our product
candidates will not demonstrate the requisite efficacy and/or safety profile to support continued
development for most of the indications that are being, or are planned to be, studied. In fact,
our product candidates may not demonstrate the requisite efficacy and safety profile to support the
continued development for any of the indications or uses.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates before we can obtain regulatory
approval to market and sell them. We need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and human
clinical trials. Conducting these trials is a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process. These
tests and trials may not achieve favorable results for many reasons, including, among others,
failure of the product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy, the development of serious or
life-threatening adverse events (or side effects) caused by or connected with exposure to the
product candidate, difficulty in enrolling and maintaining subjects in the clinical trial, lack of
sufficient supplies of the product candidate or comparator drug, and the failure of clinical
investigators, trial monitors and other consultants, or trial subjects to comply with the trial
plan or protocol. A clinical trial may fail because it did not include a sufficient number of
patients to detect the endpoint being measured or reach statistical significance. A clinical trial
may also fail because the dose(s) of the investigational drug included in the trial were either too
low or too high to determine the optimal effect of the investigational drug in the disease setting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need to reevaluate any drug candidate that does not test favorably and either conduct
new trials, which are expensive and time consuming, or abandon the drug development program. Even
if we obtain positive results from preclinical or clinical trials, we may not achieve the same
success in future trials. Many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including us, have
suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after promising results have been obtained
in earlier trials. The failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the
desired indication(s) could harm the development of our product candidate(s), and our business,
financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes in their health, including
illnesses, injuries, and discomforts, to their study doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine
whether or not the drug candidate being studied caused these conditions. Various illnesses,
injuries, and discomforts have been reported from time-to-time during clinical trials of our
product candidates. It is possible as we test our drug candidates in larger, longer, and more
extensive clinical programs, illnesses, injuries, and discomforts that were observed in earlier
trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in smaller previous trials,
will be reported by patients. Many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational
drugs are tested in large scale, Phase 3 clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are made
available to patients after approval. If additional clinical experience indicates that any of our
product candidates has many side effects or causes serious or life-threatening side effects, the
development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed, which would severely harm our
business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our aflibercept (VEGF Trap) is being studied for the potential treatment of certain types of
cancer and our VEGF Trap-Eye candidate is being studied in diseases of the eye. There are many
potential safety concerns associated with significant blockade of vascular endothelial growth
factor, or VEGF. These serious and potentially life-threatening risks, based on the clinical and
preclinical experience of systemically delivered VEGF inhibitors, including the systemic delivery
of the VEGF Trap, include bleeding, intestinal perforation, hypertension, and proteinuria. These
serious side effects and other serious side effects have been reported in our systemic VEGF Trap
studies in cancer and diseases of the eye. In addition, patients given infusions of any protein,
including the VEGF Trap delivered through intravenous administration, may develop severe
hypersensitivity reactions or infusion reactions. Other VEGF blockers have reported side effects
that became evident only after large scale trials or after marketing approval and large number of
patients were treated. These include side effects that we have not yet seen in our trials such as
heart attack and stroke. These and other complications or side effects could harm the development
of aflibercept for the treatment of cancer or VEGF Trap-Eye for the treatment of diseases of the
eye.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have tested ARCALYST&#153; in only a small number of patients with CAPS. As more patients begin
to use our product and as we test it in new disease settings, new risks and side effects associated

determined to be significant. Like cytokine antagonists such as

the immune defense system of the body by blocking some of its functions. Therefore, ARCALYST&#153; may
interfere with the body&#146;s ability to fight infections. Treatment with Kineret<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (Amgen),
a medication that works through the inhibition of IL-1, has been associated with an increased risk
of serious infections, and serious, life threatening infections have been reported in patients
taking ARCALYST&#153;. These or other complications or side effects could cause regulatory authorities
to revoke approvals of ARCALYST&#153;. Alternatively, we may be required to conduct additional clinical
trials, make changes in the labeling of our product, or limit or abandon our efforts to develop
ARCALYST&#153; in new disease settings. These side effects may also result in a reduction, or even the
elimination, of sales of ARCALYST&#153; in approved indications.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles faced by our
product candidates, the administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an immune
response, resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein. The antibodies
can have no effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein, or require that
higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect. In some cases, the antibody can cross react
with the patient&#146;s own proteins, resulting in an &#147;auto-immune&#148; type disease. Whether antibodies
will be created can often not be predicted from preclinical or clinical experiments, and their
detection or appearance is often delayed, so that there can be no assurance that neutralizing
antibodies will not be detected at a later date, in some cases even after pivotal clinical trials
have been completed. Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected
in patients with

occasion. To date, no side effects related to antibodies were observed in these subjects and there
were no observed effects on drug efficacy or drug levels. It is possible that as we continue to

will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the
extent that our rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained
as trade secrets. The patent position of biotechnology companies involves complex legal and factual
questions and, therefore, enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. Our patents may be
challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Patent applications filed outside the United States may
be challenged by third parties who file an opposition. Such opposition proceedings are increasingly
common in the European Union and are costly to defend. We have patent applications that are being
opposed and it is likely that we will need to defend additional patent applications in the future.
Our patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary position or competitive advantages against
competitors. Furthermore, even if the outcome is favorable to us, the enforcement of our

lawsuit for patent infringement and assert that its patents are valid and cover aflibercept or VEGF
Trap-Eye. Genentech may be motivated to initiate such a lawsuit at some point in an effort to
impair our ability to develop and sell aflibercept or VEGF Trap-Eye, which represents a potential
competitive threat to Genentech&#146;s VEGF-binding products and product candidates. An adverse
determination by a court in any such potential patent litigation would likely materially harm our

manufactured for development, following approval, in commercial quantities, in compliance with
regulatory requirements, and at competitive costs. If we or any of our product collaborators or
third-party manufacturers, product packagers, or labelers are unable to maintain regulatory
compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions, including, among other things, refusal to

presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to
be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical companies have been
prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as
allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill
federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices
that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses
that the FDA has not approved, or off-label uses, that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid
for non-covered off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid
Rebate program.

these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative

the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be
subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, several states and localities, including California, the District of
Columbia, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Vermont, and West Virginia, have enacted
legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, and file
periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing,
clinical trials, and other activities. Similar legislation is being considered in other states.
Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and the penalties for failure to comply with
these requirements are unclear. Nonetheless, if we are found not to be in full compliance with
these laws, we could face enforcement action and fines and other penalties, and could receive
adverse publicity.

increased our legal costs, and significantly increased our accounting and auditing costs, and we
expect these costs to continue. These developments may make it more difficult and more expensive

effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the independent
registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements must attest to and report on
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market for eye disease products is also very competitive. Novartis and Genentech are

eye indications that was approved by the FDA in June&nbsp;2006. Many other companies are working on the
development of product candidates for the potential treatment of wet AMD that act by blocking VEGF,
VEGF receptors, and through the use of soluble ribonucleic acids (sRNAs) that modulate gene
expression. In addition, ophthalmologists are using off-label a third-party reformatted version of
Genentech&#146;s approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>, with success for the treatment of wet

The marketing approval of Lucentis<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (Genentech) and the potential off-label use of
Avastin<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (Genentech) make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in our clinical

significant experience using these effective medicines. Moreover, in such indications these

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are both small molecules and antibodies in development by other companies that are
designed to block the synthesis of interleukin-1 or inhibit the signaling of interleukin-1. For
example, Eli Lilly and Company, Xoma Ltd., and Novartis are each developing antibodies to
interleukin-1 and Amgen is developing an antibody to the interleukin-1 receptor. Novartis has
commenced advanced clinical testing of its IL-1 antibody in Muckle-Wells Syndrome, which is part of
the group of rare genetic diseases called CAPS. Novartis recently announced that its IL-1 antibody
demonstrated long-lasting clinical remission in patients with CAPS and that its clinical candidate
could develop into a major therapeutic advance in the treatment of CAPS. Novartis&#146; IL-1 antibody
and these other drug candidates could offer competitive advantages over ARCALYST&#153;. The successful
development of these competing molecules could delay or impair our ability to successfully develop

Biologics License Application with the FDA. Roche&#146;s IL-6 receptor antibody, other clinical

ARCALYST&#153;, if third party payers do not agree to reimburse the cost of ARCALYST&#153; therapy and this

products may also reduce our profitability. In the United States, there have been, and we expect
will continue to be, actions and proposals to control and reduce healthcare costs. Government and
other third-party payers are challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and
increasingly limiting, and attempting to limit, both coverage and level of reimbursement for
prescription drugs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since ARCALYST&#153; and our product candidates in clinical development, will likely be too
expensive for most patients to afford without health insurance coverage, if our products are unable
to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payers our ability to successfully
commercialize our product candidates may be adversely impacted. Any limitation on the use of our
products or any decrease in the price of our products will have a material adverse effect on our
ability to achieve profitability.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain foreign countries, pricing, coverage and level of reimbursement of prescription
drugs are subject to governmental control, and we may be unable to negotiate coverage, pricing, and
reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us. In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing
for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug
pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for
its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health
insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human
use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt
a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal
product on the market. Our results of operations may suffer if we are unable to market our products
in foreign countries or if coverage and reimbursement for our products in foreign countries is
limited.

employment agreement that provides severance benefits in the event our officers are terminated as a
result of a change in control of the Company. Many of our stock options issued under our 2000
Long-Term Incentive Plan may become fully vested in connection with a &#147;change in control&#148; of our
company, as defined in the plan.
