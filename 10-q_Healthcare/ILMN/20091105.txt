ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.  29        Our business is subject to various risks, including those described in Item 1A of our (i) Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 28, 2009 and (ii) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008, which we strongly encourage you to review. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our (i) Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 28, 2009 and (ii) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008.  Our products, if used for the diagnosis of disease, could be subject to government regulation, and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may be expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain.   Our products are not currently subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease. However, as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease, certain of our products are likely to become subject to regulation by the FDA, or comparable agencies of other countries, including requirements for regulatory approval of such products before they can be marketed. Such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain, and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. In addition, changes to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional regulations, could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products, which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain FDA or comparable regulatory approval of our products, if required.   Molecular diagnostic products, in particular, depending on their intended use, may be regulated as medical devices by FDA and comparable agencies of other countries and may require either receiving clearance from the FDA following a pre-market notification process or premarket approval from the FDA, in each case prior to marketing. Obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay. If we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop, we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner, or at all.   In addition, the regulatory approval or clearance process required to manufacture, market, and sell our existing and future products that are intended for, and marketed and labeled as, “Research Use Only,” or RUO, is uncertain if such products are used or could be used, even without our consent, for the diagnosis of disease. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our RUO products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  We depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for components and materials used in our products. If shipments from these manufacturers or suppliers are delayed or interrupted, or if the quality of the components or materials supplied do not meet our requirements, we may not be able to launch, manufacture, or ship our products in a timely manner, or at all.   The nature of our products requires customized components and materials that currently are available from a limited number of sources, and, in the case of some components and materials, from only a single source. If deliveries from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason, or if we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply, we may not be able to obtain these components or materials timely or in sufficient quantities or qualities in order to meet demand for our products. We may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercial-scale production of some of our products, or develop these capabilities internally, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely basis, for sufficient quantities, or on commercially reasonable terms. Accordingly, we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable, high-volume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs. In addition, the manufacture or shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the quality of the components or materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our requirements. Any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
