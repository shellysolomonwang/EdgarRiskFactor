Item 1A. Risk Factors” below as well as those discussed elsewhere. Accordingly, you should not unduly rely on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. We undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events after the date of this Quarterly Report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should, however, review the factors and risks we describe in the reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Overview   We are a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function. We provide a comprehensive line of proprietary products and services that currently serve the sequencing, genotyping and gene expression markets. In the future, we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics. Our customers include leading genomic research centers, pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, clinical research organizations, biotechnology companies and agricultural companies. Our tools provide researchers around the world with the performance, throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to perform the billions of genetic tests needed to extract valuable biological information through advances in genomics and proteomics. We believe this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological function, which will enhance drug discovery and clinical research, allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for individual patients.   We sell the Genome Analyzer and related reagent into the sequencing market. This instrument uses reagents based on our proprietary sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) biochemistry. The system has several advantages over prior sequencing technologies. In particular, the system is capable of generating several billion bases of DNA sequence from a single run with a single sample preparation. This dramatically reduces the cost of sequencing relative to conventional technologies, making sequencing at a genome wide scale practical.   Our BeadArray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform millions of assays simultaneously, enabling large-scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function in a unique high-throughput, cost effective, and flexible manner. We sell two primary families of products based on this technology, the GoldenGate genotyping products and the Infinium product family. Both products can be read on our proprietary scanner, the iScan system. These products are used primarily in the genotyping market and have several advantages over competitors including, more flexible content and an easier workflow due to the multi-sample characteristics of the products.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   Except as set forth below, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the six months ended June 28, 2009. For further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008, which we filed with the SEC on February 26, 2009.  Convertible Senior Notes   We account for our Convertible Senior Notes in accordance with FASB Staff Position (FSP) Accounting Principles Board Opinions (APB) 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that May be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1 or the FSP). We adopted this FSP on December 29, 2008. It significantly impacts the accounting for our Convertible Senior Notes by requiring us to account separately for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt. The liability component is measured so the effective interest expense associated with the convertible debt reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate at the date of issuance for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature. The difference between the cash proceeds associated with the convertible debt and this estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the convertible debt.   Determining the fair value of the liability component requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the liability component and, in  18    Table of Contents  effect, the associated interest expense. According to the guidance, the carrying amount of the liability component is determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component. If no similar liabilities exist, estimates of fair value are primarily determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the liability component, including market interest rates, credit standing, yield curves and volatilities.

The three and six months ended June 28, 2009 and June 29, 2008 were both 13 and 26 weeks, respectively.  Three months Ended June 28, 2009 and June 29, 2008  Revenue                                      Three Months Ended               June 28,     June 29,     Percentage         2009     2008     Change         (in thousands)               Product revenue   $ 153,204     $ 128,552       19 %   Service and other revenue     8,439       11,625       (27 )                           Total revenue   $ 161,643     $ 140,177       15 %                              Revenue increased $21.5 million due to growth in our product revenue. Product revenue consists of revenue primarily from the sale of consumables and instruments.   Revenue from the sale of consumables increased to $96.5 million for the three months ended June 28, 2009 compared to $81.7 million for the three months ended June 29, 2008. The year over year increase was due to an increase of $18.5 million in sequencing consumables which was partially offset by a decrease of $3.7 million in microarray consumables. Growth in our sequencing consumables was mostly driven by growth in the installed base of our Genome Analyzer and the progression of customer labs ramping to production scale. The decrease in microarray consumables was primarily attributable to customers delaying the start of new Genome Wide Association Studies in anticipation of new, rare variant content arrays, order delays directly related to stimulus funding under the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act and the impact of reduced foundation funding at a few key customers.   Revenue from the sale of instruments increased to $53.8 million for the three months ended June 28, 2009 compared to $43.2 million for the three months ended June 29, 2008. The year over year increase was primarily driven by the strong demand for our  19    Table of Contents  Genome Analyzer systems. Both average selling prices and units sold were higher during the second quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of 2008. The increase in average selling prices was attributable to two factors: (i) lower average selling prices in the second quarter of 2008 related to a product transition from the Genome Analyzer I to the Genome Analyzer II; and (ii) technological improvements leading to the launch of the Genome Analyzer IIx during the second quarter of 2009.  Cost of Product and Service and Other Revenue                                      Three Months Ended               June 28,     June 29,     Percentage         2009     2008     Change         (in thousands)               Cost of product revenue   $ 45,812     $ 47,148       (3 %)   Cost of service and other revenue     3,003       3,311       (9 )                           Total cost of revenue   $ 48,815     $ 50,459       (3 %)                              Cost of revenue, which excludes the impairment of manufacturing equipment and the amortization of intangible assets, decreased $1.6 million despite higher sales, primarily due to a decrease in manufacturing costs and improved overhead absorption.   Cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue was 30% for the three months ended June 28, 2009, compared to 38% for the three months ended June 29, 2008. The decrease is primarily due to lower costs for our sequencing consumables and instrumentation. The cost of sequencing consumables decreased as a percentage of related revenue due to improved overhead absorption from increased volumes and the benefit of decreased costs associated with the reformulation of our sequencing kits launched at the end of the third quarter of 2008. The cost of sequencing instruments decreased as a percentage of related revenue due to production efficiencies and reduced material costs coupled with higher average selling prices.  Operating Expenses                                      Three Months Ended               June 28,     June 29,     Percentage         2009     2008     Change         (in thousands)               Research and development   $ 33,117     $ 23,493       41 %   Selling, general and administrative     41,939       35,616       18                             Total operating expenses   $ 75,056     $ 59,109       27 %                              The increase in research and development expenses of $9.6 million was driven primarily by a $3.8 million increase in spending on our sequencing technologies, a $3.0 million increase in spending on our BeadArray technologies and a $1.5 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The increases in both sequencing and BeadArray were primarily due to an overall increase in personnel-related expenses related to increased headcount, including salaries and benefits and increased lab and material expenses. Additionally, during the three months ended June 28, 2009, we recorded $0.9 million in accrued compensation expense associated with contingent consideration for the Avantome acquisition completed on August 1, 2008.   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $6.3 million driven primarily by an increase of $6.3 million in personnel-related expenses, including salaries, non-cash stock-based compensation and benefits and an increase of $1.3 million in other non-personnel expenses associated with the growth of our business. These increases were offset by a decrease of $1.3 million in outside services particularly associated with a reduction in our outside legal fees.  Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net                                      Three Months Ended           June 28,   June 29,   Percentage       2009   2008   Change       (in thousands)             Interest and other income (expense), net   $ (1,079 )   $ (3,682 )     (71 %)      Interest and other expense decreased $2.6 million primarily due to an increase of $2.7 million in net foreign currency transaction gains due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates coupled with a change in our foreign entity functional currency designation from the local currency to the U.S. dollar beginning the third quarter of 2008. During the second quarter of 2009, interest income increased by $0.5 million due to an increase in investments. These increases were partially offset by a loss from our derivative foreign exchange contracts of $0.5 million and additional interest expense of $0.2 million due to the accretion of our debt balance resulting from the adoption and retrospective application of FSP APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt, in the first quarter of 2009.  20    Table of Contents  Provision for Income Taxes                                      Three Months Ended           June 28,   June 29,   Percentage       2009   2008   Change       (in thousands)             Provision for income taxes   $ 10,335     $ 7,530       37 %      The provision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income tax expenses. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in the income before income taxes, partially offset by a change in the proportion of income earned in lower tax jurisdictions.   As of December 28, 2008, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $87.7 million and $148.3 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2025 and 2013, respectively, unless previously utilized. In addition, we also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $12.6 million and $13.9 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2018 and 2019, respectively, unless previously utilized.   Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in our ownership structure. These annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization. Previous limitations due to Section 382 and 383 have been reflected in the deferred tax assets as of June 28, 2009.   Based upon the available evidence as of June 28, 2009, we are not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $2.8 million and $9.1 million against certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively.   As of June 28, 2009, no material changes have been made to our uncertain tax positions recorded in accordance with FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.  Six months Ended June 28, 2009 and June 29, 2008  Revenue                                      Six Months Ended               June 28,     June 29,     Percentage         2009     2008     Change         (in thousands)               Product revenue   $ 309,403     $ 239,235       29 %   Service and other revenue     17,997       22,803       (21 )                           Total revenue   $ 327,400     $ 262,038       25 %                              Revenue increased by $65.4 million due to growth in our product revenue. Product revenue consists of revenue primarily from the sale of consumables and instruments.   Revenue from the sale of consumables increased to $199.7 million for the six months ended June 28, 2009 compared to $144.9 million for the six months ended June 29, 2008. The increase was due to an increase of $35.8 million in sequencing consumables and $19.0 million in microarray consumables. Growth in our sequencing consumables was primarily driven by growth in the installed base of our Genome Analyzer and the progression of customer labs ramping to production scale. The increase in revenue associated with our microarray consumables can mainly be attributed to the transition from our Infinium II to our Infinium HD BeadChips. This transition resulted in a decrease in unit volume sales of BeadChips offset by an increase in average selling prices per BeadChip due to the evolution of our products to put more samples on one chip.   Revenue from the sale of instruments increased to $104.3 million for the six months ended June 28, 2009 compared to $87.7 million for the six months ended June 29, 2008. The year over year increase was primarily driven by the strong demand for our Genome Analyzer systems. Both average selling prices and units sold were higher during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in average selling prices was attributable to two factors: (i) lower average selling prices in the second quarter of 2008 related to a product transition from the Genome Analyzer I to the Genome Analyzer II; and (ii) technological improvements leading to the launch of the Genome Analyzer IIx during the second quarter of 2009.  21    Table of Contents  Cost of Product and Service and Other Revenue                                      Six Months Ended               June 28,     June 29,     Percentage         2009     2008     Change         (in thousands)               Cost of product revenue   $ 96,519     $ 89,673       8 %   Cost of service and other revenue     6,318       6,867       (8 )                           Total cost of revenue   $ 102,837     $ 96,540       7 %                              Cost of revenue, which excludes the impairment of manufacturing equipment and the amortization of intangible assets, decreased $6.3 million despite higher sales, primarily due to a decrease in manufacturing costs and improved overhead absorption.   Cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue was 32% for the six months ended June 28, 2009, compared to 39% for the six months ended June 29, 2008. The decrease is primarily due to lower costs for our sequencing consumables and instrumentation. The cost of sequencing consumables decreased as a percentage of related revenue due to improved overhead absorption from increased volumes and the benefit of decreased costs associated with the reformulation of our sequencing kits launched at the end of the third quarter of 2008. The cost of sequencing instruments decreased as a percentage of related revenue due to production efficiencies and reduced material costs coupled with higher average selling prices. The sales of our High-Density Infinium BeadChips launched in the first quarter of 2009 also contributed to the decrease as a percentage of related sales due to higher average selling prices as compared to the Infinium BeadChips sold in the first quarter of 2008.  Operating Expenses                                      Six Months Ended               June 28,     June 29,     Percentage         2009     2008     Change         (in thousands)               Research and development   $ 65,843     $ 44,057       49 %   Selling, general and administrative     84,770       69,443       22                             Total operating expenses   $ 150,613     $ 113,500       33 %                              The increase in research and development expenses of $21.8 million was driven primarily by a $7.8 million increase in spending on our sequencing technologies, a $6.6 million increase in spending on our BeadArray technologies and a $2.8 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The increases in both sequencing and BeadArray were primarily due to an overall increase in personnel-related expenses due to the growth of the business, including salaries and benefits and increased lab and material expenses. Additionally, during the six months ended June 28, 2009, we incurred a $2.0 million expense to obtain exclusive licensing rights to certain new technologies under development and recorded $1.8 million in accrued compensation expense associated with contingent consideration for the Avantome acquisition completed on August 1, 2008.   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $15.3 million driven primarily by an increase of $13.8 million in personnel-related expenses, including salaries, non-cash stock-based compensation and benefits, as well as an increase of $2.2 million in non-personnel related expenses associated with the growth of our business. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in outside services due mostly to a decline in consulting fees.  Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net                                      Six Months Ended           June 28,   June 29,   Percentage       2009   2008   Change       (in thousands)             Interest and other income (expense), net   $ (6,236 )   $ (4,525 )     38 %      Interest and other expense, net increased $1.7 million primarily due to an increase of $1.8 million in net foreign currency transaction losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, a change in our foreign entity functional currency designation from the local currency to the U.S. dollar beginning the third quarter of 2008 and losses derived from our derivative foreign exchange contracts. Additionally, interest expense increased by $0.5 million due to the accretion of our debt balance resulting from the adoption and retrospective application of FSP APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt, in the first quarter of 2009. Interest income decreased by $0.3 million due to a change in our cash and investment portfolio to a mix of shorter duration maturities and an increased number of agency-rated investments coupled with an overall decline in interest rates due to current market conditions. These increases to interest and other expense, net were partially offset by a gain of $0.8 million on the extinguishment of debt during the first quarter of 2009.  22    Table of Contents  Provision for Income Taxes                                      Six Months Ended           June 28,   June 29,   Percentage       2009   2008   Change       (in thousands)             Provision for income taxes   $ 20,875     $ 14,919       40 %      The provision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income tax expenses.

Forward-Looking Information   Strong demand for next generation sequencing applications continues to drive both sequencing instrument and consumable sales. We believe that as the cost of next generation sequencing declines, the number of samples available for sequencing will significantly increase. In addition, we expect the corresponding data generated using next-generation sequencers will help provide the content to produce new microarrays going forward. We believe this relationship between sequencing products and microarrays will enable growth in both product lines. We expect changes in our product mix to continue to affect our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue. Additionally, we expect price competition to continue in our market, and our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter as a result.   We also expect to incur additional operating costs to support the expected growth in our business. We believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into additional markets. Accordingly, we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our product base. Selling, general and administrative expenses are also expected to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our staff and add sales and marketing infrastructure.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cashflow (in thousands)                              Six months Ended         June 28, 2009     June 29, 2008       Net cash provided by operating activities   $ 90,117     $ 10,468     Net cash used in investing activities     (113,128 )     (81,507 )   Net cash provided by financing activities     46,946       30,150     Effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents     1,138       (1,084 )                   Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents   $ 25,073     $ (41,973 )                     23    Table of Contents   Historically, our sources of cash have included:       •   issuance of equity and debt securities, including cash generated from the issuance of our convertible notes in February 2007, our public offering of common stock in August 2008 and the exercise of stock options and participation in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP);        •   cash generated from operations; and        •   interest income.        Our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with:        •   cash used for operating activities, such as the purchase and growth of inventory, expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development infrastructure and other working capital needs;        •   cash paid for litigation settlements;        •   cash used for our stock repurchases;        •   expenditures related to increasing our manufacturing capacity and improving our manufacturing efficiency;        •   cash paid for acquisitions and investments;        •   cash paid for the conversion of a portion of our senior convertible notes; and        •   interest payments on the outstanding senior convertible notes.        Other factors that impact our cash inflow and outflow include:        •   increases in our product and services revenue. As our product sales have increased significantly since 2001, operating income has increased significantly as well, providing us with an increased source of cash to finance the expansion of our operations; and        •   fluctuations in our working capital.     As of June 28, 2009, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $790.3 million, compared to $696.0 million as of December 28, 2008. Included in the investment balance as of June 28, 2009 were auction rate securities of $55.8 million issued primarily by municipalities and universities. At December 28, 2008, the fair value of the Company’s auction rate securities was $47.2 million. During the six months ended June 28, 2009, the Company recorded a gain of $2.6 million, resulting in an increase to the fair value of the Company’s auction rate securities to $49.7 million at June 28, 2009. We based our fair value determination on estimated discounted future cash flows of interest income over a projected period reflective of the length of time we anticipate it will take the securities to become liquid. Additionally, we classified these securities as long-term investments as of June 28, 2009, as we believe we may not be able to liquidate our investments within the next year.   In November 2008, we signed a settlement agreement allowing us to sell our auction rate securities at par value to UBS at our discretion during the period of June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. To account for this settlement, we recorded a put option at fair value, which approximates the difference between the par value and fair value of the auction rate securities. Gains and losses associated with the put option are recognized in earnings approximately equal to changes in the fair value of the auction rate securities at each balance sheet date. As of June 28, 2009, the fair value of the put option totaled $6.1 million.   The primary inflow of cash during the six months ended June 28, 2009 was approximately $266.2 million from the sale and maturity of our investments in available-for-sale securities, $90.1 million from operating activities and approximately $24.1 million from the exercise of our stock options. The primary cash outflows during the six months ended June 28, 2009 were attributable to the purchase of available-for-sale securities for approximately $334.8 million.   In January 2009, we executed a strategic alliance with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), which consists of a commercialization agreement and equity investment. The cash outflow of $18.0 million was in exchange for the equity investment. Further, we have agreed to make an additional equity investment upon the achievement of a specific technical milestone.  24    Table of Contents   Our primary short-term needs for capital, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to:       •   our facilities expansion needs, including costs of leasing additional facilities;        •   the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development facilities;        •   support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products, including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources both in the United States and abroad;        •   potential strategic acquisitions and investments;        •   the continued advancement of research and development efforts; and        •   improvements in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency.     We expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating income, as well as the status of each of our new product development programs, will significantly impact our cash management decisions.   Our outstanding senior convertible notes (the Notes) were convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock for the period from April 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008 and became convertible again beginning April 1, 2009 and will continue to be convertible at least through, and including, September 30, 2009. On December 29, 2008, a Noteholder converted Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. On February 4, 2009, the settlement date, we paid the Noteholder the conversion value of the Notes in cash, up to the principal amount of the Notes. The excess of the conversion value over the principal amount, totaling $2.9 million, was paid in shares of common stock. This equity dilution upon conversion of the Notes was offset by the reacquisition of the shares under the convertible note hedge transactions (the Hedge) entered into in connection with the offering of the Notes. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the terms of the Notes.   We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next 12 months, barring unforeseen circumstances. Operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. At the present time, we have no material commitments for capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including:       •   our ability to successfully evolve our technologies and create innovative products in our markets;        •   scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs;        •   competing technological and market developments; and        •   the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings.     As a result of the factors listed above, we may require additional funding in the future. In the event additional funding needs arise, we may obtain cash through new debt or stock issuance, or a combination of sources.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.     Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the reported market risks disclosed in that section of our Form 10-K.  25    Table of Contents  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk   Many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entity’s U.S. functional currency. These transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency. The value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash. Our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the Euro, Yen, British pound sterling, Australian dollar and Singapore dollar. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income. We recognized a net currency exchange gain on business transactions, net of hedging transactions, of $2.0 million for the three months ended June 28, 2009 and a net currency exchange loss on business transactions, net of hedging transactions, of $1.2 million for the six months ended June 28, 2009, which are included in interest and other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   During the second quarter of 2009, we began using forward exchange contracts to manage a portion of the foreign currency exposure risk for foreign subsidiaries with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency. We only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks; we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures, and they generally have terms of one year or less. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income, as they have not been designated for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging Activities. These contracts, which settle monthly, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled, so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities. At June 28, 2009, we had $0.1 million in foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge foreign currency risk.             Item 4.   Controls and Procedures.     We design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that (1) our transactions are properly authorized; (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly recorded and reported in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also maintain internal controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and our established financial policies.   We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act), as of June 28, 2009. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of June 28, 2009, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.   An evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the second quarter of 2009 and that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. That evaluation did not identify any such change.     PART II — OTHER INFORMATION             Item 1.   Legal Proceedings.     From time to time, the Company is party to litigation in the ordinary course of business. While management does not believe that our pending legal matters will have a material adverse impact on us, the results of any litigation are typically uncertain.  26    Table of Contents             ITEM 1A.   Risk Factors.     Our business is subject to various risks, including those described in Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008, which we filed with the SEC on February 26, 2009 and strongly encourage you to review. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in that section of our Form 10-K.  The timing and extent of funding provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act) could have a material negative impact on our results of operations.   The Recovery Act was enacted in February 2009 to provide stimulus to the U.S. economy in the wake of the economic downturn. As part of the Recovery Act legislation, over $10 billion in funding was provided to the National Institute of Health through September 2010 to support the advancement of scientific research. A portion of the stimulus funding may support the analysis of genetic variation and biological function and have a significant positive impact on our business. In the short-term, however, our customers may delay or reduce their purchases of our products as they wait to learn whether, and to what extent, they will receive stimulus funding. Additionally, if our customers are unable to obtain stimulus money they may reduce their research and development budgets resulting in a decrease in demand for our products. A decline in demand will reduce our revenues and harm our profitability.             Item 2.   Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
