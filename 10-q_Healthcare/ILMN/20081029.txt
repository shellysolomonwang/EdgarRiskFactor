Item 1A. Risk Factors” below as well as those discussed elsewhere. Accordingly, you should not unduly rely on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. We undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events after the date of this Quarterly Report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should, however, review the factors and risks we describe in the reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Overview   We are a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function. Using our proprietary technologies, we provide a comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve the sequencing, genotyping and gene expression markets. In the future, we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics. Our customers include leading genomic research centers, pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, clinical research organizations and biotechnology companies. Our tools provide researchers around the world with the performance, throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to perform the billions of genetic tests needed to extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics and proteomics. We believe this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological function, which will enhance drug discovery and clinical research, allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for individual patients.  Our Technologies  BeadArray Technology   We have developed a proprietary array technology that enables the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function. Our BeadArray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously. Our BeadArray technology provides a unique combination of high throughput, cost effectiveness, and flexibility. We believe that these features have enabled our BeadArray technology to become a leading platform for the emerging high-growth market of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and expect they will enable us to become a key player in the gene expression market.  18    Table of Contents  Sequencing Technology   Our DNA sequencing technology, acquired as part of the Solexa merger that was completed on January 26, 2007, is based on the use of our proprietary sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) biochemistry. Our technology is capable of generating several billion bases of DNA sequence from a single experiment with a single sample preparation, dramatically reducing the cost and improving the practicality, of human resequencing compared to conventional technologies.  VeraCode Technology   The VeraCode technology, acquired as part of the acquisition of CyVera Corporation in April 2005, enables cost-effective, high-throughput analysis of DNA, RNA and proteins at mid- to low- multiplex range. Multiplexing refers to the number of individual pieces of information that are simultaneously extracted from one sample. In addition to Life Science research applications, we believe the molecular diagnostics market will require systems that are extremely high throughput and cost effective in this mid- to low-multiplex range. We began shipping the BeadXpress System, which uses the VeraCode technology, for Life Science research applications during the first quarter of 2007, along with several assays for the system. In the research market, we expect our customers to utilize our BeadArray technology for their higher multiplex projects and then move to our BeadXpress system for their lower multiplex projects utilizing the same assays.  Product Developments   Consumables   During the nine months ended September 28, 2008, we introduced two new products for DNA analysis: the Infinium High-Density (HD) Human1M-Duo (two samples per chip) and the Human610-Quad (four samples per chip), featuring up to 2.3 million SNPs per BeadChip. The new Infinium HD product line doubles sample throughput compared to prior generations of the product and reduces DNA input requirements by as much as seventy percent. First customer shipments of the Human610-Quad occurred in the first quarter of 2008. The Human1M-Duo BeadChips began shipment in the second quarter of 2008.   Additionally, in April 2008, we introduced a new product for RNA analysis: the HumanHT—12 Gene Expression BeadChip which enables researchers to perform whole genome gene expression on twelve samples in parallel. Shipment of this product began during the second quarter of 2008.   Instruments   During the first quarter of 2008, we launched the next-generation Genome Analyzer, the Genome Analyzer II (GAII) DNA Sequencing platform. We believe the GAII significantly improves the overall robustness and throughput of the Genome Analyzer and enables researchers to achieve industry leading accuracy and daily throughput at the lowest operating cost. Shipments began during the first quarter of 2008.   In April 2008, we launched the iScan System, a next-generation BeadChip scanner that, we believe, provides researchers conducting genotyping and gene expression studies with significantly greater throughput, enhanced automation, and improved ease of use. When used with the Human1M-Duo or the Human610-Quad and our Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and automation options, the iScan System can complete genotyping studies up to six times faster than studies run on our BeadStation. Under an Early Access Program, we began shipping the iScan System in the first quarter of 2008 to customers in both the academic and industrial sectors. However, broad commercial shipment of the iScan System did not commence until the second quarter of 2008.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  General   Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of financial statements requires that management make estimates, assumptions and judgments with respect to the  19    Table of Contents  application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting policies are deemed critical if 1) they require an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, or different estimates that we reasonably could have used would have a material effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.   Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  Revenue Recognition   Our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services. Product revenue consists of sales of arrays, reagents, flow cells, instrumentation and oligonucleotides (oligos). Service and other revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping and sequencing services, extended warranty sales and amounts earned under research agreements with government grants, which are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred.   We recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines established by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. Under SAB No. 104, revenue cannot be recorded until all of the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. All revenue is recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns or discounts.   Revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer, provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of instrumentation is recognized when earned, which is generally upon shipment. Revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned, which is generally at the time the genotyping and sequencing analysis data is delivered to the customer.   In order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable, we ensure there are no refund rights. If payment terms are based on future performance or a right of return exists, we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed and determinable. We assess collectibility based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured, revenue recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment. Changes in judgments and estimates regarding application of SAB No. 104 might result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized.   Sales of instrumentation generally include a standard one-year warranty. We also sell separately priced maintenance (extended warranty) contracts, which are generally for one or two years, upon the expiration of the initial warranty. Revenue for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of the extended warranty period. Reserves are provided for estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized. If we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our warrantied products were greater than our estimates, gross margins could be adversely affected.   While the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, we do enter into agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services, or rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements. Significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements, when to recognize revenue for each element, and the period over which revenue should be recognized. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine that the fair values of undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance.  20    Table of Contents  Investments   Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. In February 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. SFAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB FSP SFAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active. The FSP clarifies the application of FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active.   We have adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157 with respect to financial assets and liabilities only and will adopt the provisions for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities effective December 29, 2008. We have assessed the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities in an inactive market in accordance with SFAS No. 157-3.   We determine fair value of our financial assets and liabilities in accordance with SFAS No. 157 and 157-3. Fair value is defined under SFAS No. 157 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under SFAS No. 157 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:       •   Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.        •   Level 2 — Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.        •   Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.     In using this fair value hierarchy and the framework established by SFAS No. 157, management may be required to make assumptions of pricing by market participants and assumptions about risk, specifically when using unobservable inputs to determine fair value. These assumptions are judgmental in nature and may significantly affect our results of operations.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. We regularly analyze customer accounts, review the length of time receivables are outstanding and review historical loss rates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances could be required.  Inventory Valuation   We record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess, obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value. We must make assumptions about future demand, market conditions and the release of new products that will supersede old ones. We regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components, taking into account product life cycle and development plans, product expiration and quality issues, historical experience and our current inventory levels. If actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated, additional inventory adjustments could be required.  Contingencies   We are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters. Based on the information available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation with our legal counsel, we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these matters, as well as the potential ranges of probable losses. If losses are probable and reasonably estimable, we will record a liability in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies.  Goodwill and Intangible Asset Valuation   We make significant judgments in relation to the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets resulting from acquisitions and litigation settlements.  21    Table of Contents   In determining the carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets arising from acquisitions, we use the purchase method of accounting. The purchase method of accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (IPR&D). Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to at least annual impairment tests. The amounts and useful lives assigned to other acquired intangible assets impact future amortization, and the amount assigned to IPR&D is expensed immediately.   Determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets acquired as part of litigation settlements also requires the exercise of judgment. While there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets, we used the discounted cash flow method in determining the value of licensed technology associated with the settlement of our Affymetrix litigation. This method required significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis. In addition, other significant estimates were required such as residual growth rates and discount factors. The estimates we used to value and amortize intangible assets were consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and were based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages. These judgments can significantly affect our net operating results.   SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination. Determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projection and timing of future cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, determination of appropriate market comparables, and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. It is reasonably possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges. We have performed our annual test of goodwill as of May 30, 2008 noting no impairment. No indicators have arisen since management’s assessment on May 30, 2008 that would require further assessment.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, if indicators of impairment exist, we assess the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows. If impairment is indicated, we measure the future discounted cash flows associated with the use of the asset and adjust the value of the asset accordingly. Certain estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of long-lived assets. These estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the recognition of an impairment charge and the magnitude of any such change. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges.  Stock-Based Compensation   We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of these assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense resulting from new equity awards may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.  22    Table of Contents  Income Taxes   In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved. The evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence. As of September 28, 2008, we have maintained a valuation allowance only against certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that we concluded have not met the “more likely than not” threshold required under SFAS No. 109.   Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we recognize excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation to stockholders’ equity only when realized. When assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share-based compensation have been realized, we follow the with-and-without approach, excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions. Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us.   Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN No. 48 requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense.  Results of Operations   To enhance comparability, the following table sets forth our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the specified reporting periods stated as a percentage of total revenue.

The three and nine months ended September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007 were both 13 and 39 weeks, respectively.  23    Table of Contents  Revenue                                                              Three Months Ended             Nine months Ended               September 28,     September 30,     Percentage     September 28,     September 30,     Percentage         2008     2007     Change     2008     2007     Change         (in thousands)             (in thousands)               Product revenue   $ 140,319     $ 90,021       56%     $ 379,554     $ 225,583       68%     Service and other revenue     9,941       7,489       33%       32,744       28,611       14%                                                 Total revenue   $ 150,260     $ 97,510       54%     $ 412,298     $ 254,194       62%                                                    The increase in product revenue for both periods presented resulted predominantly from higher consumable sales, as well as higher sales of our GAII. Growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to significant demand for our Infinium products, specifically the Human610-Quad, which we began shipping during the first quarter of 2008, and overall growth in our installed base of instruments. We expect product revenue to continue to increase, which can be mainly attributed to the launch of several new products, sales of existing products, the growth of our installed base of instruments and the progression of customer labs ramping to production scale.   Service and other revenue increased for both periods presented. The increase in service and other revenue for the three months ended September 28, 2008 is primarily due to the completion of several iSelect custom SNP genotyping service contracts coupled with an increase in significant Infinium contracts completed using the Infinium Human610-Quad, and an overall increase in extended warranty sales. The increase for the nine months ended September 28, 2008 is primarily due to the increase in extended warranty sales. In addition, several iSelect custom SNP genotyping service contracts were completed and a significant number of Infinium contracts completed using the Infinium 1M during the nine months ended September 28, 2008. As product sales increase, we expect to see continued increases in the sale of our extended warranty contracts. We also expect sales from SNP genotyping service contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis, depending on the mix, the number of contracts completed and the success of our certified service providers. The timing of completion of SNP genotyping service contracts is highly dependent on the customers’ schedules for delivering the SNPs and samples to us.

The increase in cost of product revenue for both periods presented was primarily driven by higher consumable and instrument sales, including increased sales of our GAII. Included as part of cost of product revenue are charges to increase the inventory reserve of $3.5 million and $5.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 28 2008 compared to $0.1 million and $1.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007. The increase in the inventory reserve is primarily associated with product transitions. During the third quarter of 2008, we recorded additional reserves of approximately $2.7 million for product obsolescence associated with the launch of new Infinium Beadchips and the launch of a new sequencing kit that provides better performance at a substantially lower cost. Additionally, included as part of cost of product revenue is non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2008 and $1.1 million and $2.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007.   Cost of service and other revenue increased for both periods presented primarily due to higher service revenue. Included as part of cost of service and other revenue is non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2008 as compared $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007.  24    Table of Contents  Research and Development                                                              Three Months Ended           Nine months Ended           September 28,   September 30,   Percentage   September 28,   September 30,   Percentage       2008   2007   Change   2008   2007   Change       (in thousands)           (in thousands)             Research and development   $ 27,567     $ 19,753       40 %   $ 71,625     $ 53,893       33 %      Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. We expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred.   Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 18% and 17%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2008, from 20% and 21%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007. However, there was an overall increase in research and development expenditures compared to the prior year. Costs to support our BeadArray technology research activities increased approximately $4.7 million and $10.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2008 compared to the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2007, primarily due to an overall increase in personnel-related expenses, increased lab and material expenses associated with the establishment of our manufacturing facility in Singapore and the development of new products. The continued development of our Sequencing technology resulted in increased research and development expenditures of approximately $2.2 million and $5.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2008 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007. In addition, non-cash stock-based compensation expense increased by approximately $0.9 million and $3.3 million, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007. Accrued compensation expense of $0.6 million associated with contingent consideration for the Avantome acquisition completed on August 1, 2008 also contributed to the increase in research and development activities for three and nine months ended September 28, 2008. Costs to develop our newly created Diagnostics Business Unit totaled $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The increases were partially offset by a $0.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively, decrease in research and development expenses related to the VeraCode technology, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007. We began shipping our BeadXpress System, which is based on our VeraCode technology, during the first quarter of 2007. As a result of completing the development of this product, the related research and development expenses have decreased.   We believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into additional markets. Accordingly, we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our product base.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26% for both the three and nine months ended September 28, 2008, compared to 25% and 28%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2008 included stock-based compensation expenses totaling $8.0 million and $21.6 million, respectively, compared to $4.9 million and $14.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007.   Sales and marketing expenses increased by $10.5 million for the three months ended September 28, 2008 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2007. The increase is primarily due to increases of $9.1 million attributable to personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and commissions to support the growth of our business, $1.0 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and $0.3 million attributable to other non-personnel-related expenses consisting mainly of outside services associated with sales and marketing activities for our existing and new products. Included as part of these personnel-related expenses is employee travel expenses of $1.3 million due to increased headcount and continued international expansion. General and administrative expense increased by $4.6 million during the three months ended September 28, 2008, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2007. This increase was due to increases of $2.0 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $2.8 million in personnel-related expenses associated with the growth of our business. These increases were slightly offset by decreases of $0.2 million in litigation due to the settlement of our lawsuit with Affymetrix during the first quarter of 2008.  25    Table of Contents   Sales and marketing expenses increased $28.4 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2008, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2007. The increase is primarily due to increases of $23.6 million attributable to personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and commissions, to support the growth of our business. Included as part of these personnel- related expenses is employee travel expenses of $4.1 million due to increased headcount and continued international expansion. The remaining $4.8 million increase is attributed to non-personnel-related costs of $2.6 million consisting mainly of sales and marketing activities for our existing and new products and $2.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. General and administrative expense increased $9.2 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2008, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2007, due to increases of $7.3 million in personnel-related expenses associated with the growth of our business, $5.4 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $0.2 million in outside consulting services offset by a decrease of $3.7 million in legal costs primarily related to the settlement of the Affymetrix litigation during the first quarter of 2008.   We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our staff, add sales and marketing infrastructure and incur additional costs to support the growth in our business.

The increase in amortization expense is primarily due to the settlement of our lawsuit with Affymetrix on January 9, 2008 resulting in the recording of an intangible asset of $36.0 million. We began amortizing this asset during the first quarter of 2008, causing an increase in amortization of intangible assets of $2.0 million and $5.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2008 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007. The additional increase of $0.2 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2008 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2007 represents an additional month of amortization associated with the assets acquired from Solexa due to the timing of the acquisition in 2007.

The decrease in interest income over the prior period was primarily driven by a change in our cash and investment portfolio to a mix of shorter duration maturities and an increased number of agency-rated investments coupled with an overall decline in interest rates due to current market conditions.   Interest expense related to our convertible debt was $1.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2008 and $1.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007.   In addition, we recorded approximately $0.2 million and $0.9 million in net foreign currency transaction gains for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2008, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2007, net foreign currency transaction gains of $0.7 million were recorded. Net foreign transaction gains recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2007 were immaterial. The gains resulting from our net foreign currency transactions for the nine months ended September 28, 2008 are due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates coupled with a change in our foreign entity functional currency designation from the local currency to the U.S. dollar beginning the third quarter of 2008. As a result of this change, we remeasured our foreign subsidiaries’ nonmonetary assets and liabilities and related income and expense accounts to the U.S. dollar and recorded the resulting net gain as income for the quarter. Previously, under local functional currency designation, the effects of translation were recorded within stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income (loss).  Provision for Income Taxes                                                              Three Months Ended           Nine months Ended           September 28,   September 30,   Percentage   September 28,   September 30,   Percentage       2008   2007   Change   2008   2007   Change       (in thousands)           (in thousands)             Provision for income taxes   $ 11,270     $ 5,185       117 %   $ 29,699     $ 14,912       99 %      The provision for income taxes consists of federal, state, and foreign income tax expenses. The increase in the provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2008 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 was primarily driven by the increase in the income (loss) before income taxes and the expiration of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit.   As of December 30, 2007, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $29.2 million and $97.0 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2025 and 2014, respectively, unless previously utilized. In addition, we also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $9.4 million and $9.9 million respectively, which begin to expire in 2018 and 2019, respectively, unless previously utilized.   Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in our ownership structure. These annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization. Previous limitations due to Section 382 and 383 have been reflected in the deferred tax assets as of September 28, 2008.   Based upon the available evidence as of September 28, 2008, we are not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $2.8 million and $25.0 million against certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively.   As of September 28, 2008, no material changes have been made to our uncertain tax positions recorded in 2007 in accordance with FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.

Our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with:       •   cash used for operating activities such as the purchase and growth of inventory, expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development infrastructure and other working capital needs;        •   cash used for our stock repurchases;        •   expenditures related to increasing our manufacturing capacity and improving our manufacturing efficiency;        •   cash paid for litigation settlements;        •   cash paid for acquisitions; and        •   interest payments on our debt obligations;     Other factors that impact our cash inflow and outflow include:       •   significant increases in our product and services revenue. As our product sales have increased significantly since 2001, operating income has increased significantly as well, providing us with an increased source of cash to finance the expansion of our operations; and        •   fluctuations in our working capital;     As of September 28, 2008, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $649.6 million, compared to $386.1 million as of December 30, 2007. We currently invest our funds in treasury notes, commercial paper, auction rate securities, corporate bonds and U.S. dollar-based short maturity mutual funds. We do not hold securities backed by mortgages. As of September 28, 2008, we had $55.9 million in auction rate securities issued primarily by municipalities and universities, which are classified as long-term investments. During the nine months ended September 28, 2008, we recorded an unrealized loss of $4.3 million due to the failure associated with the auctions of each of these securities, which limited our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value in the near term. We have determined this reduction in fair value to be temporary. This unrealized loss reduced the fair value of our auction rate securities as of September 28, 2008 to $51.6 million. This value was determined in accordance with SFAS No. 157. We used Level 3 hierarchical inputs, due to the lack of actively traded market data, including management’s assumptions of pricing by market participants and assumptions about risk. We based our fair value determination on estimated discounted future cash flows of interest income over a projected period reflective of the length of time the Company anticipates it will take the securities to become liquid. We considered any impairment on these investments to be temporary, thus any changes in fair value were recorded to other comprehensive income and there was no effect on operating income during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2008. Refer to our Risk Factor: “Negative conditions in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity of a portion of our investment portfolio” under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007.   The primary inflow of cash during the nine months ended September 28, 2008 was from the sale of 8,050,000 shares of our common stock to the public in August 2008 at a public offering price of $43.75 per share, raising net proceeds to us of approximately $342.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Additional cash inflows during this nine-month period resulted from the sale and maturity of our investments in available-for-sale securities of approximately $290.6 million and approximately $41.5 million from the exercise of our stock options.    28    Table of Contents   The primary cash outflows during the nine months ended September 28, 2008 were attributable to the purchase of available-for-sale securities for approximately $430.9 million, the one-time payment of $90.0 million made to Affymetrix in accordance with the settlement agreement and $45.1 million in capital expenditures primarily for construction-in-progress associated with the expansion of our San Diego facilities, additions to manufacturing equipment as well as the development of our manufacturing facility in Singapore. Additionally, on August 1, 2008, we completed our acquisition of Avantome, Inc. As consideration for the acquisition, we paid $25.8 million in cash, including transaction costs, and may pay up to an additional $35.0 million in contingent cash consideration based on the achievement of certain milestones.   Our primary short-term needs for capital, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to:       •   our facilities expansion needs, including costs of leasing additional facilities;        •   the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development facilities;        •   support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products, including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources both in the United States and abroad;        •   potential strategic acquisitions and investments;        •   the continued advancement of research and development efforts; and        •   improvements in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency.     We expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating income, as well as the status of each of our new product development programs, will significantly impact our cash management decisions.   Our outstanding convertible notes became convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock as of April 1, 2008 and will continue to be convertible at least through, and including, December 31, 2008. Generally, upon conversion of a note, we must pay the conversion value of the note in cash, up to the principal amount of the note. Any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount is payable in shares of our common stock.   We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next 12 months, barring unforeseen circumstances. Operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. At the present time, we have no material commitments for capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including:       •   our ability to successfully commercialize our sequencing and VeraCode technologies and to expand our SNP genotyping and sequencing services product lines;        •   scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs;        •   competing technological and market developments; and        •   the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings.     As a result of the factors listed above, we may require additional funding in the future. Our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms, when needed, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements.  29    Table of Contents     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   Interest Rate Sensitivity   Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. We attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities. We have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio, and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments. For example, if a 100 basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in 2008, our interest income would change by approximately $6.5 million in relation to amounts we would expect to earn, based on our cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investment securities as of September 28, 2008.   Market Price Sensitive Instruments   In order to potentially reduce equity dilution, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions, entitling us to purchase up to 22,902,960 shares of our common stock at a strike price of approximately $21.83 per share, subject to adjustment. In addition, we sold to these counterparties warrants (the warrants) exercisable on a cash basis, for up to 18,322,320 shares of our common stock at a strike price of $31.435 per share, subject to adjustment. The anti-dilutive effect of the bond hedge transactions, if any, could be partially or fully offset to the extent the trading price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on the exercise dates of the warrants, which occur during 2014, assuming the warrants are exercised.   Foreign Currency Exchange Risk   We have operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The functional currency for each of our subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. dollar at month-end exchange rates and remeasure the nonmonetary assets and liabilities to the U.S. dollar at historical rates. Income and expense amounts related to monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the U.S. dollar at the weighted average exchange rates in effect during the relevant period, and income and expense accounts related to nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the U.S. dollar at historical exchange rates. Remeasurement gains and losses are recognized as income, or expense, in the period of occurrence.   In addition, many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entity’s U.S. functional currency. These transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency. The value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in exchange rates. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income. The net currency exchange gain recognized on business transactions was $0.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2008 and is included in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations.     Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   We design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that (1) our transactions are properly authorized; (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly recorded and reported in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also maintain internal controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and our established financial policies.   We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act), as of September 28, 2008. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 28, 2008, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.  30    Table of Contents   An evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2008 and that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. That evaluation did not identify any such change.     PART II — OTHER INFORMATION     Item 1. Legal Proceedings.   In the recent past, we incurred substantial costs in defending ourselves against patent infringement claims and expect, going forward, to devote substantial financial and managerial resources to protect our intellectual property and to defend against any future claims asserted against us.   Applied Biosystems Litigation   On December 26, 2006, the Applied Biosystems Group of Applera Corporation (Applied Biosystems) filed suit in California Superior Court, Santa Clara County against Solexa (which we acquired on January 26, 2007). This State Court action was related to the ownership of several patents assigned in 1995 to Solexa’s predecessor company (Lynx Therapeutics) by a former employee (Dr. Stephen Macevicz), who is the inventor of these patents and is named as a co-defendant in the suit. Lynx was originally a unit of Applied Biosystems but was spun out in 1992. On May 31, 2007, Applied Biosystems filed a second suit, this time against us, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. This second suit sought a declaratory judgment of non-infringement of the Macevicz patents that are the subject of the State Court action mentioned above. Both suits were later consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division. By these consolidated actions, Applied Biosytems is seeking ownership of the Macevicz patents, unspecified costs and damages, and a declaration of non-infringement and invalidity of these patents. Applied Biosystems is not asserting any claim for patent infringement against us. The case is currently scheduled to go to trial on December 1, 2008.   The Macevicz patents relate to methods for sequencing DNA using successive rounds of oligonucleotide probe ligation (sequencing-by-ligation). Our Genome Analyzer products use a different technology called Sequencing-by-Synthesis (SBS), which we believe is not covered by any of these patents. In addition, we have no plans to use any of the Sequencing-by-Ligation technologies covered by these patents.     ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.   Our business is subject to various risks, including those described in Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007, which we filed with the SEC on February 26, 2008 and strongly encourage you to review. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in that section of our Form 10-K.   We no longer consider the risk factor in our annual report titled “The combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition as a result of our failure to achieve anticipated revenue growth following the acquisition” to be material. This risk factor, which addressed the realization of the anticipated benefits of our Solexa acquisition, is no longer considered material because we have experienced operating profits resulting from the acquisition. In addition, we no longer consider the risk factor in our annual report titled “The accounting method for our convertible debt securities may be subject to change” to be relevant, because the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. APB 14-1 in May 2008. This FSP finalized the proposed change in accounting treatment for our convertible notes. We refer you to the discussion under the heading “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to our financial statements.   In addition, we considered the following additional risk factors to be relevant to our business:   Negative conditions in global credit markets may result in delayed payments from our customers and may negatively impact our smaller suppliers.  31    Table of Contents   While overall funding for next-generation sequencing and genetic analysis research has continued to be favorable from economies around the world, the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers may be impacted by the recent economic conditions and market turbulence. Certain of our customers may face challenges gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding would be negatively impacted. Additionally, these economic conditions and market turbulence may also impact our smaller suppliers causing them to be unable to supply in a timely manner sufficient quantities of customized components, thereby impairing our ability to manufacture on schedule and at commercially reasonable costs.   Loss of the tax deduction on our outstanding convertible notes.   We could lose some or all of the tax deduction for interest expense associated with our $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in 2014 if the foregoing notes are not subject to the special Treasury Regulations governing integration of certain debt instruments (which we do not expect to be the case) the notes are converted, or we invest in non-taxable investments.
