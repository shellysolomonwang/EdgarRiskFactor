Item 1A. Risk Factors” below as well as those discussed elsewhere. Accordingly, you should not unduly rely on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. We undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events after the date of this Quarterly Report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should, however, review the factors and risks we describe in the reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  16    Table of Contents  Overview   We are a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function. We provide a comprehensive line of proprietary products and services that currently serve the sequencing, genotyping and gene expression markets. In the future, we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics. Our customers include leading genomic research centers, pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, clinical research organizations and biotechnology companies. Our tools provide researchers around the world with the performance, throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to perform the billions of genetic tests needed to extract valuable medical information through advances in genomics and proteomics. We believe this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological function, which will enhance drug discovery and clinical research, allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for individual patients.  Our Technologies  Sequencing Technology   Our DNA sequencing technology is based on the use of our sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) biochemistry. In SBS, single stranded DNA is extended from a priming site, one base at a time, using reversible terminator nucleotides. These are DNA bases which can be added to a growing second strand, but which initially cannot be further extended. This means that at each cycle of the chemistry, only one base can be added. Each base which is added includes a fluorescent label which is specific to the particular base. Thus following incorporation, the fluorescence can be imaged, its color determined, and the base itself can be inferred. Once this is done, an additional step removes both the fluorescence and the blocking group that had prevented further extension of the second strand. This allows another base to be added, and the cycle can be repeated. Our technology is capable of generating several billion bases of DNA sequence from a single run with a single sample preparation, dramatically reducing the cost and improving the practicality of sequencing on a large scale compared to conventional technologies.   In our DNA sequencing systems, we apply the SBS biochemistry on microscopic islands of DNA, referred to as DNA clusters. Each cluster starts as a single DNA molecule, typically a few hundred bases long, attached to the inside surface of a flow cell. We then use a proprietary amplification biochemistry to create copies of each starting molecule. As the copies are made, they are covalently linked to the surface, so they cannot diffuse away. After a number of cycles of amplification, each cluster might have 500 to 1,000 copies of the original starting molecule, but still be only about a micron (one-millionth of a meter) in diameter. By making so many copies, the fluorescent signal from each cluster is significantly increased. Because the clusters are so small, tens of millions of clusters can be independently formed inside a single flow cell. This large number of clusters can then be sequenced simultaneously by alternate cycles of SBS biochemistry and fluorescent imaging.  BeadArray Technology   Our BeadArray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform millions of assays simultaneously, enabling large-scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function in a unique high-throughput, cost effective, and flexible manner. We achieve high-throughput with a high density of test sites per array and we are able to format arrays either in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates or in various configurations in the format of standard microscope slides. We seek to maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive reagents and valuable samples, and through the low manufacturing costs associated with our technologies. Our ability to vary the size, shape and format of the well patterns and to create specific bead pools, or sensors, for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments. We believe that these features have enabled our BeadArray technology to become a leading platform for the high-growth market of SNP genotyping and have allowed us to be a key player in the gene expression market.   We have two primary BeadArray families of products, the GoldenGate genotyping products and our Infinium line of products. The GoldenGate family of products uses our Array Matrix which uses fiber optic bundles. Each bundle is comprised of approximately 50,000 individual fibers and 96 of these bundles are placed into an aluminum plate to form an Array Matrix. Our Infinium and Infinium High-Density (HD) BeadChips are microscope slide-size silicon wafers with varying numbers of sample sites per slide. The Infinium product family is capable of interrogating up to 1.2 million markers per sample and is our leading source of consumable revenue. Some of our products included in the Infinium family include Human1M-Duo, Human610-Quad, Human660W-Quad and HumanCytoSNP-12.  17    Table of Contents  VeraCode Technology   Our VeraCode technology enables cost-effective, high-throughput analysis of DNA, RNA and proteins at mid- to low- multiplex range. Multiplexing refers to the number of individual pieces of information that are simultaneously extracted from one sample. In addition to Life Science research applications, we believe the molecular diagnostics market will require systems that are extremely high throughput and cost effective in this mid- to low-multiplex range. We began shipping the BeadXpress System, which uses the VeraCode technology, for Life Science research applications during the first quarter of 2007, along with several assays for the system. In the research market, our customers may utilize our BeadArray technology for their higher multiplex projects and then move to our BeadXpress system for their lower multiplex projects utilizing the same assays.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   Except as set forth below, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended March 29, 2009. For further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008, which we filed with the SEC on February 26, 2009.  Convertible Senior Notes   We account for our Convertible Senior Notes in accordance with FASB Staff Position (FSP) Accounting Principles Board Opinions (APB) 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that May be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1 or the FSP). We adopted this FSP on December 29, 2008. It significantly impacts the accounting for our Convertible Senior Notes by requiring us to account separately for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt. The liability component is measured so the effective interest expense associated with the convertible debt reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate at the date of issuance for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature. The difference between the cash proceeds associated with the convertible debt and this estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the convertible debt.   Determining the fair value of the liability component requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the liability component and, in effect, the associated interest expense. According to the guidance, the carrying amount of the liability component is determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component. If no similar liabilities exist, estimates of fair value are primarily determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the liability component, including market interest rates, credit standing, yield curves and volatilities.  Results of Operations   To enhance comparability, the following table sets forth our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the specified reporting periods stated as a percentage of total revenue.  18    Table of Contents                              Three Months Ended       March 29,   March 30,       2009   2008     Revenue:                   Product revenue     94 %     91 %   Service and other revenue     6       9                         Total revenue     100       100                         Costs and expenses:                   Cost of product revenue     31       35     Cost of service and other revenue     2       3     Research and development     20       17     Selling, general and administrative     26       28     Amortization of intangible assets     1       2                         Total costs and expenses     80       85                         Income from operations     20       15     Interest and other expense, net     (3 )     (1 )                       Income before income taxes     17       14     Provision for income taxes     6       6                         Net income     11 %     8 %                         Three months Ended March 28, 2009 and March 30, 2008   Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending the Sunday closest to December 31, with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the Sunday closest to March 31, June 30 and September 30. The three months ended March 29, 2009 and March 30, 2008 were both 13 weeks.   Revenue                                      Three Months Ended               March 29,     March 30,     Percentage         2009     2008     Change         (in thousands)               Product revenue   $ 156,199     $ 110,683       41 %   Service and other revenue     9,558       11,178       (14 )                           Total revenue   $ 165,757     $ 121,861       36 %                              Product revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of consumables and instruments. The increase in product revenue was driven mostly by sales of our Infinium BeadChips, sequencing consumables and sequencing systems. Consumables and instruments constituted 66% and 32% of product revenue for the three months ended March 29, 2009, respectively, compared to 57% and 40% for the three months ended March 30, 2008, respectively.   Consumable revenue increased to $103.1 million for the three months ended March 29, 2009 compared to $63.2 million for the three months ended March 30, 2008. Growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to strong demand for our Infinium and sequencing products, which led to increased sales of $22.7 million and $17.3 million, respectively. The increase in revenue associated with our Infinium products can mainly be attributed to our Infinium whole-genome BeadChip products, specifically the transition from our Infinium II to our Infinium HD BeadChips. This transition resulted in a decrease in unit volume sales of BeadChips offset by an increase in average selling prices per BeadChip due to the evolution of our products to put more samples on one chip. Of the overall increase in Infinium whole-genome BeadChip sales, approximately 192% is due to higher average selling prices, offset by a volume decrease of approximately 92%. The increase in sequencing consumables is primarily attributable to the growth in our installed base of instruments and the progression of customer labs ramping to production scale.   Instrument revenue increased to $50.4 million for the three months ended March 29, 2009 compared to $44.5 million for the three months ended March 30, 2008. The increase in sales of our sequencing systems of $11.2 million was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $5.2 million in sales of our microarray systems. The growth in sequencing instrument revenue is primarily due to increased unit sales of the Genome Analyzer II with average selling prices remaining stable.  19    Table of Contents   Over the past several quarters, we have seen growth in product revenue, which can be mainly attributed to the anticipated launch of several new products, sales of existing products and the growth of our installed base of instruments.   Service and other revenue includes revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing service contracts, extended warranty contracts and research revenue. The decrease in service and other revenue was primarily due to a decline of $2.9 million in our Fast Track genotyping service contracts offset by an increase of $1.3 million in extended warranty sales. The decrease in Fast Track genotyping service contracts can be attributed to our shift towards CSPro certified customers. CSPro is a collaborative program through which we certify third party service partners using our products to ensure delivery of performance and data quality equivalent to that available from our internal service offering. The decline in service revenue as a result of the shift to CSPro certified customers has been offset by the resulting increase in our consumable sales to these third party service providers. We expect sales from SNP genotyping and sequencing service contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis, depending on the mix, the number of contracts completed and the success of our certified service providers. The timing of completion of SNP genotyping and sequencing service contracts is highly dependent on the customers’ schedules for delivering the SNPs and samples to us. We also expect to see continued increases in the sale of our extended warranty contracts as instrument sales continue to increase.  Cost of Product and Service and Other Revenue                                      Three Months Ended               March 29,     March 30,     Percentage         2009     2008     Change         (in thousands)               Cost of product revenue   $ 50,707     $ 42,526       19 %   Cost of service and other revenue     3,315       3,555       (7 )                           Total cost of revenue   $ 54,022     $ 46,081       17 %                              Cost of revenue, which excludes amortization of intangible assets, represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process, including component materials, assembly labor and overhead, installation, warranty, packaging and delivery costs, as well as costs associated with performing genotyping and sequencing services on behalf of our customers.   The increase in cost of product revenue was primarily driven by higher consumable sales. Cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue was 32% for the three months ended March 29, 2009 compared to 38% for the three months ended March 30, 2008. The decrease is primarily due to favorable product mix, driven by increased sales of our new High-Density Infinium Beadchips, with higher average selling prices as compared to the Infinium Beadchips sold in the first quarter of 2008. In addition, sequencing consumables cost of sales decreased as a percentage of related revenue due to improved overhead absorption from increased volumes and the benefit of decreased costs associated with the reformulation of our sequencing kits launched at the end of the third quarter of 2008. This was partially offset by increased instrument cost of sales as a percentage of related revenue over the prior year due primarily to an increase in provisions for inventory obsolescence of $1.0 million. The increase in the inventory reserve is primarily associated with sequencing instrument product transitions.   Cost of service and other revenue decreased primarily due to the decline in our Fast Track genotyping service contracts, slightly offset by higher extended warranty contract revenue. Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of related revenue was 35% for the three months ended March 29, 2009 compared to 32% for the three months ended March 30, 2008.   We expect product mix to continue to affect our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue. We expect price competition to continue in our market, and our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter as a result.  Research and Development                                      Three Months Ended           March 29,   March 30,   Percentage       2009   2008   Change       (in thousands)             Research and development   $ 32,726     $ 20,564       59 %     20    Table of Contents   Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. We expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred.   Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 20% for the three months ended March 29, 2009 compared to 17% for the three months ended March 30, 2008. Costs to support our BeadArray technology research activities increased $4.0 million for the three months ended March 29, 2009 compared to the three months ended March 30, 2008, primarily due to an overall increase in personnel-related expenses and increased lab and material expenses associated with the development of new products. The continued development of our sequencing technology resulted in increased research and development expenditures of $4.0 million for the three months ended March 29, 2009 compared to the three months ended March 30, 2008. In addition, expenses related to an agreement for exclusive licensing rights to certain new technologies under development of $2.0 million resulted in an increase in research and development expense for the three months ended March 29, 2009. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense increased by $1.3 million compared to three months ended March 30, 2008. Accrued compensation expense of $0.9 million associated with contingent consideration for the Avantome acquisition completed on August 1, 2008 also contributed to the increase in research and development expense for the three months ended March 29, 2009.   We believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into additional markets. Accordingly, we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our product base.  Selling, General and Administrative                                      Three Months Ended           March 29,   March 30,   Percentage       2009   2008   Change       (in thousands)             Selling, general and administrative   $ 42,831     $ 33,827       27 %      Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing, finance, human resources, business development, legal and general management, as well as professional fees, such as expenses for legal and accounting services. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26% for the three months ended March 29, 2009 compared to 28% for the three months ended March 30, 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 29, 2009 and March 30, 2008 included stock-based compensation expenses totaling $8.8 million and $6.1 million, respectively.   Sales and marketing expenses increased $4.4 million for the three months ended March 29, 2009 compared to the three months ended March 30, 2008. The increase is primarily due to increases of $3.5 million attributable to personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and commissions, to support the growth of our business. The remaining $0.9 million variance is due to an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.   General and administrative expense increased $4.6 million during the three months ended March 29, 2009 compared to the three months ended March 30, 2008 due to increases of $1.7 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $1.5 million in personnel-related expenses associated with the growth of our business, $0.9 million in legal costs and $0.5 million in outside consulting services.   We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our staff, add sales and marketing infrastructure and incur additional costs to support the expected growth in our business.  21    Table of Contents  Interest and Other Expense, Net                                      Three Months Ended           March 29,   March 30,   Percentage       2009   2008   Change       (in thousands)             Interest and other expense, net   $ (5,157 )   $ (843 )     512 %      Interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was $2.9 million for the three months ended March 29, 2009, compared to $3.7 million for the three months ended March 30, 2008. The decrease in interest income over the prior period was primarily driven by a change in our cash and investment portfolio to a mix of shorter duration maturities and an increased number of agency-rated investments coupled with an overall decline in interest rates due to current market conditions.   Interest expense related to our convertible debt was $5.7 million for the three months ended March 29, 2009 and $5.4 million for the three months ended March 30, 2008. Interest expense increased for both periods presented due to the adoption and retrospective application of APB FSP 14-1. Under this accounting method, our debt balance is accreted through the amortization of our debt discount to interest expense. Interest expense is calculated each period on the debt balance during the quarter using the effective yield method. The increase in interest expense over the prior period is due to the application of the straight debt rate to the accreted debt balance. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2009, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.8 million due to the conversion of Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. This gain was calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the converted Notes and their fair value as of the settlement date in accordance with APB FSP 14-1. Refer to Note 7 in the condensed consolidated financial statements for further description.   We recorded a $3.2 million loss and a $0.9 million gain resulting from our net foreign currency transactions for the three months ended March 29, 2009 and March 30, 2008, respectively. The variance is due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our net foreign currency transactions coupled with a change in our foreign entity functional currency designation from the local currency to the U.S. dollar beginning the third quarter of 2008. As a result of this change, beginning in the third quarter of 2008, the Company remeasures its foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities and income and expense accounts related to monetary assets and liabilities to the U.S. dollar and records the net gains or losses resulting from remeasurement in its consolidated statements of operations within interest and other expense, net. Previously, under local functional currency designation, the effects of translation were recorded within stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income (loss).  Provision for Income Taxes                                      Three Months Ended           March 29,   March 30,   Percentage       2009   2008   Change       (in thousands)             Provision for income taxes   $ 10,540     $ 7,388       43 %      The provision for income taxes consists of federal, state, and foreign income tax expenses. The increase in the provision for income taxes for the three ended March 29, 2009 compared to the three months ended March 30, 2008 was primarily driven by the increase in the income before income taxes, partially offset by a change in the proportion of income earned in lower tax jurisdictions.   As of December 28, 2008, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $87.7 million and $148.3 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2025 and 2013, respectively, unless previously utilized. In addition, we also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $12.6 million and $13.9 million respectively, which begin to expire in 2018 and 2019, respectively, unless previously utilized.   Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in our ownership structure. These annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization. Previous limitations due to Section 382 and 383 have been reflected in the deferred tax assets as of March 29, 2009.  22    Table of Contents   Based upon the available evidence as of March 29, 2009, we are not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $2.8 million and $11.7 million against certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively.   As of March 29, 2009, no material changes have been made to our uncertain tax positions recorded in accordance with FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.

Our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with:        •   cash used for operating activities such as the purchase and growth of inventory, expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development infrastructure and other working capital needs;        •   cash paid for litigation settlements;        •   cash used for our stock repurchases;        •   expenditures related to increasing our manufacturing capacity and improving our manufacturing efficiency;        •   cash paid for acquisitions and investments;        •   cash paid for the conversion of a portion of our senior convertible notes; and        •   interest payments on the outstanding senior convertible notes.        Other factors that impact our cash inflow and outflow include:        •   significant increases in our product and services revenue. As our product sales have increased significantly since 2001, operating income has increased significantly as well, providing us with an increased source of cash to finance the expansion of our operations; and        •   fluctuations in our working capital.    23    Table of Contents      As of March 29, 2009, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $728.5 million, compared to $696.0 million as of December 28, 2008. Included in the investment balance as of March 29, 2009 were auction rate securities of $55.9 million issued primarily by municipalities and universities. At December 28, 2008 the fair value of the Company’s auction rate securities was $47.2 million. During the three months ended March 29, 2009, the Company recorded a gain of $1.7 million resulting in an increase to the fair value of the Company’s auction rate securities to $48.9 million at March 29, 2009. We based our fair value determination on estimated discounted future cash flows of interest income over a projected period reflective of the length of time we anticipate it will take the securities to become liquid. Additionally, we classified these securities as long-term investments as of March 29, 2009 as we believe we may not be able to liquidate our investments within the next year.   In November 2008, we signed a settlement agreement allowing us to sell our auction rate securities at par value to UBS at our discretion during the period of June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. To account for this settlement, we recorded a put option at fair value, which approximates the difference between the par value and fair value of the auction rate securities. Gains and losses associated with the put option are recognized in earnings approximately equal to changes in the fair value of the auction rate securities at each balance sheet date. As of March 29, 2009, the put option totaled $7.0 million.   The primary inflow of cash during the three months ended March 29, 2009 was approximately $162.3 million from the sale and maturity of our investments in available-for-sale securities and approximately $13.1 million from the exercise of our stock options. The primary cash outflows during the three months ended March 29, 2009 were attributable to the purchase of available-for-sale securities for approximately $171.6 million.   In January 2009, we executed a strategic alliance with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), which consists of a commercialization agreement and equity investment. The cash outflow of $18.0 million was in exchange for the equity investment. Further, we have agreed to make an additional equity investment upon the achievement of a specific technical milestone.   Our primary short-term needs for capital, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to:       •   our facilities expansion needs, including costs of leasing additional facilities;        •   the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development facilities;        •   support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products, including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources both in the United States and abroad;        •   potential strategic acquisitions and investments;        •   the continued advancement of research and development efforts; and        •   improvements in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency.     We expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating income, as well as the status of each of our new product development programs, will significantly impact our cash management decisions.   Our outstanding senior convertible notes (the Notes) were convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock for the period from April 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008 and became convertible again beginning April 1, 2009 and will continue to be convertible at least through, and including, June 30, 2009. On December 29, 2008, a Noteholder converted Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. On February 4, 2009, the settlement date, we paid the Noteholder the conversion value of the Notes in cash, up to the principal amount of the Notes. The excess of the conversion value over the principal amount, totaling $2.9 million, was paid in shares of common stock. This equity dilution upon conversion of the Notes was offset by the reacquisition of the shares under the convertible note hedge transactions (the Hedge) entered into in connection with the offering of the Notes. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the terms of the Notes.  24    Table of Contents   We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next 12 months, barring unforeseen circumstances. Operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. At the present time, we have no material commitments for capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including:       •   our ability to successfully evolve our technologies and create innovative products in our markets;        •   scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs;        •   competing technological and market developments; and        •   the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings.     As a result of the factors listed above, we may require additional funding in the future. Our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms, when needed, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   Refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008, which we filed with the SEC on February 26, 2009, for a description of the effect of recently-issued accounting pronouncements.     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   There have been no material changes from the reported market risks disclosed in that section of our Form 10-K.     Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   We design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that (1) our transactions are properly authorized; (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly recorded and reported in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also maintain internal controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and our established financial policies.   We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act), as of March 29, 2009. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of March 29, 2009, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.   An evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the first quarter of 2009 and that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. That evaluation did not identify any such change.  25    Table of Contents     PART II — OTHER INFORMATION     Item 1. Legal Proceedings.   From time to time, the Company is party to litigation in the ordinary course of business. While management does not believe that our pending legal matters will have a material adverse impact on us, the results of any litigation are typically uncertain.     ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.   Our business is subject to various risks, including those described in Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008, which we filed with the SEC on February 26, 2009 and strongly encourage you to review. There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in that section of our Form 10-K.     Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
