Item 1A. Risk FactorsWith the exception of the following, there have been no material changes in the risk factors that appear in Part I - Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013:Risks Relating to the Company’s Pending Acquisition of Covance Inc.The closing of the Merger is subject to many conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger will not be completed. The closing of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement that must be satisfied or waived, including, among others, receipt of the requisite vote from the stockholders of Covance to approve the Merger, the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), the absence of any law or order prohibiting the closing of the merger, the declaration by the SEC of the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed by the Company in respect of the shares of the Company common stock to be issued in the merger, and the approval of the listing on the New York Stock Exchange of the shares of the Company common stock to be issued in the Merger. There can be no assurance as to whether or when the conditions to the closing of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or as to whether or when the Merger will be consummated. The requirement to obtain regulatory approval may prevent or substantially delay the Merger, or result in the imposition of conditions that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations or the operations of the acquired business following completion of the Merger.Completion of the pending transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental clearances or approvals that have not yet been obtained, including, without limitation, the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. Under the provisions of the HSR Act, the merger may not be completed until notification and report forms have been filed with the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the expiration of a statutory waiting period, or the early termination of that waiting period, following the parties’ filing of their respective notification and report forms. The waiting period with respect to the notifications filed under the HSR Act will expire 30 calendar days after the Company and Covance file their respective notification and report forms pursuant to the HSR Act, unless otherwise extended or terminated. The FTC or DOJ may effectively extend the statutory waiting period by requesting additional information regarding the merger and its potential effects on competition. Also, at any time before or after completion of the merger, the FTC or the DOJ could act under the antitrust laws to prevent a substantial lessening of competition or the creation of a monopoly, including by seeking to enjoin completion of the transaction or seeking divestiture of assets, businesses or product lines of the Company or Covance.There can be no assurance that approval under the HSR Act and other required clearances and approvals will be obtained or, if obtained, will not be later challenged by governmental entities. Third parties could also petition to have governmental entities reconsider previously granted clearances and approvals. In addition, the governmental entities from which clearances and approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the transaction, require changes to the terms of the transaction or impose restrictions on the Company’s business following completion of the transaction. If the transaction is not completed, completion is delayed or the Company becomes subject to any significant conditions in order to obtain any clearances or approvals required to complete the transaction, its business and results of operations may be adversely affected and its stock price may suffer.The Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be consummated. Either the Company or Covance may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including, among other reasons, if the Merger is not completed by June 2, 2015. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement relating to the failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals for the Merger, 35INDEXthe Company may be required to pay Covance a termination fee of $305 million. As a consequence of the proposed acquisition, the Company expects to materially reduce its cash balance and take on substantial additional indebtedness.To fund the consideration to be paid to Covance stockholders pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company expects to use approximately $4.25 billion in cash and to issue approximately 15.55 million shares of the Company’s common stock. In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into a Commitment Letter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo. The Commitment Letter provides for a $4.25 billion senior unsecured bridge term loan credit facility comprised of a $3.85 billion 364-day unsecured debt bridge tranche and a $400 million 60-day cash bridge tranche (the “Bridge Facility”). The Commitment Letter is subject to various conditions, including the absence of a material adverse effect on Covance having occurred, the execution of satisfactory documents and other customary closing conditions. The Company expects to replace some or all of the Bridge Facility prior to the closing of the Merger with permanent financing comprising senior unsecured notes and a term loan facility. However, the Company may not be able to supplement the debt financing in a timely manner, or at all. The Company’s potential lower cash balance and increased indebtedness resulting from the proposed acquisition financing could adversely affect its business. In particular, it could increase the Company’s vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit its ability to obtain further financing and limit its ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities.It may be difficult to integrate the business of Covance into the Company’s current business and the Company may fail to realize the anticipated revenue growth expected from the transaction, which could adversely affect its operating results and the market price of its common stock.If the Company experiences greater than anticipated costs to integrate Covance into its existing operations or is not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, its business and results of operations could be negatively affected. In addition, it is possible that the ongoing integration process could result in the loss of key employees, errors or delays in systems implementation, the disruption of the Company’s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the Company’s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources.These integration matters may have an adverse effect on the Company, particularly during any transition period. In addition, although Covance is subject to many of the same risks and uncertainties that the Company faces in its business, the acquisition of Covance also involves the Company entering new product and services areas, markets and industries, which presents risks resulting from the Company’s relative inexperience in these new areas. Covance’s laboratory testing business could react differently to economic and other external factors than the Company’s. The Company faces the risk that it will not be successful with these new products and services or in these new markets.The success of the proposed transaction will depend, in significant part, on the Company’s ability to successfully integrate the acquired business and realize the anticipated benefits to be derived from incorporating Covance into its operations. The Company believes that the acquisition will provide an opportunity for revenue growth in development and commercialization of drugs and diagnostics and nutritional analysis and other areas, including a number of new business areas for the Company. Actual revenue growth, if any, may be lower than the Company expects and may take longer to achieve than anticipated, and expenses may be higher than the Company expects. If the Company is not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the pending acquisition, the value of its common stock may be adversely affected.The Company has made certain assumptions relating to the acquisition that may prove to be materially inaccurate.The Company has made certain assumptions relating to the acquisition that may prove to be materially inaccurate, including as a result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition, a longer acquisition and transition process than expected, higher than expected transaction and integration costs and unknown liabilities, as well as general economic and business conditions that adversely affect the combined company following the acquisition. These assumptions relate to numerous matters, including:•the Company’s assessments of the asset quality and value of Covance and its assets;•projections of the business and Covance’s future financial performance;•the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness on attractive terms in order to complete the acquisition and provide financial flexibility for its plans for growth;•the Company’s ability to realize synergies and the timeline for doing so;36INDEX•acquisition costs, including restructuring charges and transaction costs;•the Company’s ability to maintain, develop and deepen relationships with Covance’s customers; and•other financial and strategic risks of the acquisition.If one or more of these assumptions are incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and operating results, and the perceived benefits from the acquisition may not be realized.The Company will be subject to business uncertainties until consummation of the Merger.Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on the business of the Company. These uncertainties could disrupt the business of the Company and cause customers, suppliers, vendors, partners and others that deal with the Company to defer entering into contracts with the Company or making other decisions concerning the Company or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with the Company. The Company will incur significant transaction and merger-related costs in connection with the Merger. The Company has incurred and expects to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Merger. These costs and expenses include fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, facilities and systems consolidation costs, severance and other potential employment-related costs, including payments that may be made to certain Covance executives, filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges. There are also a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the Merger and the integration of the two companies’ businesses. While the Company has assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, there are many factors beyond its control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses.  There may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the Merger that the Company may not recoup. These costs and expenses could reduce the realization of efficiencies, strategic benefits and additional income the Company expects to achieve from the Merger. Although the Company expects that these benefits will offset the transaction expenses and implementation costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all. Covance will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the acquisition is pending and thereafter, which could adversely affect its financial results and the ability to retain key employees.Uncertainty about the effect of the acquisition on Covance’s customers, employees or suppliers may have an adverse effect on Covance. Although Covance intends to take steps to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair its ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the acquisition is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause disruptions in its relationships with customers, suppliers and other parties with which it deals.In particular, the Company considers Covance’s strong management team an attractive aspect of Covance. The loss of members of the Covance senior management team could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to operate the Covance business and integrate it into the Company’s consolidated operations. Retention of these key members may be particularly challenging prior to and even for a period after the completion of the acquisition, as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If, despite retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with Covance following the acquisition, its business operations and financial results could be adversely affected.The Company also expects that matters relating to the acquisition and integration-related issues will place a significant burden on Covance’s management, employees and internal resources, which could otherwise have been devoted to other business opportunities and improvements. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts Covance, without the Company’s consent, from taking certain specified actions until the acquisition is consummated. These restrictions may have the effect of preventing Covance from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes or improvements to its business prior to consummation of the acquisition.Covance’s business is subject to risks that may be different than the ones facing the Company, and the Company may have difficulty appropriately managing those risks.Although Covance is subject to many of the same risks and uncertainties that the Company faces in its business, Covance’s business also involves the Company entering product and services areas, markets and industries that are different than those in which the Company is currently engaged. This presents risks resulting from the Company’s relative inexperience in these 37INDEXareas.The Company faces the risk that it will not be successful with these new products and services or in these new markets and that it will not be able to manage these risks, which include:•a greater reliance on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries for revenues;•exposure to fixed price contracts that differ from those with which the Company has historically dealt;•exposure to competition that is different from the competition the Company currently faces;•new regulatory requirements in both industries and geographies that are new to the Company;•liabilities from contract research services arising from the conduct of drug development trials and studies;•actions of animal rights activists; and•risks related to diseases in animals used in research.The proposed Merger may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to the Company's earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of the Company's common stock. Because shares of the Company's common stock would be issued in the Merger, it is possible that the Merger will be dilutive to the Company's earnings per share, which could negatively affect the market price of shares of the Company's common stock. In connection with the completion of the proposed Merger, based on the number of issued and outstanding shares of the Company's common stock and Covance common stock as of October 31, 2014, the Company would issue approximately 15.55 shares of common stock. The issuance of these new shares of common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price of shares of the Company's common stock, through dilution of earnings per share or otherwise. In addition, future events and conditions could increase the dilution that is currently projected, including adverse changes in market conditions, additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the merger. Any dilution of, or delay of any accretion to, the Company's earnings per share could cause the price of shares of the Company's common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate.Item 2.
