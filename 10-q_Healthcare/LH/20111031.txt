Item 1A   Risk Factors           The following risk factor is added to those that appear in Part I-Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.           The Company’s growing international operations could subject it to additional expenses and risks that could adversely impact the business or results of operations.            The expansion of the Company’s international operations could subject it to additional expenses that the Company may not fully anticipate. The Company operates in a heavily regulated industry, and these expenses could include those related to enhanced time and resources necessary to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those in the United States. International operations also expose the Company to additional risks, including:             ·    failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those under which the Company operates in the United States;      ·     restrictions on currency repatriation;      ·     greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;      ·     difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;      ·     adverse changes in tax policies and other laws;      ·     procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services;      ·     less protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;      ·     judicial systems that less strictly enforce contractual rights;      ·     export controls and trade regulations; and      ·    natural disasters, epidemics, political instability and acts of war or terrorism.              In some countries, the Company’s success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. The Company’s inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements could adversely affect the business and operations. International operations may result in increased expense and risk to the Company’s business and could give rise to unanticipated liabilities or difficulties that could adversely affect its operations and financial results.           30      INDEX                Item 2.
