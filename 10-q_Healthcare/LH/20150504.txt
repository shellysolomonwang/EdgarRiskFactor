Item 1A. Risk FactorsThe risk factor set forth below revises and supplements the corresponding risk factor set forth in Part I - Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. With the exception of the following, there have been no material changes in the risk factors that appear in Part 1 - Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.Failure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and damage to the Company’s reputation with customers and have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business.The federal HIPAA privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under HITECH, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by health plans, health care providers, and health care clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of protected health information. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:•the circumstances under which the use and disclosure of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the Company’s services, and its health care operations activities;•a patient’s right to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information;•the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information;•administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information; and•the protection of computing systems maintaining PHI.The Company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, as required by law. The privacy and security regulations establish a “floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, the Company is required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws and regulations. The federal privacy regulations restrict the Company’s ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or health care operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. In addition, other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. For instance, the Company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure or confidential health information or other private personal information.In addition, laws and regulations of the European Union, as well as other countries, protect the use and disclosure of personal information. Compliance with these laws and regulations may result in increased costs and failure to comply may result in significant fines, penalties and damage to the Company’s reputation with customers.Item 2.
