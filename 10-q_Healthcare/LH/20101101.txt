Item 1A   Risk Factors           The following risk factors are provided to supplement the Risk Factors that appear in Part I-Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.   Risks relating to the Company’s pending acquisition of Genzyme Genetics, a business unit of Genzyme Corporation.   The pending transaction may not be completed, may be delayed or may result in the imposition of conditions that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations or the operations of the acquired business following completion of the transaction.    In addition to other customary closing conditions, completion of the pending transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental clearances or approvals that have not yet been obtained, including, without limitation, the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. There can be no assurance that these clearances and approvals will be obtained or, if obtained, will not be later challenged by governmental entities. Third parties could also petition to have governmental entities reconsider previously granted clearances and approvals. In addition, the governmental entities from which clearances and approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the transaction, require changes to the terms of the transaction or impose restrictions on the Company’s business following completion of the transaction. If the transaction is not completed, completion is delayed or the Company becomes subject to any significant conditions in order to obtain any clearances or approvals required to complete the transaction, its business and results of operations may be adversely affected and its stock price may suffer. Under certain circumstances a delay in obtaining required approvals beyond the date provided for in the acquisition agreement could result in the Company having to pay a termination fee to Genzyme.   The Company may fail to realize the anticipated revenue growth expected from the transaction, which could adversely affect its operating results and the market price of its common stock.    The success of the proposed transaction will depend, in significant part, on the Company’s ability to successfully integrate the acquired business and realize the anticipated benefits to be derived from incorporating Genzyme Genetics into its operations. The Company believes that the acquisition will provide an opportunity for revenue growth in the areas of esoteric testing and personalized medicine. Actual revenue growth, if achieved at all, may be lower than the Company expects and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. If the Company is not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the pending acquisition, the value of its common stock may be adversely affected.   The integration of the acquired assets will be complex and involve a number of risks. Failure to successfully integrate the respective operations could significantly harm the Company’s business and results of operations.    Because of the structure of the transaction, as an asset carve out from Genzyme Corporation, the Company will not be integrating a stand-alone enterprise when the Company completes this transaction. Integrating the operations will be complex and there is no assurance that the Company will not encounter material delays or unanticipated costs that could adversely affect its business and results of operations.           31      INDEX             As a consequence of the proposed acquisition, the Company may materially reduce its cash balance and take on substantial additional indebtedness.    Pursuant to the terms of the Company’s acquisition agreement to acquire Genzyme Genetics, the total consideration to be paid by the Company is $925.0 in cash, subject to a limited purchase price adjustment related to the acquired working capital. The Company has entered into a 364-day bridge term loan credit agreement to provide debt financing for the transaction, subject to customary conditions. The Company expects to consider opportunities to replace that facility either before or after the closing of the acquisition, which could include replacing that debt financing through an offering in the debt capital markets. However, the Company may not be able to replace or refinance the bridge facility in a timely manner, or at all. The Company’s potential lower cash balance and increased indebtedness resulting from the proposed acquisition financing could adversely affect its business. In particular, it could increase the Company’s vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit its ability to obtain further financing and limit its ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities.
