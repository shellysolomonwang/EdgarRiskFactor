Item 1A. Risk Factors”) included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars.  Executive Summary  We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need. Our mission is to advance the care of patients suffering from life-threatening diseases worldwide. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America, Europe and Australia. Currently, we market Truvada® (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), Atripla® (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), Viread® (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and Emtriva® (emtricitabine) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; Hepsera® (adefovir dipivoxil) and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B; AmBisome® (amphotericin B) liposome for injection for the treatment of severe fungal infections; Letairis® (ambrisentan) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Vistide® (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection; and Flolan® (epoprostenol sodium) for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate) worldwide for the treatment and prevention of influenza under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. markets Macugen® (pegaptanib sodium injection) in the United States and Europe for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us.  Our operating results for the second quarter of 2008 were led by product sales of $1.22 billion. Antiviral product sales (Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva) of $1.12 billion, which increased by 34% in the second quarter of 2008 from the second quarter of 2007, were the key drivers for total product sales growth of 34% in the second quarter of 2008 as compared to the second quarter of 2007. Truvada product sales for the second quarter of 2008 increased by $130.8 million, or 34%, from the second quarter of 2007. Atripla product     16    Table of Contents  sales for the second quarter of 2008 increased by $142.7 million, or 67%, from the second quarter of 2007. The increase in Truvada and Atripla product sales in the second quarter of 2008 as compared to the second quarter of 2007 was driven primarily by sales volume growth. Hepsera product sales for the second quarter of 2008 increased 20% from the second quarter of 2007, driven primarily by sales volume growth in certain European markets, as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. AmBisome product sales in the second quarter of 2008 increased by 8% from the second quarter of 2007 driven primarily by a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Under our collaborations with corporate partners, we recognized $50.6 million in royalty revenues in the second quarter of 2008, of which $37.5 million related to royalties received from first quarter 2008 sales of Tamiflu by Roche. Due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007, foreign currency denominated product sales experienced a net benefit from the foreign currency fluctuations. This resulted in a favorable impact of approximately $45.2 million on total revenues and $20.7 million on pre-tax income in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007.  In April 2008, the European Commission granted marketing authorization on our Type II variation application to extend the indication for Viread to include the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults in all 27 member states of the European Union. Additionally, in April 2008, Viread was approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in New Zealand and Turkey. We currently have marketing applications for Viread for chronic hepatitis B under review in the United States, Australia and Canada.  During the second quarter of 2008, we continued to make progress on the development of our compounds and drug candidates. In the HIV area, in July 2008, we began dosing patients in the first of two Phase 3 clinical studies for elvitegravir (GS 9137), our novel integrase inhibitor for HIV, which we licensed from Japan Tobacco Inc. in 2005. In the hepatitis C area, we continue to screen patients in the continuation of the Phase 1b study of GS 9190, a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, and completed the dosing of this study in July 2008. Pending receipt of positive results from this study, we anticipate beginning the Phase 2 study in patients infected with the hepatitis C virus by the end of 2008. In the cardiovascular area, we continued to enroll patients in our two Phase 3 clinical studies for darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension. We expect to complete enrollment and receive data from these two studies in 2009.  In May 2008, we executed an asset purchase agreement with Navitas Assets, LLC (Navitas) to acquire all of the assets related to its cicletanine business. We acquired the exclusive rights to regulatory data and filings for development of cicletanine as a monotherapy for PAH and for other indications in the United States. We plan to evaluate cicletanine as a potential treatment of PAH. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition was $10.9 million, and consisted primarily of cash paid. In addition, Navitas is entitled to potential additional purchase consideration, including payments contingent on future achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones.  Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $185.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2008, driven primarily by our operating cash flows of $1.00 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2008, offset by common stock repurchases of $965.8 million under our stock repurchase program.  As certain criteria were met as of June 30, 2008, our convertible senior notes became eligible for conversion during the quarter ending September 30, 2008. As a result, we reclassified our $1.30 billion convertible senior notes from long-term liabilities to current liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2008. The continued conversion eligibility of our convertible senior notes in future quarters will depend on the closing price of our common stock during the last 30 consecutive trading days of each quarter, which will determine whether our convertible senior notes will be classified as current or long-term liabilities within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the end of each quarter.  In July and through August 7, 2008, we repurchased and retired 4,600,000 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $53.05 for an aggregate purchase price of $244.1 million, through open market     17    Table of Contents  transactions. As of August 7, 2008, the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under our stock repurchase program which expires in December 2010 was $1.76 billion.  We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as funds available through our credit facility will continue to allow us to further our corporate development initiatives, as well as to meet our ongoing working capital and infrastructure needs.  Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments  There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments during the quarter ended June 30, 2008 compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.  Results of Operations  Total Revenues  Total revenues were $1.28 billion for the second quarter of 2008 and $1.05 billion for the second quarter of 2007. Total revenues were $2.54 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2008 and $2.08 billion for the same period in 2007. Included in total revenues were product sales, royalty revenues and contract and other revenues.  Product Sales  The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands, except percentages):                              Three Months EndedJune 30,   Change     Six Months EndedJune 30,   Change        2008   2007     2008   2007     Antiviral products:                           Truvada   $ 516,149   $ 385,360   34 %   $ 995,534   $ 731,298   36 %   Atripla     355,101     212,384   67 %     679,318     402,567   69 %   Viread     150,681     154,897   (3 )%     303,348     315,575   (4 )%   Hepsera     90,365     75,173   20 %     173,387     146,517   18 %   Emtriva     8,088     9,604   (16 )%     16,477     17,927   (8 )%                                     Total antiviral products     1,120,384     837,418   34 %     2,168,064     1,613,884   34 %   AmBisome     69,768     64,754   8 %     140,796     126,256   12 %   Other     27,064     2,886   838 %     49,662     5,143   866 %                                     Total product sales   $ 1,217,216   $ 905,058   34 %   $ 2,358,522   $ 1,745,283   35 %                                    Total product sales increased by 34% and 35% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2007, due primarily to an overall increase in our antiviral product sales including the strong growth of Atripla sales primarily from its continued uptake in the United States and the recent launches in certain European countries, as well as the continued growth of Truvada sales in the United States and Europe. Due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies, foreign currency denominated product sales experienced a net benefit from the foreign currency fluctuations of approximately $45.2 million and $82.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2007.    18    Table of Contents Antiviral Products  Antiviral product sales increased by 34% for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, compared to the same periods in 2007, driven primarily by sales volume growth of Truvada and Atripla, as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact.        •    Truvada   Truvada sales increased by 34% and 36% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2007, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe, as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Truvada sales accounted for 46% of our total antiviral product sales for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2008.        •    Atripla   Atripla sales increased by 67% and 69% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2007, driven primarily by strong sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. We consolidate 100% of Atripla product sales because we are the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) in the United States. The efavirenz portion of these Atripla sales was approximately $130.5 million and $250.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, and approximately $78.5 million and $148.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively. Atripla was approved for sale in the United States and in the European Union in July 2006 and December 2007, respectively. Atripla sales accounted for 32% and 31% of our total antiviral product sales in the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively.        •    Viread   Viread sales decreased by 3% and 4% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2007, driven primarily by lower sales volumes in the United States and Europe, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Lower sales volumes were due primarily to patients switching from a Viread-containing regimen to one containing Truvada and/or Atripla in countries where Truvada and/or Atripla is available.        •    Hepsera  Hepsera sales increased by 20% and 18% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2007, driven primarily by a favorable foreign currency exchange impact and sales volume growth in certain European markets.  AmBisome  AmBisome sales increased by 8% and 12% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2007, driven primarily by a favorable foreign currency exchange impact.  For the full year of 2008, we expect total product sales to continue to grow as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts, including our continued launch of Atripla in additional European countries, as well as Viread for chronic hepatitis B in Europe.  Royalty Revenues  The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands, except percentages):                              Three Months EndedJune 30,   Change     Six Months EndedJune 30,   Change        2008   2007     2008   2007     Royalty revenues   $ 50,608   $ 135,747   (63 )%   $ 160,060   $ 316,209   (49 )%    19    Table of Contents Royalty revenues decreased by 63% and 49% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2007, driven primarily by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $37.5 million and $130.9 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, compared to Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $123.1 million and $291.0 million recognized in the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively. The decrease in Tamiflu royalties is due to the lower Tamiflu sales recorded by Roche for the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 compared to the same periods in the prior years, including decreased sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which the product is sold.  Roche reported in January 2008, April 2008 and July 2008 that it expects a significant decrease in Tamiflu sales in 2008 compared to 2007; therefore, we expect our royalty revenues for 2008 to be significantly lower compared to 2007.  Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin  The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our total product sales and cost of goods sold (each, in thousands, except percentages) and our product gross margin:                                  Three Months EndedJune 30,     Change     Six Months EndedJune 30,     Change        2008     2007       2008     2007       Total product sales   $ 1,217,216     $ 905,058     34 %   $ 2,358,522     $ 1,745,283     35 %   Cost of goods sold   $ 265,684     $ 183,131     45 %   $ 505,532     $ 354,769     42 %   Product gross margin     78.2 %     79.8 %         78.6 %     79.7 %      Product gross margin for the second quarter of 2008 was 78.2%, compared to 79.8% for the second quarter of 2007. Product gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was 78.6%, compared to 79.7% for the same period in 2007. The lower product gross margins for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 compared to the same periods in 2007 were due primarily to the higher proportion of Atripla sales, which include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin.  We expect product gross margin for the full year of 2008 to be slightly lower than that of 2007, due primarily to a higher mix of Atripla product sales, partially offset by product gross margin improvements driven by lower active pharmaceutical ingredients costs.  Research and Development Expenses  The following table summarizes the period over period changes in the major components of our research and development (R&D) expenses (in thousands, except percentages):                              Three Months EndedJune 30,   Change     Six Months EndedJune 30,   Change        2008   2007     2008   2007     Research   $ 40,757   $ 29,763   37 %   $ 75,266   $ 59,956   26 %   Clinical development     109,987     85,970   28 %     204,755     164,281   25 %   Pharmaceutical development     25,798     20,198   28 %     51,822     41,784   24 %                                     Total research and development   $ 176,542   $ 135,931   30 %   $ 331,843   $ 266,021   25 %                                    R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs. Our R&D activities are separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research     20    Table of Contents  costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs. Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials. Pharmaceutical development expenses consist of costs for product formulation and chemical analysis.  R&D expenses for the second quarter of 2008 increased by $40.6 million compared to the same quarter of 2007, due primarily to increased clinical study expenses of $17.7 million primarily in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas, as well as increased compensation and benefit expenses of $15.1 million due primarily to higher headcount.  R&D expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2008 increased by $65.8 million compared to the same period in 2007, due primarily to increased clinical study expenses of $35.9 million primarily in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas, as well as increased compensation and benefit expenses of $22.0 million due primarily to higher headcount.  We expect R&D expenses for the full year of 2008 to be higher than that of 2007, reflecting increased spending on our internal and collaborative R&D efforts relating to the progress of our product candidates into more advanced clinical studies, as well as the continuation of our existing clinical trials.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  The following summarizes the period over period changes in our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (in thousands, except percentages):                              Three Months EndedJune 30,   Change     Six Months EndedJune 30,   Change        2008   2007     2008   2007     Selling, general and administrative   $ 219,533   $ 186,179   18 %   $ 414,490   $ 352,737   18 %  SG&A expenses for the second quarter of 2008 increased by $33.4 million compared to the same quarter of 2007, due primarily to costs of $12.4 million associated with certain termination-related disputes in our international operations, as well as increased marketing and promotional expenses of $8.8 million including those related to the launch of Atripla in certain European countries. A higher headcount also resulted in increased compensation and benefit expenses of $13.9 million for the second quarter of 2008 compared to the same quarter of 2007. The increase in compensation and benefit expenses was partially offset by the decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $9.8 million due primarily to the change in the vesting schedule of the annual stock option grants made to our board of directors during the second quarter of 2008 compared to the same quarter of 2007.  SG&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2008 increased by $61.8 million compared to the same period in 2007, due primarily to increased marketing and promotional expenses of $16.3 million including those related to the launch of Atripla in certain European countries, other consulting and support services expenses of $13.0 million related to the growth in our business, as well as costs of $12.4 million associated with certain termination-related disputes in our international operations. A higher headcount also resulted in increased compensation and benefit expenses of $27.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. The increase in compensation and benefit expenses was partially offset by the decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $25.9 million due primarily to the higher expense associated with unvested stock options that we assumed from the Myogen, Inc. (Myogen) acquisition in 2006 and which continue to vest, including accelerated stock-based compensation expense from certain Myogen employee transitions during the six months ended June 30, 2007, as well as a change in the vesting schedule of the annual stock option grants made to our board of directors during the six months ended June 30, 2008 compared to the same period of 2007.    21    Table of Contents We expect SG&A expenses for the full year of 2008 to be higher than that of 2007 due primarily to the continued growth in our business and the costs of supporting higher headcount and expanded operations, including the continued expansion of our international operations, as well as increased sales and marketing efforts to support the growth of our product franchises.  Purchased In-process Research and Development Expenses  In connection with our acquisitions of Myogen and Corus Pharma, Inc. (Corus) in 2006, we recorded purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) expenses of $2.06 billion and $335.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2006.  The purchased IPR&D expense for Myogen represented the estimated fair value of Myogen’s incomplete R&D programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. A summary of these programs at the acquisition date, updated for subsequent changes in status of development, is as follows:                Program    Description    Status of Development   EstimatedAcquisition DateFair Value(in millions)    Ambrisentan   An orally active, non-sulfonamide, propanoic acid-class, endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) for the treatment of PAH.   Phase 3 clinical trials were completed prior to the acquisition date. We filed an NDA with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2006, and in June 2007, the FDA approved Letairis for the treatment of PAH in the United States. Additionally, in March 2007, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) validated the marketing authorization application for ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH, filed by our collaboration partner, GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK). In February 2008, ambrisentan received a positive opinion from the CHMP for the treatment of PAH, and in April 2008, the European Commission granted GSK marketing authorization for ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH which will be marketed under the name Volibris by GSK.   $ 1,413.7        Darusentan   An orally active ETA-selective ERA for the treatment of resistant hypertension.   In Phase 3 clinical development as of the acquisition date and the date of this filing.   $ 644.5  The remaining efforts for completing the darusentan IPR&D program consist primarily of clinical trials, the cost, length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict, and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. Numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development, including the ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. Feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical trials might require modifications to or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed. We cannot be certain that darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension will be approved in the United States or in countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. Future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for     22    Table of Contents  review, which may differ materially from current projections. Darusentan may never be successfully commercialized. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of darusentan if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If this program cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of this project will materialize as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.  The purchased IPR&D expense for Corus represented the estimated fair value of Corus’s incomplete inhaled aztreonam lysine for cystic fibrosis (CF) R&D program that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. A description of this program at the acquisition date, updated for subsequent changes in status of development, is as follows:                Program    Description    Status of Development   EstimatedAcquisition DateFair Value(in millions)   Inhaled aztreonam lysine for CF   Aztreonam formulation for inhalation to be used against Gram-negative bacteria that cause lung infections in patients with CF.   In Phase 3 clinical trials as of the acquisition date. We filed an NDA with the FDA in November 2007 and have been granted a target review date of September 2008.   $ 335.6  The remaining efforts for completing Corus’s IPR&D program consist primarily of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. Failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals is a risk that could prevent completion of development. Feedback from regulatory authorities might require additional trials to be performed. We cannot be certain that aztreonam lysine for inhalation for the treatment of CF will be approved in the United States or in countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. Aztreonam lysine for inhalation may never be successfully commercialized. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of aztreonam lysine for inhalation if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If this program cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of the project will materialize as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.  In connection with our acquisition of the cicletanine assets from Navitas, we recorded IPR&D expense of $10.9 million during the three months ended June 30, 2008. As we do not consider the acquisition to be a material purchase, we have not made further disclosures regarding the related purchased IPR&D.  Interest and Other Income, net  Interest and other income, net, was $14.0 million and $36.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, a decrease of $13.7 million and $14.1 million from the same periods in 2007, respectively. The decrease for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 compared to the same periods in 2007 was due primarily to lower foreign currency exchange gains compared to the prior year. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2008 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2007 was partially offset by increased interest and other income driven primarily by higher average cash and investment balances.  Provision for Income Taxes  Our income tax rate was 28.4% and 28.2% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, compared to 28.5% and 29.2% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively. Our provision for     23    Table of Contents  income taxes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 was $175.7 million and $369.1 million, respectively, compared to $162.3 million and $335.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively. The tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to certain earnings from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be permanently reinvested.  Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, mergers and acquisitions, changes in accounting standards, future levels of capital expenditures, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings and finalization of federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above-mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activity (in thousands):                    As ofJune 30,2008     As ofDecember 31,2007     Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities   $ 2,908,352     $ 2,722,422     Working capital   $ 1,218,043     $ 2,292,017           Six Months EndedJune 30,        2008     2007     Cash provided by (used in):             Operating activities   $ 1,003,412     $ 1,002,214     Investing activities   $ (98,316 )   $ (771,753 )   Financing activities   $ (710,023 )   $ (336,788 )  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.91 billion at June 30, 2008, an increase of $185.9 million or 7% from December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to:        •    net cash provided by operations of $1.00 billion; and        •    proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans of $135.6 million.  These increases were offset by our repurchases of $965.8 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program during the first six months of 2008.  Working Capital  Working capital was $1.22 billion at June 30, 2008, a decrease of $1.07 billion from December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily attributable to:        •    the $1.30 billion reclassification of our convertible senior notes from long-term liabilities to current liabilities; and    24    Table of Contents     •    a $315.9 million increase in accounts payable due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz from BMS at BMS’s approximate market value of Sustiva.  These decreases were partially offset by:        •    an increase of $256.3 million in inventories due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz from BMS at BMS’s approximate market value of Sustiva;        •    an increase of $226.2 million in accounts receivable, net, driven primarily by increased product sales; and        •    a $175.7 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, due primarily to the net cash provided by operations and proceeds from issuances of common stock, offset by repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.  Cash Provided by Operating Activities  Cash provided by operating activities of $1.00 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2008 primarily related to net income of $939.0 million adjusted for non-cash items, such as $129.4 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans, $73.0 million of stock-based compensation expense and $112.5 million of cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. This was partially offset by $120.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises which we reclassified to cash provided by financing activities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment.  Cash provided by operating activities of $1.00 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was comprised primarily of $815.3 million in net income which was adjusted for non-cash items such as $105.1 million of stock-based compensation expense and $81.7 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans, partially offset by $68.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises.  Cash Used in Investing Activities  Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, as well as capital expenditures.  We used $98.3 million of cash in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2008, compared to $771.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2007. The decrease was due primarily to more cash being used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 to fund our stock repurchases.  Capital expenditures made in the six months ended June 30, 2008 related primarily to the expansion and upgrading of our facilities and information systems to accommodate our growth.  Cash Used in Financing Activities  Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $710.0 million, driven primarily by the $966.0 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program. The cash outflows were partially offset by $120.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises, as well as proceeds of $135.6 million that we received from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans.  Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was $336.8 million, driven primarily by the $454.9 million used to repurchase our common stock under the stock repurchase program and $99.0 million used to pay off all remaining amounts due on our term loan. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $148.5 million that we received from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans, as well as $68.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises.    25    Table of Contents As of June 30, 2008, we had $2.00 billion remaining under our stock repurchase program which expires in December 2010.  Other Information  In July and through August 7, 2008, we repurchased and retired 4,600,000 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $53.05 for an aggregate purchase price of $244.1 million through open market transactions. As of August 7, 2008, the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under our stock repurchase program which expires in December 2010 was $1.76 billion.  As of June 30, 2008, we had an uncollateralized revolving credit facility of $1.25 billion, of which there were no amounts outstanding.  On January 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) on a prospective basis for our financial assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 requires that we determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy established in SFAS 157 and describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, as follows:  Level 1 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and were used to measure the fair value of our U.S. treasury securities which are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets.  Level 2 inputs include observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs were used to measure the fair value of our municipal securities, agency securities, corporate debt securities, variable rate demand notes, asset-backed securities and derivatives relating to our foreign currency forward and option contracts.  Level 3 inputs include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the underlying asset or liability. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation. Auction rate securities were measured using Level 3 inputs. Although auction rate securities would typically be measured using Level 2 inputs as described above, the failure of auctions and the lack of market activity and liquidity experienced since the beginning of 2008 required that these securities be measured using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of our auction rate securities was determined using a discounted cash flow model that considered projected cash flows for the issuing trusts, underlying collateral and expected yields. Projected cash flows were estimated based on the underlying loan principal, bonds outstanding and payout formulas. The weighted-average life over which the cash flows were projected considered the collateral composition of the securities and related historical and projected prepayments. The discount rates applied to the discounted cash flow model were based on market conditions for comparable or similar term asset-backed securities as well as other fixed income securities adjusted for an illiquidity discount.  As of June 30, 2008, we had a total of $1.92 billion of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Of that total, approximately 93%, or $1.79 billion, of our total portfolio was measured using Level 1 or 2 inputs, while the remainder of our portfolio, or $131.3 million, was measured using Level 3 inputs. See “Part I, Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for a further discussion of our auction rate securities measured using Level 3 inputs.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is Indexed to an Entity’s     26    Table of Contents  Own Stock (EITF 07-5). EITF 07-5 provides guidance on how to determine if certain instruments (or embedded features) are considered indexed to our own stock, including instruments similar to our convertible senior notes, convertible note hedges, warrants to purchase our stock and the forward contract that we entered into as part of our accelerated share repurchase program in February 2008 and which was completed in June 2008. EITF 07-5 requires companies to use a two-step approach to evaluate an instrument’s contingent exercise provisions and settlement provisions in determining whether the instrument is considered to be indexed to its own stock and exempt from the application of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Although EITF 07-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, any outstanding instruments at the date of adoption will require a retrospective application through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of EITF 07-5 will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1). FSP APB 14-1 addresses instruments commonly referred to as Instrument C from EITF Issue No. 90-19, Convertible Bonds with Issuer Option to Settle for Cash upon Conversion, which requires the issuer to settle the principal amount in cash and the conversion spread in cash or net shares at the issuer’s option. FSP APB 14-1 requires that issuers of these instruments account for their liability and equity components separately by bifurcating the conversion option from the debt instrument, classifying the conversion option in equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and requires retrospective application to all periods presented. Early application is not permitted. We expect that the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. Based on the requirements of FSP APB 14-1, we estimate that if FSP APB 14-1 was effective for the current and comparative periods, we would have reported additional interest expense related to our Notes of approximately $13.1 million and $26.0 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, and $12.4 million and $24.4 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively.  In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 is intended to improve financial reporting of derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable financial statement users to better understand the effects of derivatives and hedging on an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The provisions of SFAS 161 are effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of SFAS 161 will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interests, changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes additional reporting requirements that identify and distinguish between the interest of the parent and the interest of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of SFAS 160 will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree in a business combination. SFAS 141R also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination, requires capitalization of     27    Table of Contents  IPR&D assets at the time of acquisition and requires the acquirer to disclose information that users may need to evaluate and understand the financial effect of the business combination. As SFAS 141R is effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date occurs in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, we do not know at this time whether SFAS 141R will have a material impact on our future Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.      ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  There have been no material changes in our market risk during the six months ended June 30, 2008 compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.  A portion of our marketable securities are held in auction rate securities. During the quarter ended March 31, 2008, we began observing the failed auctions for our auction rate securities for which the underlying assets are comprised of student loans. Most of our auction rate securities, including those subject to the failed auctions, are currently rated AAA, consistent with the high quality rating required by our investment policy, are supported by the federal government as part of the Federal Family Education Loan Program, and are over-collateralized. Our auction rate securities reset every seven to 35 days with maturity dates ranging from 2023 through 2041 and have interest rates ranging up to 5.4%. At June 30, 2008, our auction rate securities continued to earn interest.  If auctions continue to fail for securities in which we have invested, we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par, should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities. However, we believe that, based on our total cash and marketable securities position, our expected operating cash flows as well as access to funds through our credit facility, we are able to hold these securities until there is a recovery in the auction market and the related securities, which may be at final maturity. As a result, we do not anticipate that the current illiquidity of these auction rate securities will have a material effect on our cash requirements or working capital.      ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  An evaluation as of June 30, 2008 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules as controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at June 30, 2008.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2008, and has concluded that there was no change during such quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    28    Table of Contents Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met and, as set forth above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were sufficiently effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system were met.      PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  Information pertaining to legal proceedings can be found in “Part I. Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies” to the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and is incorporated by reference herein.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risk factors and therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.  A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales of a limited number of products. If we are unable to maintain or continue increasing sales of our HIV products, our results of operations may be adversely affected.  We are currently dependent on sales of our products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, especially Truvada and Atripla, to support our existing operations. Our HIV products contain tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and/or emtricitabine, which belong to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. Were the treatment paradigm for HIV to change, causing nucleoside-based therapeutics to fall out of favor, or if we were unable to continue increasing our HIV product sales, our results of operations would likely suffer and we would likely need to scale back our operations, including our spending on research and development (R&D) efforts. HIV product sales for the second quarter of 2008 were $1.03 billion, or 81% of our total revenues, and sales of Truvada and Atripla accounted for 50% and 34%, respectively, of our total HIV product sales during the second quarter of 2008. We may not be able to continue the growth rate of sales of our HIV products for the reasons stated in this risk factor section and, in particular, for the following reasons:        •    As our HIV products are used over a longer period of time in many patients and in combination with other products, and additional studies are conducted, new issues with respect to safety, resistance and interactions with other drugs may arise, which could cause us to provide additional warnings or contraindications on our labels, narrow our approved indications or halt sales of a product, each of which could reduce our revenues.        •    As our HIV products mature, private insurers and government reimbursers often reduce the amount they will reimburse patients for these products, which increases pressure on us to reduce prices.        •    A large part of the market for our HIV products consists of patients who are already taking other HIV drugs. If we are not successful in encouraging physicians to change patients’ regimens to include our HIV products, the sales of our HIV products will be limited.    29    Table of Contents     •    As generic HIV products are introduced into major markets, our ability to maintain pricing may be affected.  A portion of our pre-tax income is derived from royalty revenue recognized from sales of Tamiflu by Roche. As sales of Tamiflu decrease, our pre-tax income will be disproportionately affected.  F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu worldwide for the treatment and prevention of influenza under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. We recognized $37.5 million in royalty revenue in the second quarter of 2008 related to royalties received from first quarter 2008 sales of Tamiflu by Roche. Although such royalty revenue represented less than 3% of our total revenues in the second quarter of 2008, it represented 6% of our pre-tax income during the period. Roche’s Tamiflu sales have unpredictable variability due to their strong relationship with global pandemic planning efforts. Sales of Tamiflu declined sharply in the second half of 2007 due to the fulfillment of most of the existing pandemic stockpiling orders from governments and corporations. Roche reported in January 2008, April 2008 and July 2008 that it expects a significant decrease in Tamiflu sales in 2008. As sales of Tamiflu decrease, our royalty revenues will decrease and our pre-tax income will decrease disproportionately. Any such decrease could be material and could adversely impact our operating results.  Our inability to accurately estimate demand for our products, as well as sales fluctuations as a result of inventory levels held by wholesalers, pharmacies and non-retail customers make it difficult for us to accurately forecast sales and may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our financial results and our stock price.  During the six months ended June 30, 2008, approximately 91% of our product sales in the United States were to three wholesalers, Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corp. and AmerisourceBergen Corp. Inventory levels held by those wholesalers can cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to wholesalers do not match end user demand. The U.S. wholesalers with whom we have entered into inventory management agreements may not be completely effective in matching inventory levels to end user demand, as they make estimates to determine end user demand. The non-retail sector in the United States, which includes government institutions, including state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP), correctional facilities and large health maintenance organizations, tends to be less consistent in terms of buying patterns, and often causes quarter over quarter fluctuations that do not necessarily mirror the purchasing patterns that can be seen of the retail sector. For example, in the first quarter of 2008, we observed large non-retail purchases by a small number of state ADAPs that purchase centrally and have significant warehousing capacity. We believe such purchases were driven by the grant cycle for federal ADAP funds rather than current patient demand, which tempered orders and our associated product sales, revenues and earnings in the second quarter of 2008 as these organizations depleted their increased inventory levels established during the first quarter of 2008. We expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the purchasing patterns of our non-retail customers which may result in similar fluctuations in our product sales, revenues and earnings in the future.  We estimate the future demand for our products, consider the shelf life of our inventory and regularly review the realizability of our inventory. If actual demand is less than our estimated demand, we could be required to record inventory write-downs, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations.  If we fail to commercialize new products or expand the indications for existing products, our prospects for future revenues may be adversely affected.  If we do not introduce new products or increase revenues from our existing products, we will not be able to increase or maintain our total revenues. Each new product commercialization effort, including Letairis for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which we launched in the United States in June 2007, will face the risks outlined in this section. If we fail to increase sales of our products or bring new products to market, we may not be able to increase revenues and expand our R&D efforts. The marketing authorization applications submitted by us for aztreonam lysine for inhalation for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in the United States     30    Table of Contents  and the European Union or the marketing authorization application submitted by us for Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in the United States may not be granted under the timelines currently anticipated, or at all. For example, the director of the Office of New Drugs at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced in early 2008 that the FDA expects its ability to meet certain drug approval timelines (PDUFA Dates) to decrease and has notified some companies that its review of their drug applications has been delayed. Although we have not received any indication from the FDA that it will be unable to meet currently announced PDUFA Dates for aztreonam lysine for inhalation for the treatment of CF or Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, there is a risk that approval of these products, or any other products for which we seek approval, may be significantly delayed. Any such delay could negatively impact our commercialization efforts for these products.  Further, in December 2007, the Committee for Medicinal Product for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) granted marketing authorization for Atripla in the European Union for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults with virologic suppression to HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 50 copies/mL on their current combination antiretroviral therapy for more than three months. Patients must not have experienced virological failure on any prior antiretroviral therapy and must be known not to have harbored virus strains with mutations conferring significant resistance to any of the three components contained in Atripla. This restriction of Atripla’s use in the European Union will prevent us from promoting Atripla for use in patients who are not currently achieving this reduction in viral load through the use of antiretroviral therapy, including newly diagnosed patients. If we seek to expand the indication for Atripla in the European Union, the EMEA may require us to perform additional clinical trials, which we may be unable to complete. If we are unable to expand the indication for Atripla to include a broader population of patients, the impact to future sales of Atripla in the European Union is unknown but could be more limited than in other markets, including the United States, where we have no such restrictions. In addition, sales of Atripla may increase at the expense of product sales of its component products and our overall total revenues may not increase as Atripla sales increase.  We face numerous risks and uncertainties with our product candidates, including elvitegravir, our novel HIV integrase inhibitor and darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension, both currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, that could prevent completion of development of these product candidates. These risks include our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials, the need to modify or delay our clinical trials or to perform additional trials and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. As a result, our product candidates may never be successfully commercialized. Further, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of our product candidates if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If these programs and others in our pipeline cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted.  We face significant competition.  We face significant competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, most of whom have substantially greater resources than we do. In addition, our competitors have more products and have operated in the fields in which we compete for longer than we have. Our HIV products compete primarily with products from GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK), which markets fixed-dose combination products that compete with Truvada and Atripla. For Hepsera, we have encountered increased competition with Baraclude (entecavir) from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) and Tyzeka/Sebivo (telbivudine) from Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Novartis) in the United States, the European Union and China. For AmBisome, we compete primarily with products produced by Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) and Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer). In addition, we are aware of at least three lipid formulations that claim similarity to AmBisome becoming available outside of the United States, including the possible entry of one such formulation in Greece. These formulations may reduce market demand for AmBisome. Furthermore, the manufacture of lipid formulations of amphotericin B is very complex and if any of these formulations are found to be unsafe, sales of AmBisome may be negatively impacted by association. Letairis competes directly with Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc.’s Tracleer (bosentan) and     31    Table of Contents  indirectly with PAH products from United Therapeutics Corporation and Pfizer. Tamiflu competes with Relenza (zanamivir) sold by GSK and generic competitors, including amantadine and rimantadine. In addition, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing injectable formulations of peramivir, an influenza neuraminidase inhibitor, which is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials, and, if approved, would compete with Tamiflu. Aztreonam lysine for inhalation for the treatment of CF, if approved for marketing, will compete with TOBI (tobramycin for inhalation) marketed by Novartis. Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, if approved for marketing, will compete with Hepsera, our current product for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, as well as Baraclude from BMS and Tyzeka/Sebivo from Novartis.  If significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates, our future sales may be reduced, which would adversely affect our results of operations.  The data supporting the marketing approvals for our products and forming the basis for the safety warnings in our product labels were obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration and, in some cases, from post-approval use. As our products are used over longer periods of time by many patients with underlying health problems, taking numerous other medicines, we expect to continue to find new issues such as safety, resistance or drug interaction issues, which may require us to provide additional warnings or contraindications on our labels or narrow our approved indications, each of which could reduce the market acceptance of these products. If serious safety, resistance or interaction issues arise with our marketed products, sales of these products could be limited or halted by us or by regulatory authorities.  Our product Letairis, which was approved by the FDA in June 2007, is a member of a class of compounds called endothelin receptor antagonists which pose specific risks, including serious risks of liver injury and birth defects. Because of these risks, Letairis is available only through the Letairis Education and Access Program (LEAP), a restricted distribution program intended to help physicians and patients learn about the risks associated with the product and assure appropriate use of the product. As the product is used by additional patients, we may discover new risks associated with Letairis which may result in changes to the distribution program and additional restrictions on the use of Letairis which may decrease demand for the product. For example, since the launch of Letairis, cases of edema in certain patients taking Letairis have been reported. This information has recently been added to the product label, which may negatively impact demand for the product. If serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues arise with Letairis, sales of Letairis could be limited or halted by us or by regulatory authorities.  Our operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to achieve continued compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products.  The products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We are continuing clinical trials for Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva, AmBisome and Letairis for currently approved and additional uses. We anticipate that we will file for marketing approval in additional countries and for additional products over the next several years. These products may fail to receive such marketing approvals on a timely basis, or at all.  In addition, our marketed products and how we manufacture and sell these products are subject to extensive regulation and review. Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing or promotional activities may result in restrictions on our products, including withdrawal of the products from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we could be subject to penalties including fines, suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products and criminal prosecution.    32    Table of Contents On September 27, 2007, President Bush signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA), which significantly expanded the FDA’s authority, including, among other things, to:        •    require sponsors of marketed products to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk;        •    mandate labeling changes to products, at any point in a product’s lifecycle, based on new safety information; and        •    require sponsors to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for a product which could include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to healthcare providers or other elements as the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the drug, which could include imposing certain restrictions on distribution or use of a product.  Failure to comply with these or other requirements, if imposed on a sponsor by the FDA, could result in significant civil monetary penalties.  The results and anticipated timelines of our clinical trials are uncertain and may not support continued development of a product pipeline, which would adversely affect our prospects for future revenue growth.  We are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of products that we develop for each intended use through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials. The results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. Even successfully completed large-scale clinical trials may not result in marketable products. If any of our product candidates fails to achieve its primary endpoint in clinical trials, if safety issues arise or if the results of our clinical trials are otherwise inadequate to support regulatory approval of our product candidates, commercialization of that product candidate could be delayed or halted. We may also face challenges in clinical trial protocol design. If the clinical trials for any of the product candidates in our pipeline are delayed or terminated, our prospects for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted. In addition, clinical trials involving our commercial products could raise new safety issues for our existing products, which could in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business.  Due to our reliance on third-party contract research organizations to conduct our clinical trials, we are unable to directly control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials.  We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. We rely on independent third-party contract research organizations (CROs), over which we do not have control, to perform most of our clinical studies, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, program management and bioanalytical analysis. If there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our CROs, our clinical trials may be delayed. Moreover, in our regulatory submissions, we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third-party CROs. If any of our CROs’ processes, methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or inadequate, our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals could be adversely impacted. In February 2007, we were advised by the FDA that it discovered certain irregularities during its inspection of bioanalytical analyses conducted for various organizations by one of our third-party CROs. During the period under review, the CRO performed bioanalytical analyses in studies for certain of our products. In February 2008, we received correspondence from the FDA requesting that we verify results obtained by the CRO for certain studies through the conduct of an audit. If the results of an audit prove unsatisfactory, the FDA may request that we repeat the affected clinical pharmacology studies. We are evaluating the action requested by the FDA and the impact of the studies on the product label. If we do not satisfactorily address the FDA’s concerns, we may be required to remove certain of the relevant clinical pharmacology data contained in the product label, which may negatively impact demand for certain of our products.    33    Table of Contents Manufacturing problems could delay product shipments and regulatory approvals, which may adversely affect our results of operations.  We depend on third parties to perform manufacturing activities effectively and on a timely basis for Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva, Letairis and Vistide. In addition, Roche, either by itself or through third parties, is responsible for manufacturing Tamiflu. The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. We and third-party manufacturers are subject to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record-keeping and quality standards. Similar regulations are in effect in other countries. Our manufacturing operations are also subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies. Additionally, these third-party manufacturers are independent entities who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks which are out of our control. If we or any of these third-party manufacturers fail to perform as required, this could impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis or receive royalties or cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. To the extent these risks materialize and affect their performance obligations to us, our financial results may be adversely affected.  Our ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize aztreonam lysine for inhalation, if approved, will depend upon our ability to manufacture in a multi-product facility.  Aztreonam lysine is a mono-bactam Gram-negative antibiotic that we currently plan to manufacture, by ourselves or through third parties, in multi-product manufacturing facilities. Historically, the FDA has permitted the manufacture of mono-bactams in multi-product manufacturing facilities; however, there can be no assurance that the FDA will continue to allow this practice. We do not currently have a single-product facility that can be dedicated to the manufacture of aztreonam lysine for inhalation nor have we engaged a contract manufacturer with a single-product facility for aztreonam lysine for inhalation. If the FDA prohibits the manufacture of mono-bactam antibiotics, like aztreonam lysine for inhalation, in multi-product manufacturing facilities in the future, we may not be able to procure a single-product manufacturing facility in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our commercial supplies of aztreonam lysine for inhalation and our anticipated financial results attributable to such product, if approved.  We may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, which would limit our ability to generate revenues.  We need access to certain supplies and products to conduct our clinical trials and to manufacture our products. Our inability to obtain any of these materials in a timely manner may delay our development efforts for our product candidates or limit our ability to manufacture our products, which would limit our ability to generate revenues.  Suppliers of key components and materials must be named in a new drug application (NDA) filed with the FDA for any product candidate for which we are seeking FDA approval, and significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required. Even after a manufacturer is qualified by the FDA, the manufacturer must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with GMP. Manufacturers are subject to regular, periodic inspections by the FDA following initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may suspend the manufacturing operations. If the manufacturing operations of any of the single suppliers for our products are suspended, we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of product to meet market demand, which would in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business.  In addition, if delivery of material from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason, we may be unable to ship certain of our products for commercial supply or to supply our products in development for clinical trials. In addition, some of our products and the materials that we utilize in our operations are made at only one facility.     34    Table of Contents  For example, we manufacture AmBisome and fill and finish Macugen exclusively at our facilities in San Dimas, California. In the event of a natural disaster, including an earthquake, equipment failure, strike or other difficulty, we may be unable to replace this manufacturing capacity in a timely manner and may be unable to manufacture AmBisome and Macugen to meet market needs.  Our product candidate, aztreonam lysine for inhalation, which is pending FDA approval, is dependent on three different single-source suppliers. First, it is administered to the lungs of patients through a device that is made by a single supplier at a single site. Second, the FDA recently approved our facilities in San Dimas to manufacture aztreonam lysine for inhalation, subject to FDA approval of the product and device. The San Dimas facility is the only manufacturing site authorized to manufacture aztreonam lysine for inhalation, although we are pursuing FDA approval of a third-party supplier. Third, the diluent for aztreonam lysine for inhalation will be manufactured by a single supplier at a single site.  In addition, we depend on a single supplier for high quality cholesterol, which is used in the manufacture of AmBisome. We also depend on single suppliers for the active pharmaceutical ingredient and for the tableting of Letairis. Problems with any of the single suppliers we depend on may negatively impact our development and commercialization efforts.  We depend on relationships with other companies for sales and marketing performance and revenues. Failure to maintain these relationships, poor performance by these companies or disputes with these other companies could negatively impact our business.  We rely on a number of significant collaborative relationships with major pharmaceutical companies for our sales and marketing performance in certain territories. These include collaborations with BMS for Atripla in the United States, Europe and Canada; Roche for Tamiflu; and GSK for ambrisentan in territories outside of the United States. In many countries, we rely on international distributors for sales of Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva and AmBisome. Some of these relationships also involve the clinical development of these products by our partners. Reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including:        •    inability to control the resources our corporate partners devote to our programs or products;        •    disputes that may arise with respect to the ownership of rights to technology developed with corporate partners;        •    disagreements with corporate partners that could cause delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of product candidates or result in litigation or arbitration;        •    contracts with our corporate partners that may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if one of these partners fails to perform;        •    corporate partners having considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional products and may pursue alternative technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors;        •    corporate partners with marketing rights that may choose to pursue competing technologies or to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our products than they do to products of their own development; and        •    distributors and corporate partners that may be unable to pay us.  Given these risks, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed or revenues from products could decline.  Under our April 2002 licensing agreement with GSK, we gave GSK the right to control clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of Hepsera in territories in Asia, Africa and Latin America. These include major markets for Hepsera, such as China, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. The success of Hepsera in     35    Table of Contents  these territories depends almost entirely on the efforts of GSK. In this regard, GSK promotes Epivir-HBV/Zeffix, a product that competes with Hepsera. Consequently, GSK’s marketing strategy for Hepsera may be influenced by its promotion of Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. We receive royalties from GSK equal to a percentage of GSK’s net sales of Hepsera as well as net sales of GSK’s Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. If GSK fails to devote sufficient resources to, or does not succeed in developing or commercializing Hepsera in its territories, our potential revenues from sales of Hepsera from these territories may be substantially reduced.  In addition, Letairis is distributed through third-party specialty pharmacies, which are pharmacies specializing in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions that may require a high level of patient education and ongoing counseling. The use of specialty pharmacies requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing, medical affairs, regulatory affairs, legal and finance organizations and involves risks, including but not limited to risks that these specialty pharmacies will:        •    not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, patient data or safety complaints;        •    not effectively sell or support Letairis;        •    not devote the resources necessary to sell Letairis in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;        •    not be able to satisfy their financial obligations to us or others; or        •    cease operations.  We also rely on a third party to administer LEAP, the restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis. This third party provides information and education to prescribers and patients on the risks of Letairis, confirms insurance coverage and investigates alternative sources of reimbursement or assistance, ensures fulfillment of the risk management requirements mandated for Letairis by the FDA and coordinates and controls dispensing to patients through the third-party specialty pharmacies. Failure of this third party or the specialty pharmacies that distribute Letairis to perform as expected may result in regulatory action from the FDA or decreased Letairis sales, either of which would harm our business.  Further, we will be dependent on the supplier of the inhalation device that delivers aztreonam lysine for inhalation, if and when regulatory approval is obtained, to distribute the device through specialty pharmacies or other distribution channels, and we will not have control over many key aspects related to the device. For example, the supplier could encounter issues with regulatory agencies related to the device or be unable to supply sufficient quantities of this device at the time of a commercial launch or following such a launch. Moreover, because this device will be subject to a separate reimbursement approval process, in the event our supplier is unable to obtain reimbursement approval or receives approval at a lower-than-expected price, sales of aztreonam lysine for inhalation may be adversely affected. Any of the previously described issues may limit or delay the commercial launch of aztreonam lysine for inhalation, which would adversely affect our financial results.  Expenses associated with clinical trials may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price.  The clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our products, as well as clinical trials we are required to conduct after approval, are very expensive. It is difficult to accurately predict or control the amount or timing of these expenses from quarter to quarter. Uneven and unexpected spending on these programs may cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.    36    Table of Contents Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to protect our patents and other intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally. We may not be able to obtain effective patents to protect our technologies from use by competitors and patents of other companies could require us to stop using or pay for the use of required technology.  Patents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to:        •    obtain patents and licenses to patent rights;        •    preserve trade secrets; and        •    operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others.  If we have a properly designed and enforceable patent, it can be more difficult for our competitors to use our technology to create competitive products and more difficult for our competitors to obtain a patent that prevents us from using technology we create. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection both in the United States and internationally and file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements in our compounds, products and technology.  We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications and rights to patents related to our compounds, products and technology, but we cannot be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents. Patent applications are confidential for at least some period of time until a patent is issued. As a result, we may not know if our competitors filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent the technology that is the subject of our patent applications. Competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our patents. In addition, if competitors file patent applications covering our technology, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or litigation to determine the right to a patent. Litigation and interference proceedings are expensive even if we are ultimately successful. In addition, from time to time, certain individuals or entities may challenge our patents. For example, in March 2007, the Public Patent Foundation filed requests for re-examination with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) challenging four of our patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which is an active ingredient in Truvada, Atripla and Viread. The PTO granted these requests in July 2007. The PTO issued non-final rejections for the four patents, which is a step common in a proceeding to initiate the re-examination process. In May and June 2008, the PTO confirmed the patentability of three of the four patents. In July 2008, the PTO confirmed the patentability of the fourth patent. Although we were successful in responding to the PTO office actions, similar organizations may still challenge our patents in foreign jurisdictions. For example, in April 2008, the Brazilian Health Ministry, citing the pending U.S. patent re-examination proceedings as grounds for rejection, requested that the Brazilian patent authority issue a decision that is not supportive of our patent application for tenofovir in Brazil. If the tenofovir patent application is rejected by the Brazilian patent authority, the Brazilian government would be free to import generic tenofovir into Brazil, which would significantly reduce our sales of HIV products in Brazil.  Patents do not cover the active ingredients in AmBisome. In addition, we do not have patent filings in China or certain other Asian countries covering all forms of adefovir dipivoxil, the active ingredient in Hepsera. Asia is a major market for therapies for hepatitis B infection, the indication for which Hepsera has been developed. Flolan’s patent and market exclusivity protection has expired. As a result, one or more generic pharmaceutical companies may launch a generic version of Flolan in the United States.  We may obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained for those products. Because patents have a limited life, which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of the patent may be limited. However, we may be able to apply for patent term extensions.    37    Table of Contents As part of the approval process of some of our products, the FDA has determined that the products would be granted an exclusivity period during which other manufacturers’ applications for approval of generic versions of our product will not be granted. Generic manufacturers often wait to challenge the patents protecting products that have been granted exclusivity until one year prior to the end of the exclusivity period. From time to time, we have received notices from manufacturers indicating that they intend to import chemical intermediates possibly for use in making our products. It is, therefore, possible that generic manufacturers are considering attempts to seek FDA approval for a similar or identical drug through an abbreviated NDA, which is the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. If our patents are subject to challenges, we may need to spend significant resources to defend such challenges and we may not be able to defend our patents successfully.  In August 2007, the PTO adopted new rules which were scheduled to become effective on November 1, 2007. In October 2007, GSK successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against implementation of these rules, and in April 2008, the court ruled in support of GSK’s challenge to the rules and obtained a permanent injunction against their implementation. The rules would have restricted the number of claims permitted in a patent application and the number of continuing patent applications that can be filed. Following the court’s ruling, the PTO filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Court of Appeals. If the PTO successfully appeals the court’s decision and the rules are implemented, we may be limited in our ability to obtain broad patent coverage for our products and product candidates and this may allow competitors to market products very similar to ours or to obtain patent coverage for closely related products.  Our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.  If we infringe the patents of others, we may be prevented from commercializing products or may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties. We may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain these licenses or alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products. For example, we are aware of a body of patents that may relate to our operation of LEAP, our restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis.  In addition, we use significant proprietary technology and rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect certain aspects of our production and other technologies. Our trade secrets may become known or independently discovered by our competitors.  A significant portion of our product sales occur outside the United States, and currency fluctuations may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price.  A significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro. We also hedge a portion of our accounts receivable balances denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a sale is recorded and the date that cash is collected. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative value of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. As the U.S. dollar appreciates against major European currencies, the amount of the favorable impact on our product sales which have resulted from the relatively weak U.S. dollar will decrease or be eliminated, resulting in lower pre-tax earnings. The net foreign currency exchange impact on our second quarter 2008 revenues and pre-tax earnings, which includes revenues and expenses generated from outside the United States, was a favorable $45.2 million and $20.7 million, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2007.    38    Table of Contents Our hedging program only hedges a portion of our total exposure and significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations within a short period of time could adversely affect our results of operations.  We face credit risks from our European customers that may adversely affect our results of operations.  Our European product sales to government-owned or supported customers in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. Our accounts receivable from government-owned or supported customers in these countries totaled approximately $549.0 million as of June 30, 2008. Historically, receivables accumulated over a period of time and were settled as large lump sum payments as government funding became available. If significant changes were to occur in the reimbursement practices of these European governments or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from these customers and our results of operations would be adversely affected.  Our product revenues and gross margin could be reduced by imports from countries where our products are available at lower prices.  Prices for our products are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country. Our sales in countries with relatively higher prices may be reduced if products can be imported into those or other countries from lower price markets. There have been cases in which other pharmaceutical products were sold at steeply discounted prices in the developing world and then re-exported to European countries where they could be re-sold at much higher prices. If this happens with our products, particularly Truvada and Viread, which we have agreed to make available at substantially reduced prices to more than 125 countries participating in our Gilead Access Program, or Atripla, which Merck distributes at substantially reduced prices to HIV-infected patients in developing countries under our August 2006 agreement, our revenues would be adversely affected. In addition, we have established partnerships with ten Indian generic manufacturers to distribute high-quality, low-cost generic versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to 95 developing world countries, including India. If generic versions of our medications under these licenses are then re-exported to the United States, Europe or other markets outside of these 95 countries, our revenues would be adversely affected.  In addition, purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively high may adversely impact our revenues and gross margin and may cause our sales to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For example, in the European Union, we are required to permit products purchased in one country to be sold in another country. Purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively high affect the inventory level held by our wholesalers and us and can cause the relative sales levels in the various countries to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and be more difficult to forecast. In addition, wholesalers may attempt to arbitrage the pricing differential between countries by purchasing excessive quantities of our products. These activities may result in fluctuating quarterly sales in certain countries which do not reflect the actual demand for our products from customers. Such quarterly fluctuations may impact our earnings, which could adversely affect our stock price. For example, during 2007, we experienced increased sales of our HIV products in France. We believe a portion of these products was being re-exported to other countries and resold at higher prices. Our sales of Truvada and Viread in France and any countries to or from which sales have been re-exported may continue to fluctuate. Although we established an order management system in France in December 2007 to manage Truvada and Viread sales to facilitate the adequate and appropriate supply of those products commensurate with market demand in France, there can be no assurance that this management system will be effective or that these re-exporting activities will not continue in France, other European countries or elsewhere, and as a result, our results of operations could be adversely affected.    39    Table of Contents In some countries, we may be required to grant compulsory licenses for our products or face generic competition for our products.  In a number of developing countries, government officials and other interested groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs for HIV infection available at low cost. Alternatively, governments in those developing countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products, thereby reducing our product sales. For example, in the past, certain offices of the government of Brazil have expressed concern over the affordability of our HIV products and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory licenses to permit the manufacture of otherwise patented products for HIV infection, including Viread. As a result of discussions with the Brazilian government, we reached agreement with the Brazilian Health Ministry in May 2006 to reduce the price of Viread in Brazil by approximately 50%. In addition, concerns over the cost and availability of Tamiflu related to a potential avian flu pandemic have generated international discussions over compulsory licensing of our Tamiflu patents. For example, the Canadian government may allow Canadian manufacturers to manufacture and export the active ingredient in Tamiflu to eligible developing and least-developed countries under Canada’s Access to Medicines Regime. Furthermore, Roche has issued voluntary licenses to permit third-party manufacturing of Tamiflu. For example, Roche has granted a sublicense to Shanghai Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. for China and a sublicense to India’s Hetero Drugs Limited for India and certain developing countries. Should one or more compulsory licenses be issued permitting generic manufacturing to override our Tamiflu patents, or should Roche issue additional voluntary licenses to permit third-party manufacturing of Tamiflu, those developments could reduce royalties we receive from Roche’s sales of Tamiflu. Certain countries do not permit enforcement of our patents, and manufacturers are able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries. Compulsory licenses or sales of generic versions of our products could significantly reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if generic versions of our products are imported into territories where we have existing commercial sales.  Our existing products are subject to reimbursement from government agencies and other third parties. Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressures may reduce profitability.  Successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of governmental and third-party payor reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement. Government authorities and third-party payors increasingly are challenging the price of medical products and services, particularly for innovative new products and therapies. This has resulted in lower average sales prices. For example, a majority of our sales of Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera, AmBisome, Vistide and Letairis are subject to reimbursement by government agencies, resulting in significant discounts from list price and rebate obligations. Our business may be adversely affected by an increase in pricing pressures in the United States and internationally. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and health care reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.  In Europe, the success of Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva, AmBisome, Tamiflu and Volibris also depends largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because in many European countries, patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In addition, negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization by 12 months or more. We also expect that the success of our product candidates, particularly in Europe, will depend on our ability to obtain reimbursement for these product candidates if approved and commercialized. Even if reimbursement is available, reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. For example, in Europe as in many international markets, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals and expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as volumes increase. As new drugs come to market, we may face significant price decreases for our products across most of the European countries. We believe that this will continue into the foreseeable future as governments struggle with escalating health care spending. As a result of these pricing practices, it may become difficult to maintain our historic levels of profitability or to achieve expected rates of growth.    40    Table of Contents Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future health care reforms.  Legislative and regulatory changes to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. There have been significant changes to the federal Medicare system in recent years in the United States that could impact the pricing of our products. Under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, Medicare beneficiaries are now able to elect coverage for prescription drugs under Medicare Part D. The prescription drug program began on January 1, 2006 and although we have benefited initially from patients transitioning from Medicaid to Medicare Part D in 2006, the longer term impact of this new law on our business is not yet clear to us, and the impact will depend in part on specific decisions regarding the level of coverage provided for the therapeutic categories in which our products are included, the terms on which such coverage is provided, and the extent to which preference is given to selected products in a category. Some of the entities providing Medicare Part D coverage have attempted to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, discussions are taking place at the federal level to pass legislation that would either allow or require the federal government to directly negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. The increasing pressure to lower prescription drug prices may limit drug access for Medicare Part D enrollees. Further, Medicare patients will have to pay co-insurance, which may influence which products are recommended by physicians and selected by patients. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the reimbursement changes emerging from the Medicare prescription drug coverage legislation. In addition to federal Medicare proposals, state Medicaid drug payment changes could also lower payment for our products. To the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow Medicaid coverage and payment developments, the adverse effects may be magnified by private insurers adopting lower payment schedules. Additionally, health care reform at both the federal and state levels could adversely affect payment for our drugs. At this time, a few states have already enacted health care reform legislation.  We may face significant liability resulting from our products that may not be covered by insurance and successful claims could materially reduce our earnings.   The testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our commercial products, as well as product candidates in development, involve substantial risk of product liability claims. These claims may be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others. In recent years, coverage and availability of product liability insurance has decreased. In addition, the cost to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims may exceed our coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate coverage or if claims exceed our coverage, our financial condition and our ability to clinically test our product candidates and to market our products will be adversely impacted. In addition, negative publicity associated with any claims, regardless of their merit, may impair our financial condition and future demand for our products.  Our assumptions used to determine our self-insurance levels could be wrong and materially impact our business.  We continually evaluate our levels of self-insurance based on historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. However, if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends, our results of operations, business, cash flow and financial condition could be materially impacted by claims and other expenses.  Expensive litigation and government investigations may reduce our earnings.  We, along with certain of our officers and a former officer, were named as defendants in a class action lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws, which lawsuit has been dismissed by the court. However, the plaintiffs in this class action have appealed the dismissal.  In addition, in November 2006, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Francisco requesting documents regarding our marketing and medical education programs for Truvada, Viread and  Emtriva. We have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with any related governmental inquiry. The     41    Table of Contents  outcome of the class action lawsuit, any other lawsuits brought against us, the investigation or any other such investigations brought against us, are inherently uncertain, and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant expenses, monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us that could significantly reduce our earnings and cash flows and harm our business.  Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.  Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, mergers and acquisitions, changes in accounting standards, future levels of capital expenditures, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings and finalization of federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above-mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income.  Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2003 and 2004 tax years, by the Franchise Tax Board of California for the 2004 and 2005 tax years, and by various other state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Adverse resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.  Changes in accounting may affect our financial position and results of operations.  U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and related implementation guidelines and interpretations can be highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation, the adoption of new pronouncements or the application of existing pronouncements to changes in our business could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations.  For example, in May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1). FSP APB 14-1 addresses instruments commonly referred to as Instrument C from EITF 90-19, which requires the issuer to settle the principal amount in cash and the conversion spread in cash or net shares at the issuer’s option. FSP APB 14-1 requires that issuers of these instruments account for their liability and equity components separately by bifurcating the conversion option from the debt instrument, classifying the conversion option in equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and requires retrospective application to all periods presented. Early application is not permitted. We expect that the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. Based on the requirements of FSP APB 14-1, we estimate that if FSP APB 14-1 was effective for the current and comparative periods, we would have reported additional interest expense related to our convertible senior notes of approximately $13.1 million and $26.0 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, and $12.4 million and $24.4 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively.  In addition, in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree in a business combination. SFAS 141R also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination, requires capitalization of purchased in-process research and development assets at the time of acquisition and requires the acquirer to disclose information that users may need to evaluate and understand the financial effect     42    Table of Contents  of the business combination. As SFAS 141R is effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date occurs in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, we do not know at this time whether SFAS 141R will have a material impact on our future Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  If we fail to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop new product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates.  Our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, governmental regulation and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense, and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms. If we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts, our business may be harmed.    43    Table of Contents   ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
