Item 1A. Risk Factors”) included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars.Management OverviewGilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we or us), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and investigational drug candidate, we strive to transform and simplify care for people with life-threatening illnesses around the world. Gilead's primary areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, oncology and inflammation, and serious cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North and South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. We continue to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through a product acquisition and in-licensing strategy.Our portfolio of marketed products includes Sovaldi®, Stribild®, Complera®/Eviplera®, Atripla®, Truvada®, Viread®, Vitekta®, Tybost®, Zydelig®, Hepsera®, Emtriva®, Letairis®, Ranexa®, AmBisome®, Cayston® and Tamiflu®. We have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in North and South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. We also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements.Business HighlightsDuring the second quarter of 2014, we continued to advance our product pipeline across our therapeutic areas. Announcements made during the quarter include:Antiviral Program•Submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for approval of sofosbuvir (SOF), a once-daily nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. If approved, SOF would form the basis of the first all-oral, interferon-free treatment regimen for genotype 2 patients in Japan.•Positive results from a Phase 3 clinical trial in Japan evaluating the investigational once-daily fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir (LDV), our NS5A inhibitor, and SOF (LDV/SOF), with and without ribavirin (RBV), for the treatment of 26genotype 1 chronic HCV infection. Based on these data, we plan to submit an NDA for the fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF with the Japanese PMDA by the end of 2014.•U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acceptance of our refiling of two NDAs for cobicistat and elvitegravir. The FDA set target review dates under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of October 3, 2014 for cobicistat and October 4, 2014 for elvitegravir.•Presentations of data on SOF-based regimens in chronic HCV patients included:◦Positive data from two Phase 2 studies and a compassionate access study in which a regimen containing Sovaldi was administered for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in patients with advanced liver disease. ◦Positive data from two Phase 2 studies, evaluating investigational all-oral regimens containing SOF for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. ◦Positive results from an open-label clinical trial, evaluating Sovaldi for the retreatment of chronic HCV infection among patients who failed prior therapy. •Priority review granted by the FDA of the NDA for a once-daily fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection in adults. The FDA set a target review date under PDUFA of October 10, 2014.Oncology Program•Approval by the FDA of Zydelig (idelalisib) for the treatment of three B-cell blood cancers. Zydelig is indicated in combination with rituximab for patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) for whom rituximab alone would be considered appropriate therapy and as monotherapy for patients with relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. •Updated interim results of a Phase 2 study evaluating GS-9973, our investigational oral inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), for the treatment of patients with relapsed CLL. Based on these data, we plan to initiate new CLL study cohorts to include patients who have relapsed following treatment with other inhibitors of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway. Financial Highlights During the second quarter of 2014, total revenues increased to $6.53 billion, compared to $2.77 billion in the second quarter of 2013, driven primarily by the launch of Sovaldi. Sales of Sovaldi were $3.48 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Sovaldi was approved in the United States in December 2013 and in the European Union in January 2014. Since its launch, we estimate approximately 80,000 patients in the United States and Europe have begun treatment for HCV with Sovaldi.Research and development (R&D) expenses increased 11% to $583.9 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 due to increases in headcount and other costs to support expansion of our R&D activities. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 51% to $613.6 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 due to increases in headcount and other costs to support our business expansion related to Sovaldi and pre-launch activities for Zydelig and our fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF.Net income attributable to Gilead for the second quarter of 2014 increased to $3.66 billion or $2.20 per diluted share, compared to the same period in 2013, due primarily to the launch of Sovaldi, partially offset by the increase in R&D and SG&A expenses.As of June 30, 2014, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $9.58 billion, an increase of $2.72 billion compared to March 31, 2014. During the second quarter of 2014, we generated $4.19 billion of operating cash flows, which reflected strong accounts receivable collections in the quarter and included a larger than normal component related to first quarter sales given the launch of Sovaldi. We also repurchased $1.20 billion of common stock and repaid $309.7 million in debt, net of convertible note hedges.As of June 30, 2014, we had $1.70 billion remaining in our $5.00 billion stock repurchase program announced in January 2011 (2011 Program), which is expected to be completed by September 2014. In May 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to $5.00 billion of our common stock. 27Results of Operations Total Revenues Total revenues include product sales and royalty, contract and other revenues. Total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2014 were $6.53 billion, compared to $2.77 billion for the same period in 2013. Total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2014 were $11.53 billion, compared to $5.30 billion for the same period in 2013. Increases in total revenues for both periods were driven by growth in product sales resulting primarily from the launch of Sovaldi. Product SalesTotal product sales were $6.41 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of 141% compared to the same period in 2013. Total product sales were $11.28 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of 123% compared to the same period in 2013. Increases in product sales for both periods were driven by increases in antiviral and cardiovascular product sales. Antiviral product sales, including Sovaldi, totaled $6.01 billion and $10.52 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of 160% and 140%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013. Cardiovascular product sales, which include Letairis and Ranexa, totaled $266.7 million and $501.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of 14% and 12%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, approximately 25% of our product sales were generated outside of the United States and as a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in Euro. We used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had a favorable impact of $37.8 million and $32.7 million on our product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013. Product sales in the United States increased by 195% to $4.82 billion and 178% to $8.45 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013, due primarily to sales of Sovaldi, which launched in December 2013, and increases in sales of Stribild and Complera. Product sales in Europe increased by 60% to $1.31 billion and 42% to $2.33 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013, due primarily to sales of Sovaldi, which launched in January 2014, and increases in sales of Stribild and Eviplera. In light of the continued fiscal and debt crises experienced by several countries in the European Union, several governments have announced or implemented measures to manage healthcare expenditures. We continue to experience pricing pressure such as increases in the amount of discounts required on our products and delayed reimbursement which could negatively impact our future product sales and results of operations. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had a favorable impact of $45.3 million and $44.0 million on our European product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013.

The increase in the six months ended June 30, 2014 was partially offset by a decrease in wholesaler and sub-wholesaler inventories in the United States associated primarily with our HIV products. Following is additional discussion of our results by product:•SovaldiFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, sales of Sovaldi were $3.48 billion and $5.75 billion, respectively. Sovaldi sales accounted for 58% and 55% of our total antiviral product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014. Sovaldi sales in the United States were $3.03 billion and $5.13 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014. Sovaldi sales in Europe were $400.2 million and $563.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014. Since its launch in December 2013, we estimate approximately 80,000 patients in the United States and Europe have begun treatment for HCV with Sovaldi. While Sovaldi has regulatory approval in the European Union, pricing and reimbursement is obtained on a country-by-country process, with some countries completing the process more quickly than others. We currently have approved reimbursement in Germany, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark. We also sell Sovaldi in France under the Temporary Authorisations for Use Program.While we believe the sales of Sovaldi for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 are indicative of significant unmet medical need, current period results may not be indicative of future results. Future results are difficult to estimate as demand will depend on a number of factors. For example, we have submitted marketing applications for a once-daily fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF for the treatment of HCV. Doctors may choose to wait to treat their genotype 1 HCV-infected patients until the approval of the fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF or another competitor’s all-oral regimen. Also, pricing pressures could influence private and public payers' decisions to list Sovaldi on formulary or limit the types of patients for whom coverage will be provided, thus impacting future demand for Sovaldi. Product sales related to LDV/SOF in the table above for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 represent early access sales in Europe as part of a compassionate use program, as the drug is not yet commercially approved. In the United States, the FDA has set a target review date under PDUFA of October 10, 2014 for the fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF.•AtriplaAtripla sales accounted for 14% and 16% of our total antiviral product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, and decreased by 7% and 9% compared to the same periods in 2013, due primarily to declines in volume as doctors prescribed newer treatments such as Complera/Eviplera and Stribild to patients. The decline for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was also due to declines in wholesaler and sub-wholesaler inventories in the United States. The efavirenz component of Atripla, which has a gross margin of zero, comprised $318.4 million and $600.9 million of our Atripla sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, the efavirenz component of Atripla comprised $352.1 million and $680.2 million of our Atripla sales. A generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's Sustiva (efavirenz), a component of our Atripla, was made available in Canada and Europe during 2013 and will be made available in the United States in 2015. As a result, while we have observed some pricing pressure related to the Sustiva component of our Atripla sales, we have not yet observed any meaningful splitting of the Atripla single tablet regimen.•TruvadaTruvada sales accounted for 13% and 15% of our total antiviral product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively. Truvada sales remained relatively flat for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 and increased by 4% for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013, due primarily to an increase in the average net selling price during the first quarter of 2014. •Complera/EvipleraComplera/Eviplera sales increased by 59% and 63% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013, due primarily to increased sales volume in Europe and the United States. Complera/Eviplera was approved in the United States in August 2011 and in Europe in November 2011.•StribildSales of Stribild increased by 171% and 153% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013, due primarily to increased sales volume in the United States and Europe. Stribild was approved in the United States in August 2012 and in Europe in May 2013.29Cardiovascular ProductsCardiovascular product sales, which include Letairis and Ranexa, increased 14% and 12% during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, sales of Letairis increased by 13% and 9% compared to the same periods in 2013 due primarily to increased sales volume. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, sales of Ranexa increased by 14% and 15% compared to the same periods in 2013 due to an increase in the average net selling price during the first quarter of 2014 and increased sales volume.Royalty, Contract and Other RevenuesThe following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty, contract and other revenues:   Three Months Ended   Six Months Ended    June 30,   June 30,  (In thousands, except percentages) 2014 2013 Change 2014 2013 ChangeRoyalty, contract and other revenues $122,006 $110,109 11% $249,988 $248,176 1%Royalty, contract and other revenues increased by 11% and 1% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013, due primarily to higher royalty revenues from GlaxoSmithKline, Inc. and Japan Tobacco Inc. as well as seasonality in the royalty revenues from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd for Tamiflu. The majority of our royalties are recognized in the quarter following the quarter in which the corresponding product sales occur.Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross MarginThe following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales, cost of goods sold and product gross margin:   Three Months Ended   Six Months Ended    June 30,   June 30,  (In thousands, except percentages) 2014 2013 Change 2014 2013 ChangeTotal product sales $6,412,937 $2,657,285 141% $11,283,911 $5,050,853 123%Cost of goods sold $924,709 $684,663 35% $1,737,914 $1,319,111 32%Product gross margin 86% 74%   85% 74%  Product gross margins were 86% and 85% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared to 74% for the same periods in 2013. The increases were driven primarily by sales of Sovaldi which impacted product mix, partially offset by amortization of the intangible asset related to sofosbuvir following the approval and commercial launch of Sovaldi.Research and Development Expenses  Three Months Ended   Six Months Ended    June 30,   June 30,  (In thousands, except percentages) 2014 2013 Change 2014 2013 ChangeResearch and development expenses $583,924 $523,902 11% $1,178,902 $1,021,534 15%We do not track total R&D expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase. However, we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business. R&D expenses summarized above consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. R&D expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2014 increased by $60.0 million or 11% compared to the same period in 2013 due primarily to an increase of $40.4 million in personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the progression of clinical study activity, primarily in oncology and HIV, geographic expansion and marketed product support.30R&D expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2014 increased by $157.4 million or 15% compared to the same period in 2013 due primarily to $84.7 million related to the progression of clinical study activity, primarily in oncology and HIV, and $82.9 million related to personnel and infrastructure expenses to support our ongoing clinical study activity, geographic expansion and marketed product support. We expect R&D expenses to increase through the second half of 2014 to support the expansion of our clinical studies in various therapeutic areas including HCV, HIV, inflammation and respiratory. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Three Months Ended   Six Months Ended    June 30,   June 30,  (In thousands, except percentages) 2014 2013 Change 2014 2013 ChangeSelling, general and administrative expenses $613,555 $404,991 51% $1,161,678 $779,287 49%SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. Expenses are primarily comprised of facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses, and other general and administrative costs.SG&A expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2014 increased by $208.6 million or 51% compared to the same period in 2013 due primarily to an increase in headcount related and other expenses of $130.4 million to support our ongoing growth, including the expansion of our business related to Sovaldi and the anticipated launches of Zydelig and our fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF.SG&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2014 increased by $382.4 million or 49% compared to the same period in 2013 due primarily to an increase in headcount related and other expenses of $244.0 million to support our ongoing growth, including the expansion of our business related to Sovaldi and the anticipated launches of Zydelig and our fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF. We expect SG&A expenses to increase through the second half of 2014 from our continued investments in these areas.Interest ExpenseInterest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2014 was $102.0 million, an increase of $24.0 million compared to the same period in 2013. Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $178.3 million, an increase of $18.5 million compared to the same period in 2013. The increases for both periods were primarily a result of the March 2014 issuance of our senior unsecured notes due in April 2019 (April 2019 Notes), April 2024 (April 2024 Notes) and April 2044 (April 2044 Notes).Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net was not significant for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. Provision for Income TaxesOur provision for income taxes was $656.6 million and $1.38 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared to $308.0 million and $530.4 million for the same periods in 2013, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 15.2% and 19.1% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared to 28.6% and 26.3% for the same periods in 2013, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2014 includes a cumulative catch up adjustment of 3.9 percentage points to the first quarter tax rate to reduce the year to date effective tax rate to 19.1%. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 were lower than the effective tax rates for the same periods in 2013 due primarily to higher earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, offset by the expiration of the federal research tax credit as of December 31, 2013 and amortization expense of the intangible asset related to sofosbuvir for which we receive no tax benefit. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested and tax credits, partially offset by state taxes, our portion of the non-tax deductible pharmaceutical excise tax and amortization expense of the intangible asset related to sofosbuvir for which we receive no tax benefit. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.31Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the periods presented: (In thousands) June 30, 2014 December 31, 2013Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $9,581,383 $2,570,590Working capital $9,271,342 $948,332  Six Months Ended  June 30,(In thousands) 2014 2013Cash provided by (used in):    Operating activities $5,753,311 $1,625,105Investing activities $(648,188) $(462,733)Financing activities $1,512,545 $(756,649)Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities As of June 30, 2014, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $9.58 billion, an increase of $7.01 billion or 273% from December 31, 2013. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we generated $5.75 billion in cash flows from operations, received $3.97 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in March 2014 and repaid $1.15 billion in debt, net of convertible note hedges. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we also repurchased $1.65 billion of common stock.Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at June 30, 2014, approximately $3.76 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. We do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity in the United States to fund our domestic operational and strategic needs.Working CapitalWorking capital was $9.27 billion at June 30, 2014. The increase of $8.32 billion in working capital from December 31, 2013 was driven primarily by an increase in cash and cash equivalents due to the issuance of senior unsecured notes in March 2014, an increase in accounts receivable, net, driven by increased sales and a decrease in the current portion of long-term debt, net, related to the repayment of our bank debt and conversions of our convertible senior notes.Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $5.75 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and consisted primarily of net income of $5.87 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $507.9 million of depreciation and amortization expenses. This was partially offset by $770.4 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities.Cash provided by operating activities was $1.63 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and consisted primarily of net income of $1.49 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $147.5 million of depreciation and amortization expenses and $117.7 million of stock-based compensation expenses. This was partially offset by $179.4 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $648.2 million, consisting primarily of $393.7 million in net purchases of marketable securities and $254.5 million in capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business.Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was $462.7 million, consisting primarily of $378.6 million used in our acquisition of YM BioSciences Inc., net of the cash acquired.32Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing ActivitiesCash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $1.51 billion, consisting primarily of $3.97 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of our April 2019 Notes, April 2024 Notes and April 2044 Notes, partially offset by $1.15 billion used to repay debt, net of convertible note hedges and $1.65 billion used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program.Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was $756.6 million, driven primarily by $2.14 billion used to repay debt financing which included the maturity and conversions of our convertible senior notes, partially offset by net proceeds of $1.21 billion related to our convertible note hedges and proceeds of $146.3 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans.Long-Term Obligations The following is a summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements (in thousands):Type of Borrowing Description Issue Date Due Date Interest Rate June 30, 2014 December 31, 2013Convertible Senior May 2014 Notes July 2010 May 2014 1.00% $— $234,217Convertible Senior May 2016 Notes July 2010 May 2016 1.625% 822,139 1,113,043Senior Unsecured April 2021 Notes March 2011 April 2021 4.50% 994,210 993,781Senior Unsecured December 2014 Notes December 2011 December 2014 2.40% 749,868 749,710Senior Unsecured December 2016 Notes December 2011 December 2016 3.05% 699,441 699,326Senior Unsecured December 2021 Notes December 2011 December 2021 4.40% 1,247,861 1,247,716Senior Unsecured December 2041 Notes December 2011 December 2041 5.65% 997,923 997,885Senior Unsecured April 2019 Notes March 2014 April 2019 2.05% 499,189 —Senior Unsecured April 2024 Notes March 2014 April 2024 3.70% 1,747,271 —Senior Unsecured April 2044 Notes March 2014 April 2044 4.80% 1,746,641 —Credit Facility Five-Year Revolver January 2012 January 2017 Variable — 600,000Total debt, net 9,504,543 6,635,678Less current portion 1,572,007 2,696,970Total long-term debt, net $7,932,536 $3,938,708Debt FinancingIn March 2014, we issued senior unsecured notes in a registered offering for a total aggregate principal amount of $4.00 billion. We issued the April 2019 Notes for $500.0 million which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 2.05%, the April 2024 Notes for $1.75 billion which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 3.70% and the April 2044 Notes for $1.75 billion which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.80%. We have begun using the net proceeds from this debt financing for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of debt and related payments, working capital and the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program.Convertible Senior NotesDuring the six months ended June 30, 2014, our convertible senior notes due in May 2014 (May 2014 Notes) matured and a portion of our convertible senior notes due in May 2016 (May 2016 Notes) (together, the Notes) was converted. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we repaid $553.1 million of principal balance relating to the Notes. We also paid $1.29 billion in cash related to the conversion spread of the Notes, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $1.29 billion in cash from the convertible note hedges related to the Notes.As of June 30, 2014, the May 2016 Notes were classified as current given that their conversion criteria had been met. As a result, the related unamortized discount of $35.9 million was classified as equity component of currently redeemable convertible notes on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.There are 55.5 million shares of our common stock underlying our warrants expiring in 2014 (the 2014 Warrants). The 2014 Warrants have a strike price of $28.38 per share and expire during the 40 trading-day period commencing August 1, 2014 and ending on September 26, 2014. On July 29, 2014, we exercised our option to settle the warrants in cash. As a result, during the third quarter of 2014, we expect to pay approximately $3.14 billion to $3.69 billion in cash to settle the warrants. Because the warrants could have been settled, at our option, in cash or shares of our common stock, and the related contracts met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, the settlement will be recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.33There are 55.1 million shares of our common stock underlying our warrants expiring in 2016 (the 2016 Warrants). The 2016 Warrants have a strike price of $30.05 per share and are exercisable only on their expiration date. If the market value of our common stock at the time of the exercise of the warrants exceeds their strike price, we will be required to net settle in cash or shares of our common stock, at our option, for the value of the warrants in excess of the warrant strike price.Credit FacilitiesDuring the first quarter of 2014, we repaid the remaining balance of $600.0 million that was outstanding under the revolving credit facility credit agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility credit agreement as of June 30, 2014. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit agreement and note indentures and as of June 30, 2014, we believe we were in compliance with all such covenants.Stock Repurchase ProgramUnder our 2011 Program, we repurchased a total of $1.20 billion or 15.2 million shares of common stock during the three months ended June 30, 2014, and a total of $1.65 billion or 20.9 million shares of common stock during the six months ended June 30, 2014. As of June 30, 2014, we had $1.70 billion remaining in our 2011 Program, which is expected to be completed by September 2014. In May 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to $5.00 billion of our common stock through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated transactions or other means. This new program expires three years after the completion of the 2011 Program. We intend to use the additional authorization to repurchase shares opportunistically and to offset the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans.Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and JudgmentsThere have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments during the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, jointly with the International Accounting Standards Board, issued a comprehensive new standard on revenue recognition from contracts with customers. The standard's core principle is that a reporting entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying this new guidance to contracts within its scope, an entity will: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Additionally, this new guidance will require significantly expanded revenue recognition disclosures. This guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Early application is not permitted. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this new guidance. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of this standard on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.34ITEM 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThere have been no material changes in our market risk during the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.As of June 30, 2014, our accounts receivable in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $652.4 million, of which $173.0 million were past due greater than 120 days and $53.6 million were past due greater than 365 days. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate at June 30, 2014. However, we will continue to monitor the European economic environment for collectability issues related to our outstanding receivables.ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation as of June 30, 2014 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at June 30, 2014.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2014, and has concluded that there was no change during such quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Limitations on the Effectiveness of ControlsA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met and, as set forth above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system were met.35PART II.OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Litigation Regarding Sofosbuvir In January 2012, we acquired Pharmasset, Inc. (Pharmasset). Through the acquisition, we acquired sofosbuvir, a nucleotide analog that acts to inhibit the replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). In December 2013, we received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of sofosbuvir, now known commercially as Sovaldi. We have received a number of contractual and intellectual property claims regarding sofosbuvir. We have carefully considered these claims both prior to and following the acquisition and believe they are without merit. We own patents that claim sofosbuvir as a chemical entity and its metabolites. However, the existence of patents does not necessarily guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have, or obtain rights to, patents that allegedly could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing sofosbuvir. For example, we are aware of patents and patent applications owned by other parties that may be alleged by such parties to cover the use of sofosbuvir. If these parties successfully obtain valid and enforceable patents, and successfully prove infringement of those patents by sofosbuvir, we could be prevented from selling sofosbuvir unless we were able to obtain a license under such patents. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Further, if any party is successful in establishing exclusive rights to sofosbuvir, our expected revenues and earnings from the sale of sofosbuvir would be adversely affected. Arbitration with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd and Hoffman-La Roche Inc. (collectively, Roche)Gilead (as successor to Pharmasset) is a party to an October 29, 2004 collaboration agreement with Roche. The agreement granted Roche rights to develop PSI-6130, a cytidine analog, and its prodrugs, for the treatment of HCV infection. The collaborative research efforts under the agreement ended on December 31, 2006. Roche later asked Pharmasset to consider whether Roche may have contributed to the inventorship of sofosbuvir and whether Pharmasset has complied with the confidentiality provisions of the collaboration agreement. Pharmasset advised us that it carefully considered the issues raised by Roche and that it believed any such issues are without merit. We have also considered these issues and reached the same conclusion. In March 2013, Roche initiated an arbitration against us and Pharmasset, predecessor to Gilead Pharmasset LLC, regarding the collaboration agreement. In the arbitration demand, Roche asserts that it has an exclusive license to sofosbuvir pursuant to the collaboration agreement because sofosbuvir, a prodrug of a uridine monophosphate analog, is allegedly a prodrug of PSI-6130, a cytidine analog. Roche further claims that, because it has exclusive rights to sofosbuvir, it also has an exclusive license to a patent covering sofosbuvir, and that we will infringe that patent by selling and offering for sale products containing sofosbuvir. Gilead and Gilead Pharmasset LLC filed their response to Roche's arbitration demand in April 2013. The arbitration hearing was held in New York in June 2014. We expect a decision in the arbitration by the end of 2014.Interference Proceedings and Litigation with Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Idenix)In February 2012, we received notice that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) had declared Interference No. 105,871 (First Idenix Interference) between our U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572 and Idenix's pending U.S. Patent Application No. 12/131,868. An interference is an administrative proceeding before the USPTO designed to determine who was the first to invent the subject matter claimed by both parties. Our patent covers metabolites of sofosbuvir and RG7128, a prodrug of a cytidine nucleoside analog that Pharmasset licensed to Roche. Idenix is attempting to patent a class of compounds, including these metabolites. The purpose of the First Idenix Interference was to determine who was first to invent these compounds and therefore who is entitled to the patent claiming these compounds. In March 2013, the USPTO Patent Trials and Appeal Board (the Board) determined that Idenix is not entitled to the benefit of any of its early application filing dates because none of those patent applications, including the application that led to Idenix’s U.S. Patent No. 7,608,600 (the ‘600 patent), taught how to make the compounds in dispute. The Board also determined that because we are entitled to the filing date of our earliest application, we were first to file the patent application on the compounds in dispute, and we were therefore the “senior party” in the First Idenix Interference. On January 29, 2014, the Board determined that Pharmasset and not Idenix was the first to invent the compounds in dispute and accordingly Gilead prevailed. In its decision, the Board held that Idenix failed to prove that it was first to conceive of any of the compounds in dispute. Specifically, Idenix failed to prove that the Idenix inventors had identified the structure, a method of making and a use for any of the disputed compounds. The Board went on to conclude that Idenix failed to work diligently toward making and testing the compounds in dispute during the relevant time period. Idenix has appealed the Board’s decisions to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. If either or both of the Board’s decisions are reversed on appeal and the court determines that Idenix is entitled to their patent claims, and it is determined that we have infringed those claims, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Idenix to commercialize sofosbuvir and RG7128 in the United States. A decision by the District Court can be appealed by either party to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC).36We believe the claims in the Idenix application involved in the First Idenix Interference, and similar U.S. and foreign patents claiming the same compounds and metabolites, are invalid. As a result, we filed an Impeachment Action in the Federal Court of Canada to invalidate Idenix Canadian Patent No. 2,490,191 (the ‘191 patent), which is the Canadian patent that corresponds to the ‘600 patent and the Idenix patent application that was the subject of the First Idenix Interference. Idenix has now asserted that the commercialization of Sovaldi in Canada will infringe its ‘191 patent and that our Canadian Patent No. 2,527,657, corresponding to our U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572 in the First Idenix Interference, is invalid.We filed a similar legal action in Norway in the Oslo District Court seeking to invalidate Idenix's corresponding Norwegian patent. In September 2013, Idenix filed an invalidation action in the Norwegian proceedings against our Norwegian Patent No. 333700 patent, which corresponds to our U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572 patent. The trial was held in November 2013. On March 21, 2014, the Norwegian court found all claims in the Idenix Norwegian patent to be invalid and upheld the validity of all claims in the challenged Gilead patent. Additionally, the Norwegian court ordered Idenix to pay us over $2.0 million in attorney fees as the losing party to the litigation. On April 30, 2014, Idenix appealed the March 21, 2014 decision to the Norwegian Court of Appeal. Idenix’s obligation to pay our attorneys’ fees will be stayed during the pendency of the appeal.In August 2013 and April 2014, Idenix filed two separate requests for invalidation with the Chinese Patent Office of our Chinese Patent CN ZL200480019148.4, which corresponds to our U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572 patent.We filed a legal action in the Federal Court of Australia seeking to invalidate Idenix’s Australian patent corresponding to the ‘600 patent. In April 2013, Idenix asserted that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe the Australian patent corresponding to the ‘600 patent. On March 12, 2014 the European Patent Office (EPO) granted Idenix European Patent No. 1 523 489 (the ‘489 patent), which corresponds to the ‘600 patent. The same day that the ‘489 patent granted, we filed an opposition with the EPO seeking to revoke the ‘489 patent. Also on March 12, 2014, Idenix initiated infringement proceedings against Gilead in the United Kingdom, Germany and France alleging that the commercialization of Sovaldi in those countries would infringe the respective national counterparts of the ‘489 patent. In the United Kingdom, the court has ordered an October 2014 trial date to determine the issues of infringement and validity of the Idenix United Kingdom patent. In Germany, the court in Düsseldorf has ordered a hearing date of December 2, 2014 to determine the issue of infringement of the Idenix German patent. We do not have a trial date for the French lawsuit.Idenix has not been awarded patents corresponding to the ‘600 patent in Japan or China. In the event such patents issue, we expect to challenge them in proceedings similar to those we invoked in Europe, Canada, Norway and Australia. If the courts hearing these proceedings determine that Idenix is entitled to their patent claims and it is determined that we have infringed those claims, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Idenix to commercialize sofosbuvir and RG7128 in that country.In December 2013, after receiving our request to do so, the USPTO declared Interference No. 105,981 (Second Idenix Interference) between our pending U.S. Patent Application No. 11/854,218 and the ‘600 patent. The ‘600 patent includes claims directed to methods of treating HCV with nucleoside compounds similar to those which were involved in the First Idenix Interference. The Second Idenix Interference will determine who was first to invent the claimed methods of treating HCV. In the declaration of the Second Idenix Interference, the USPTO has initially designated Gilead as the junior party based upon the patent application filing dates appearing on the face of the ‘600 patent.We believe the Board’s determination in the First Idenix Interference that Idenix is not entitled to the benefit of any of its earlier application filing dates, including the filing date of the ‘600 patent, will be equally applicable to the Second Idenix Interference. If we are correct, the Board may conclude that Gilead is the senior party in the Second Idenix Interference, consistent with the determination in the First Idenix Interference. In light of the Board’s conclusion in the First Idenix Interference that the application that led to the ‘600 patent does not teach how to make the claimed compounds, it is possible that the Board will make the same determination in the Second Idenix Interference and eliminate the need for the Board to address who was the first to invent the claimed methods of treating HCV. However, if the Board does consider who was the first to invent the claimed methods of treating HCV and ultimately concludes that Gilead was first, the claims in the ‘600 patent may be revoked. If the Board determines that Idenix was first to invent and is entitled to these patent claims, and it is determined in other proceedings that we have infringed those claims, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Idenix to commercialize sofosbuvir and RG7128. Any determination by the Board can be appealed by either party to U.S. federal court.In December 2013, Idenix, Universita Degli Studi di Cagliari (UDSG), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and L’Université Montpellier II sued us in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe the ‘600 patent and that an interference exists between the ‘600 patent and our U.S. Patent No. 8,415,322. We believe that the claims in the ‘600 patent are invalid and that we have the sole right to commercialize sofosbuvir. However, if the court disagrees with our view and further determines that the ‘600 patent is infringed, we may be required to 37obtain a license from and pay royalties to Idenix to commercialize sofosbuvir. A decision by the District Court can be appealed by either party to the CAFC.Also in December 2013, Idenix and UDSG sued us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 6,914,054 and 7,608,597. On June 30, 2014, the court in Massachusetts granted our request and transferred the Massachusetts litigation to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. We believe that Idenix’s patents are invalid and would not be infringed by our commercialization of sofosbuvir and that we have the sole right to commercialize sofosbuvir. However, if the court disagrees with our view and determines that these patents are infringed, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Idenix to commercialize sofosbuvir. A decision by the District Court can be appealed by either party to the CAFC.We have an expansive patent portfolio covering NS5A inhibitors for the treatment of HCV. Following the disclosure of the structure of Idenix’s NS5A inhibitor, samatasvir (also known as IDX-719), we are evaluating the compound in light of the claims of our granted U.S. Patent No. 8,669,234.On June 9, 2014, Merck and Idenix announced that the companies had entered into a definitive agreement under which Merck will acquire Idenix.Litigation with Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck)In August 2013, Merck contacted us requesting that we pay royalties on the sales of sofosbuvir and obtain a license to U.S. Patent Nos. 7,105,499 and 8,481,712, which it co-owns with Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We believe that Merck’s patents are invalid and would not be infringed by our commercialization of sofosbuvir and that we have the sole right to commercialize sofosbuvir. Accordingly, in August 2013, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking declaratory judgment that the Merck patents are invalid and not infringed. Merck’s U.S. Patent Nos. 7,105,499 and 8,481,712 cover compounds which do not include, but may relate to, sofosbuvir. During patent prosecution, Merck amended its patent application in an attempt to cover compounds related to sofosbuvir and ultimately extract royalty payments for sofosbuvir’s commercialization, or to exclude it from the market. If the court determines that Merck’s patents are valid and that we have infringed those claims, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Merck to commercialize sofosbuvir. Either party can appeal a decision by the District Court to the CAFC. The court has set a trial date of March 7, 2016 for this litigation. The court has set a trial date of March 7, 2016 for this litigation. While this merger does not change our view of the merits of Merck's and Idenix's claims, Merck has greater resources than Idenix and may therefore choose to fund the litigation at higher levels than Idenix.Litigation with AbbVie, Inc. (AbbVie)AbbVie has obtained U.S. Patent Nos. 8,466,159, 8,492,386, 8,680,106, and 8,685,984, which purport to claim the use of a combination of LDV/SOF for the treatment of HCV. We own published and pending patent applications directed to the use of combinations for the treatment of HCV, and, specifically, to combinations of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. Certain of those applications were filed before AbbVie’s patents. For this reason and others, we believe AbbVie’s patents are invalid.Accordingly, in December 2013, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware seeking declaratory judgment that the AbbVie patents are invalid and unenforceable, as well as other relief. We believe that Abbott Laboratories, Inc. and AbbVie conspired to eliminate competition in the HCV market by falsely representing to the USPTO that they, and not Gilead, invented methods of treating HCV using a combination of LDV/SOF. In February and March 2014, AbbVie responded to our lawsuit by filing two lawsuits also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that our fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF will infringe its patents. We do not expect AbbVie’s patents to block or delay the commercialization of our combination products. If the court determines that AbbVie’s patents are valid and that we have infringed those claims, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to AbbVie to commercialize sofosbuvir combination products. Either party can appeal a decision by the District Court to the CAFC. We are aware that AbbVie is pursuing similar patents in Europe and other countries.We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of contractual and intellectual property claims related to sofosbovir, and we may spend significant resources enforcing and defending these patents. If these parties successfully obtain valid and enforceable patents, and successfully prove infringement of those patents by sofosbuvir, we could be prevented from selling sofosbuvir unless we were able to obtain a license under such patents. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Further, if any party is successful in establishing exclusive rights to sofosbuvir, our expected revenues and earnings from the sale of sofosbuvir would be adversely affected. Litigation with Generic ManufacturersAs part of the approval process for some of our products, the FDA granted us a New Chemical Entity (NCE) exclusivity period during which other manufacturers' applications for approval of generic versions of our product will not be approved. 38Generic manufacturers may challenge the patents protecting products that have been granted NCE exclusivity one year prior to the end of the NCE exclusivity period. Generic manufacturers have sought and may continue to seek FDA approval for a similar or identical drug through an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug.Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate, Emtricitabine and Fixed-Dose Combination of Emtricitabine, Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate and EfavirenzIn 2008 and 2009, we received notices that Teva Pharmaceuticals (Teva) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Truvada. In the notices, Teva alleged that patents associated with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva's manufacture, use or sale of a generic fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In April 2013, we and Teva reached an agreement to settle the ongoing patent litigation concerning the patents that protect tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in Atripla, Truvada and Viread. Under the agreement, Teva will be allowed to launch a generic version of Viread on December 15, 2017. On October 1, 2013, the court’s dismissal of the case pursuant to the settlement agreement between the parties became final. A trial in the lawsuit against Teva related to the U.S. patents protecting emtricitabine in Atripla and Truvada was held in October 2013. In April 2014, we and Teva entered into an agreement to settle the ongoing patent litigation concerning the emtricitabine patents that protect Atripla and Truvada. In November 2011, we received notice that Teva submitted an abbreviated new drug submission (ANDS) to the Canadian Minister of Health requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In the notice, Teva alleges that three of the patents associated with Truvada are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In January 2012, we filed a lawsuit against Teva in the Federal Court of Canada seeking an order of prohibition against approval of this ANDS.In December 2011, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDS to the Canadian Minister of Health requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and efavirenz. In the notice, Teva alleges that three of our patents associated with Atripla and two of Merck's patents associated with Atripla are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva's manufacture, use or sale of a generic fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and efavirenz. In February 2012, we filed a lawsuit against Teva in the Federal Court of Canada seeking an order of prohibition against approval of this ANDS. In August 2012, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDS to the Canadian Minister of Health requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Viread. In the notice, Teva alleges that two patents associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Viread, Truvada, and Atripla. In September 2012, we filed a lawsuit against Teva in the Federal Court of Canada seeking an order of prohibition against approval of this ANDS. Also in August 2012, Teva filed an Impeachment Action in the Federal Court of Canada seeking invalidation of our two Canadian patents associated with Viread. We are currently defending that Impeachment Action. The requests for orders of prohibition in connection with all three of Teva’s ANDS filings (for Teva’s generic versions of Viread, Truvada and Atripla) were consolidated and a hearing on the consolidated requests for the orders of prohibition took place in September 2013. In December 2013, the court issued our requested order prohibiting the Canadian Ministry of Health from issuing a Notice of Compliance for Teva’s generic versions of our Viread, Truvada and Atripla products until expiry of our patent in July 2017. Teva appealed the decision of the court prohibiting the Minister of Heath from issuing the Notices of Compliance until expiry of our patent in July 2017. This decision did not rule on the validity of the patents and accordingly the only issue on appeal is whether the Minister of Health should be prohibited from issuing the Notices of Compliance for Teva’s products. Separately, the court will determine the validity of the patents in the pending Impeachment Action. A trial in the Impeachment Action is scheduled for March 2015. If Teva is successful in invalidating our patents, Teva may be able to launch generic versions of our Viread, Truvada and Atripla products in Canada prior to the expiry of our patents.In July 2012, we received notice that Lupin Limited (Lupin) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Truvada. In the notice, Lupin alleges that four patents associated with emtricitabine and four patents associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Lupin's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In August 2012, we filed two lawsuits against Lupin in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for infringement of our patents. In October 2012, we received notice that Lupin submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Viread. In the notice, Lupin alleges that four patents associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Lupin's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In October 2012, we filed a lawsuit against Lupin in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for infringement of our patents. In May 2014, Lupin amended its ANDAs to certify that it is no longer seeking approval to market generic versions of Truvada and Viread prior to the expiration of the four patents associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in January 2018 (including pediatric exclusivity). As a result, on May 3930, 2014, the NY District Court granted Gilead and Lupin's Joint Motion for Order of Dismissal in our patent infringement lawsuit against Lupin for the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate patents. The District Court has scheduled a trial in the second lawsuit concerning the emtricitabine patents for December 2014. Either party can appeal a decision by the District Court to the CAFC. If Lupin is successful in invalidating our patents, Lupin may be able to launch a generic version of our Truvada product in January 2018.In July 2012, we received notice that Cipla Ltd. (Cipla) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Emtriva and a generic version of Viread. In the notice, Cipla alleges that two patents associated with emtricitabine are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Cipla's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of emtricitabine and four patents associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Cipla's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In August 2012, we filed lawsuits against Cipla in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for infringement of our patents. In July 2014, we and Cipla reached agreement to settle those lawsuits. Terms of the settlement are confidential.Either party can appeal a decision by the District Court to the CAFC. If Lupin is successful in invalidating our patents, Lupin may be able to launch generic version of our Viread product prior to the expiry of our patents.In April 2014, we received notice that Mylan Inc. (Mylan) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Truvada. In the notice, Mylan alleges that two of the patents associated with emtricitabine and one of our patents associated with the fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Mylan's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In June 2014, we filed a lawsuit against Mylan in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia for infringement of our patents.In June 2014, we received notice that Mylan Inc. submitted petitions for Inter Partes Review (IPR) to the US Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the Board) alleging that four patents associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are invalid. We are opposing Mylan’s petitions. We anticipate that the Board will issue an initiation decision by December 2014. If the Board initiates an IPR, we anticipate a final decision by December 2015. Either party can appeal a decision of the Board to the CAFC. If Mylan is successful in invalidating our patents, generic companies will be able to launch a generic version of our Viread product prior to the expiry of our patents.RanolazineIn June 2010, we received notice that Lupin submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of sustained release ranolazine. In the notice, Lupin alleged that ten of the patents associated with Ranexa are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Lupin's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Ranexa. In July 2010, we filed a lawsuit against Lupin in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for infringement of certain Ranexa patents challenged by Lupin. The trial took place in April and May 2013. In August 2013, the parties reached agreement to settle the patent litigation prior to issuance of the court’s decision. Under the agreement, Lupin would be allowed to launch a generic version of Ranexa on February 27, 2019. TamifluIn February 2011, we received notice that Natco Pharma Ltd. (Natco) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Tamiflu. In the notice, Natco alleges that one of the patents associated with oseltamivir phosphate is invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Natco's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Tamiflu. In March 2011, we and Roche filed a lawsuit against Natco in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for infringement of one of the patents associated with Tamiflu. In December 2012, the court issued a ruling in favor of Gilead and Roche, that our patent is not invalid for the reasons stated in Natco's notice letter. Natco has appealed this decision to the CAFC. A hearing on Natco’s appeal took place in January 2014. The court issued a decision on April 22, 2014 which will allow Natco’s patent invalidity challenge to proceed if the case is remanded to the District Court of New Jersey for a full trial on the merits. On June 30, 2014, we filed a petition for rehearing en banc with the CAFC.Department of Justice InvestigationIn June 2011, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California requesting documents related to the manufacture, and related quality and distribution practices, of Complera, Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera and Letairis. We cooperated with the government’s inquiry. On April 16, 2014, the United States Department of Justice informed us that, following an investigation, it declined to intervene in a False Claims Act lawsuit filed by two former employees. We have moved to dismiss the complaint.40Other MattersWe are a party to various legal actions that arose in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that these other legal actions will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated business, financial position or results of operations. ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. A manifestation of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and, therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales of Sovaldi for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) and our antiviral products, particularly our single tablet regimen human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) products, including Atripla, Stribild and Complera/Eviplera. If we are unable to maintain or continue increasing sales of these products, our results of operations may be adversely affected.During the six months ended June 30, 2014, sales of Sovaldi for the treatment of HCV accounted for approximately 55% of our total antiviral products sales. Since this is the second full quarter following Sovaldi’s launch, we cannot be certain if these sales are indicative of future revenue. Demand for Sovaldi depends in part on the amount of patient coverage under private and public insurance programs in the United States and our ability to obtain and maintain government reimbursement in countries outside the United States. Further, pricing pressures could influence private and public payers' decisions to list Sovaldi on formulary or limit the types of patients for whom coverage will be provided, thus impacting the demand for Sovaldi. In addition, we have seen signs that some physicians have begun delaying treatment for some genotype 1 HCV-infected patients in anticipation of the approval and availability of our fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) and another competitor’s all-oral regimen for the treatment of genotype 1 HCV-infected patients. If we are unable to maintain the current or expected future sales levels of Sovaldi or obtain approval for our HCV product candidates in the currently anticipated timelines, our results of operations and stock price could be negatively impacted. We receive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products for the treatment of HIV infection, particularly our single table regimen products, including Atripla, Stribild and Complera/Eviplera. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, sales of our HIV products accounted for more than 40% of our total antiviral products sales. Most of our HIV products contain tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and/or emtricitabine, which belong to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. If the treatment paradigm for HIV changes, causing nucleoside-based therapeutics to fall out of favor, or if we are unable to maintain or continue increasing our HIV product sales, our results of operations would likely suffer and we would likely need to scale back our operations, including our spending on research and development (R&D) efforts. We may not be able to sustain or increase the growth rate of sales of our HIV products, especially Atripla, Stribild and Complera/Eviplera, for any number of reasons including, but not limited to, the following:•As our HIV products are used over a longer period of time in many patients and in combination with other products, and additional studies are conducted, new issues with respect to safety, resistance and interactions with other drugs may arise, which could cause us to provide additional warnings or contraindications on our labels, narrow our approved indications or halt sales of a product, each of which could reduce our revenues.•As our HIV products mature, private insurers and government payers often reduce the amount they will reimburse patients for these products, which increases pressure on us to reduce prices.•A large part of the market for our HIV products consists of patients who are already taking other HIV drugs. If we are not successful in encouraging physicians to change patients' regimens to include our HIV products, the sales of our HIV products will be limited.•As generic HIV products are introduced into major markets, our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected. For example, generic versions of Sustiva (efavirenz), a component of our Atripla, are now available in Canada and Europe and we expect competition from generic efavirenz in the United States in 2015. We have observed some pricing pressure related to the Sustiva component of our Atripla sales. Tivicay (dolutegravir), an integrase inhibitor, launched in the fourth quarter of 2013 by ViiV Healthcare (ViiV) could adversely impact sales of our HIV products.If we fail to commercialize new products or expand the indications for existing products, our prospects for future revenues may be adversely affected.41If we do not introduce new products to market or increase sales of our existing products, we will not be able to increase or maintain our total revenues and continue to expand our R&D efforts. Drug development is inherently risky and many product candidates fail during the drug development process. For example, in April 2013, we announced our decision to terminate our Phase 3 clinical trial of aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of bronchiectasis. In February 2014, we filed a new drug application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of the fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF for genotype 1 patients, who represent a majority of patients infected with HCV in the United States and Europe. If approved, LDV/SOF will likely only require genotype 1 HCV patients to take one pill, once per day for eight or 12 weeks without ribavirin (RBV) or pegylated interferon (peg-IFN). In February 2014, we filed our marketing application for approval of LDV/SOF in Europe and our application was validated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2014. We have also filed marketing applications for approval of idelalisib for the treatment of patients with indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (iNHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in Europe. In the first half of 2014, we also resubmitted our NDAs for elvitegravir and cobicistat, as standalone agents, for the treatment of HIV with the FDA. In June 2014, we submitted a NDA with Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for approval of sofosbuvir for the treatment of HCV. These marking applications may not be approved by the FDA, EMA, the PMDA or other foreign regulatory authorities on a timely basis, or at all. Even if marketing approval is granted for these products, there may be significant limitations on their use. Further, we may be unable to file our marketing applications for new products.Our inability to accurately estimate demand for our products, the uptake of new products or the timing of fluctuations in the inventories maintained by customers makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast sales and may cause our revenues and earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our financial results and our stock price.We are unable to accurately estimate demand for our products, including the uptake of new products, as demand is dependent on a number of factors. For example, our HCV products, Sovaldi and LDV/SOF, if approved, represent a significant change in the treatment paradigm for HCV-infected patients due to the shortened duration of treatment and the reduction or elimination of the need for peg-IFN injection and RBV. Because these products are in a new therapeutic area for us and patient demand is dependent on a number of factors, revenues from these products in 2014 and beyond are difficult for us and investors to estimate. Since Sovaldi was recently approved and it is not clear when, or if, LDV/SOF will ultimately be approved, demand for these products will depend in part on the amount of their coverage under private and public insurance programs in the United States and our ability to obtain and maintain government reimbursement in countries outside the United States. Pricing pressures could influence private and public payers' decisions to list Sovaldi on formulary or limit the types of patients for whom coverage will be provided, thus impacting the demand for Sovaldi. In addition, doctors may choose to wait to treat their genotype 1 HCV-infected patients until later in 2014 or 2015 when they anticipate the approval and availability of LDV/SOF and another competitor’s all-oral regimen for the treatment of genotype 1 HCV-infected patients. Also, because our HCV products represent a significant change in the treatment paradigm of HCV infection and are highly anticipated by the medical and patient community, sales levels or prescription growth rates early in the launch may not be indicative of future results. Because HCV-related revenues are difficult to predict, investors may have widely varying expectations that may be materially higher or lower than our actual revenues. To the extent Sovaldi revenues exceed or fall short of these expectations, our stock price may experience significant volatility.In the quarter ended June 30, 2014, approximately 86% of our product sales in the United States were to three wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen Corp., McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health, Inc. The U.S. wholesalers with whom we have entered into inventory management agreements make estimates to determine end user demand and may not be completely effective in matching their inventory levels to actual end user demand. As a result, changes in inventory levels held by those wholesalers can cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to these wholesalers do not match end user demand. In addition, inventory is held at retail pharmacies and other non-wholesaler locations with whom we have no inventory management agreements and no control over buying patterns. Adverse changes in economic conditions or other factors may cause retail pharmacies to reduce their inventories of our products, which would reduce their orders from wholesalers and, consequently, the wholesalers' orders from us, even if end user demand has not changed. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2013, strong wholesaler and sub-wholesaler purchases resulted in inventory draw-down by wholesalers and sub-wholesalers in the first quarter of 2014. As inventory in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter, we may continue to see fluctuations in our earnings and a mismatch between prescription demand for our products and our revenues.In addition, the non-retail sector in the United States, which includes government institutions, including state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs), correctional facilities and large health maintenance organizations, tends to be even less consistent in terms of buying patterns and often causes quarter over quarter fluctuations that do not necessarily mirror patient demand. Federal and state budget pressures, including sequestration, as well as the annual grant cycles for federal and state ADAP funds, may cause ADAP purchasing patterns to not reflect patient demand. For example, in the first quarters of certain prior years, we observed large non-retail purchases by a number of state ADAPs that exceeded patient demand. We believe 42such purchases were driven by the grant cycle for federal ADAP funds. We expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the purchasing patterns of our non-retail customers which may result in fluctuations in our product sales, revenues and earnings in the future. In light of the global economic downturn and budget crises faced by many European countries, we have observed variations in purchasing patterns induced by cost containment measures in Europe. We believe these measures have caused some government agencies and other purchasers to reduce inventory of our products in the distribution channels, which has decreased our revenues and caused fluctuations in our product sales and earnings. We may continue to see this trend in the future.Our results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reforms.Legislative and regulatory changes to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In March 2010, healthcare reform legislation was adopted in the United States, requiring us to further rebate or discount products reimbursed or paid for by various public payers, including Medicaid and other entities eligible to purchase discounted products through the 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Service Act, such as ADAPs. As a result of the 2010 legislation, the discounts, rebates and fees that impacted us include:•our minimum base rebate amount owed to Medicaid on products reimbursed by Medicaid increased by 8%, and the discounts or rebates we owe to ADAPs and other Public Health Service entities which reimburse or purchase our products also increased by 8%;•we are required to extend rebates to patients receiving our products through Medicaid managed care organizations;•we are required to provide a 50% discount on products sold to patients while they are in the Medicare Part D “donut hole;” and•we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of a new industry fee (also known as the pharmaceutical excise tax) of $3.0 billion for 2014, calculated based on select government sales during the 2012 calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales.The amount of the annual industry fee imposed on the pharmaceutical industry as a whole will be $3.0 billion in 2014 through 2016, increase to $4.0 billion in 2017, increase to a peak of $4.1 billion in 2018, and then decrease to $2.8 billion in 2019 and thereafter. We expect our portion of the pharmaceutical excise tax to increase as our revenues grow and as the amount of the annual industry fee increases through 2018 and drug patents expire on major drugs of other companies. We estimate our portion of the pharmaceutical excise tax to be approximately $150 - $170 million in 2014 compared to approximately $110 million in 2013 and approximately $85 million in 2012. The pharmaceutical excise tax is not tax deductible. Further, even though not addressed in the healthcare reform legislation, discussions continue at the federal level on legislation that would either allow or require the federal government to directly negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers or set minimum requirements for Medicare Part D pricing.In addition, state Medicaid programs could request additional supplemental rebates on our products as a result of the increase in the federal base Medicaid rebate. Private insurers could also use the enactment of these increased rebates to exert pricing pressure on our products, and to the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow Medicaid coverage and payment developments, the adverse effects may be magnified by private insurers adopting lower payment schedules.Our existing products are subject to reimbursement from government agencies and other third parties. Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressures may reduce profitability.Successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of governmental and third-party payer reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement. In the United States, the European Union and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices.A significant portion of our sales of the majority of our products are subject to significant discounts from list price and rebate obligations. In the United States, state ADAPs, which purchase a significant portion of our HIV products, rely on federal, supplemental federal and state funding to help fund purchases of our products. In recent years, we have experienced a shift in our payer mix as patients previously covered by private insurance move to public reimbursement programs that require rebates or discounts from us or as patients previously covered by one public reimbursement program move to another public reimbursement program that requires greater rebates or discounts from us. As a result of this shift, revenue growth may be lower than prescription growth. If federal and state funds are not available in amounts sufficient to support the number of patients that rely on ADAPs, sales of our HIV products could be negatively impacted which would reduce our revenues. For example, during the first quarter of 2011, the state budget crisis in Florida led to a temporary movement of patients who were 43previously covered by Florida's ADAP into industry-supported patient assistance programs. In prior quarters, because of the insufficiency of federal and state funds and as many states reduced eligibility criteria, we saw an increase in the number of patients on state ADAP waitlists, and we may see similar increases in future periods as a result of any reduction in federal and state ADAP support resulting from the sequestration. Until these patients are enrolled in ADAP, they generally receive product from industry-supported patient assistance programs or are unable to access treatment. The increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our product sales and profitability. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.In July 2014, we received a letter from the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance requesting information and supporting documentation from us related to Sovaldi and the pricing of Sovaldi in the United States. The letter raised concerns about our approach to pricing Sovaldi, its affordability and its impact on federal government spending and public health. We are cooperating with the inquiries. It is both costly and time-consuming for us to comply with these inquiries. We cannot predict the outcome. It is possible that the inquiries could result in negative publicity or other negative actions that could harm our reputation, reduce demand for Sovaldi or other sofosbuvir containing products and/or reduce coverage of Sovaldi or sofosbuvir containing products, including by federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. If any or all of these events occur, our business and stock price could be materially negatively affected. In countries outside the United States, the success of our commercialized products, and any other product candidates we may develop, will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because in many countries patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In addition, negotiating prices with certain governmental authorities can delay commercialization by 12 months or more. Reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. In many international markets, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals, including through the implementation of reference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes, tenders and profit control, and they expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as volumes increase.Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on our products, and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. For example, in June 2010, Spain imposed an incremental discount on all branded drugs. As generic drugs come to market, we may face price decreases for our products in some countries in the European Union. Further, cost containment pressures in the European Union, especially in Southern Europe, could lead to delays in the treatment of patients and also delay pricing approval, which could negatively impact the commercialization of new products. With respect to Sovaldi, we have seen pricing pressure, which could delay pricing approval in some European countries. Government agencies also issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. In addition, from time to time, professional societies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations and organizations publish guidelines or recommendations directed to certain health care and patient communities. Such recommendations and guidelines may relate to such matters as product usage, dosage, route of administration, and use of related or competing therapies and can consequently result in increased or decreased usage of our products.Approximately 25% of our product sales occur outside the United States, and currency fluctuations and hedging expenses may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price.Because a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative value of such sales increases. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business.We use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. We cannot predict future fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate of the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly against certain currencies and our hedging program does not 44sufficiently offset the effects of such appreciation, our results of operations will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.Additionally, the expenses that we recognize in relation to our hedging activities can also cause our earnings to fluctuate. The level of hedging expenses that we recognize in a particular period is impacted by the changes in interest rate spreads between the foreign currencies that we hedge and the U.S. dollar.We face significant competition.We face significant competition from large global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialized pharmaceutical firms and generic drug manufacturers.Our HCV product, Sovaldi competes with Janssen R&D Ireland's Olysio (simeprevir) in the United States and to a lesser extent with direct-acting antivirals, Victrelis (boceprevir) marketed by Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) and Incivek (telaprevir) marketed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.Our HIV products compete primarily with products from a joint venture established by GlaxoSmithKline Inc.(GSK) and Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer), ViiV, which markets fixed-dose combination products that compete with Stribild, Complera/Eviplera, Atripla and Truvada. For example, lamivudine, marketed by this joint venture, is competitive with emtricitabine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Emtriva and a component of Complera/Eviplera, Atripla and Truvada. For Tybost, we compete with ritonavir marketed by AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie). In addition, Tivicay (dolutegravir), an integrase inhibitor, launched in the fourth quarter of 2013 by ViiV, could adversely impact sales of our HIV products.We also face competition from generic HIV products. In May 2010, the compound patent covering Epivir (lamivudine) itself expired in the United States, and generic lamivudine is now available in the United States, Spain, Portugal and Italy. We expect that generic versions of lamivudine will be launched in other countries within the European Union. In May 2011, a generic version of Combivir (lamivudine and zidovudine) was approved and was recently launched in the United States. In addition, in late 2011, generic tenofovir also became available in Turkey, which resulted in an increase in the rebate for Viread in Turkey. Generic versions of Sustiva (efavirenz), a component of our Atripla, are now available in Canada and Europe and we expect competition from generic efavirenz to be in the United States in 2015. We have observed some pricing pressure related to the Sustiva component of our Atripla sales.For Viread and Hepsera for treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, we compete primarily with products produced by GSK, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Novartis) in the United States, the European Union and China.For AmBisome, we compete primarily with products produced by Merck and Pfizer. In addition, we are aware of at least three lipid formulations that claim similarity to AmBisome becoming available outside of the United States, including the possible entry of such formulations and Taiwan. These formulations may reduce market demand for AmBisome. Furthermore, the manufacture of lipid formulations of amphotericin B is very complex and if any of these formulations are found to be unsafe, sales of AmBisome may be negatively impacted by association.Letairis competes directly with products produced by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. and indirectly with pulmonary arterial hypertension products from United Therapeutics Corporation and Pfizer.Ranexa competes predominantly with generic compounds from three distinct classes of drugs, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates for the treatment of chronic angina in the United States.Cayston competes with a product marketed by Novartis.Tamiflu competes with products sold by GSK and generic competitors.Zydelig competes with a product marketed by Pharmacyclics, Inc. In addition, a number of companies are pursuing the development of technologies which are competitive with our existing products or research programs. These competing companies include specialized pharmaceutical firms and large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently or together with other pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs. If any of these competitors gain market share on our products, it could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price.If significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates, our future sales may be reduced, which would adversely affect our results of operations.45The data supporting the marketing approvals for our products and forming the basis for the safety warnings in our product labels were obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration and, in some cases, from post-approval use. As our products are used over longer periods of time by many patients with underlying health problems, taking numerous other medicines, we expect to continue to find new issues such as safety, resistance or drug interaction issues, which may require us to provide additional warnings or contraindications on our labels or narrow our approved indications, each of which could reduce the market acceptance of these products.Our product Letairis, which was approved by the FDA in June 2007, is a member of a class of compounds called endothelin receptor antagonists which pose specific risks, including serious risks of birth defects. Because of these risks, Letairis is available only through the Letairis Education and Access Program (LEAP), a restricted distribution program intended to help physicians and patients learn about the risks associated with the product and assure appropriate use of the product. As the product is used by additional patients, we may discover new risks associated with Letairis which may result in changes to the distribution program and additional restrictions on the use of Letairis which may decrease demand for the product. Regulatory authorities have been moving towards more active and transparent pharmacovigilance and are making greater amounts of stand-alone safety information and clinical trial data directly available to the public through websites and other means, e.g. periodic safety update report summaries, risk management plan summaries and various adverse event data. Safety information, without the appropriate context and expertise, may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action which may potentially cause our product sales or stock price to decline.Further, if serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues arise with our marketed products, sales of these products could be limited or halted by us or by regulatory authorities and our results of operations would be adversely affected.Our operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products.The products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the EMA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We are continuing clinical trials for Sovaldi, Stribild, Complera/Eviplera, Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Tybost, Zydelig, Vitekta, Hepsera, Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Cayston for currently approved and additional uses. We anticipate that we will file for marketing approval in additional countries and for additional indications and products over the next several years. These products may fail to receive such marketing approvals on a timely basis, or at all.Further, our marketed products and how we manufacture and sell these products are subject to extensive regulation and review. Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing or promotional activities may result in restrictions on our products, including withdrawal of the products from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those related to promotion and manufacturing, we could be subject to penalties including fines, suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products and criminal prosecution.For example, under FDA rules, we are often required to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk and implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for our products, which could include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to healthcare providers or other elements as the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the drug, which could include imposing certain restrictions on the distribution or use of a product. Failure to comply with these or other requirements, if imposed on a sponsor by the FDA, could result in significant civil monetary penalties and our operating results may be adversely affected.The results and anticipated timelines of our clinical trials are uncertain and may not support continued development of a product pipeline, which would adversely affect our prospects for future revenue growth.We are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of products that we develop for each intended use through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials. The results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. Even successfully completed large-scale clinical trials may not result in marketable products. If any of our product candidates fails to achieve its primary endpoint in clinical trials, if safety issues arise or if the results from our clinical trials are otherwise inadequate to support regulatory approval of our product candidates, commercialization of that product candidate could be delayed or halted. For example, in April 2013, we announced our decision to terminate our Phase 3 clinical trial of aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of bronchiectasis. In addition, we may also face challenges in clinical trial protocol design. If the clinical trials for any of the product candidates in our pipeline are delayed or terminated, our prospects for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted. For example, we face numerous risks and uncertainties with our product candidates, including momelotnib for the treatment of myelofibrosis, 46ranolazine for the treatment of incomplete revascularization post-percutaneous coronary intervention, our single tablet regimen of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine, and TAF as a standalone agent, each currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, that could prevent completion of development of these product candidates. These risks include our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials, the need to modify or delay our clinical trials or to perform additional trials and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. As a result, our product candidates may never be successfully commercialized. Further, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of our product candidates if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If these programs and others in our pipeline cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. In addition, clinical trials involving our commercial products could raise new safety issues for our existing products, which could in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business.Due to our reliance on third-party contract research organizations to conduct our clinical trials, we are unable to directly control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials.We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. We rely on independent third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to perform most of our clinical studies, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, program management and bioanalytical analysis. Many important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are out of our direct control. If there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our CROs, our clinical trials may be delayed. Moreover, in our regulatory submissions, we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third-party CROs. If any of our CROs' processes, methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or inadequate, our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals could be adversely impacted.Expenses associated with clinical trials may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price.The clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our products, as well as clinical trials we are required to conduct after approval, are very expensive. It is difficult to accurately predict or control the amount or timing of these expenses from quarter to quarter, and the FDA and/or other regulatory agencies may require more clinical testing than we originally anticipated. Uneven and unexpected spending on these programs, including on the clinical trials that will be necessary to advance our other product candidates, may cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and volatility in our stock price.We depend on relationships with other companies for sales and marketing performance, development and commercialization of product candidates and revenues. Failure to maintain these relationships, poor performance by these companies or disputes with these companies could negatively impact our business.We rely on a number of significant collaborative relationships with major pharmaceutical companies for our sales and marketing performance in certain territories. These include collaborations with BMS for Atripla in the United States, Europe and Canada; F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) for Tamiflu worldwide; and GSK for ambrisentan in territories outside of the United States. In some countries, we rely on international distributors for sales of Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva and AmBisome. Some of these relationships also involve the clinical development of these products by our partners. Reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including the risk that:•we are unable to control the resources our corporate partners devote to our programs or products;•disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of rights to technology developed with our corporate partners;•disagreements with our corporate partners could cause delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of product candidates or result in litigation or arbitration;•contracts with our corporate partners may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if one of these partners fails to perform;•our corporate partners have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional products and may pursue alternative technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors;•our corporate partners with marketing rights may choose to pursue competing technologies or to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our products than they do to products of their own development; and •our distributors and our corporate partners may be unable to pay us, particularly in light of current economic conditions.47Given these risks, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed or revenues from products could decline.Under our April 2002 licensing agreement with GSK, we gave GSK the right to control clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of Hepsera in territories in Asia, Africa and Latin America. These include major markets for Hepsera, such as China, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. In November 2009, we entered into an agreement with GSK that provided GSK with exclusive commercialization rights and registration responsibilities for Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV in China. In October 2010, we granted similar rights to GSK in Japan and Saudi Arabia. The success of Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV in these territories depends almost entirely on the efforts of GSK. In this regard, GSK promotes Epivir-HBV/Zeffix, a product that competes with Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV. Consequently, GSK's marketing strategy for Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV may be influenced by its promotion of Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. We receive royalties from GSK equal to a percentage of GSK's net sales of Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV as well as net sales of GSK's Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. If GSK fails to devote sufficient resources to, or does not succeed in developing or commercializing Hepsera or Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV in its territories, our potential revenues in these territories may be substantially reduced.In addition, Cayston and Letairis are distributed through third-party specialty pharmacies, which are pharmacies specializing in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions that may require a high level of patient education and ongoing counseling. The use of specialty pharmacies requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing, medical affairs, regulatory affairs, legal and finance organizations and involves risks, including but not limited to risks that these specialty pharmacies will:•not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, patient data or safety complaints;•not effectively sell or support Cayston or Letairis;•not devote the resources necessary to sell Cayston or Letairis in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;•not be able to satisfy their financial obligations to us or others; or•cease operations.We also rely on a third party to administer LEAP, the restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis. This third party provides information and education to prescribers and patients on the risks of Letairis, confirms insurance coverage and investigates alternative sources of reimbursement or assistance, ensures fulfillment of the risk management requirements mandated for Letairis by the FDA and coordinates and controls dispensing to patients through the third-party specialty pharmacies. Failure of this third party or the specialty pharmacies that distribute Letairis to perform as expected may result in regulatory action from the FDA or decreased Letairis sales, either of which would harm our business.Further, Cayston may only be taken by patients using a specific inhalation device that delivers the drug to the lungs of patients. Our ongoing distribution of Cayston is entirely reliant upon the manufacturer of that device. For example, the manufacturer could encounter other issues with regulatory agencies related to the device or be unable to supply sufficient quantities of this device. In addition, the manufacturer may not be able to provide adequate warranty support for the device after it has been distributed to patients. With respect to distribution of the drug and device to patients, we are reliant on the capabilities of specialty pharmacies. For example, the distribution channel for drug and device is complicated and requires coordination. The reimbursement approval processes associated with both drug and device are similarly complex. If the device manufacturer is unable to obtain reimbursement approval or receives approval at a lower-than-expected price, sales of Cayston may be adversely affected. Any of the previously described issues may limit the sales of Cayston, which would adversely affect our financial results.Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to defend our patents and other intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally. We may not be able to obtain effective patents to protect our technologies from use by competitors and patents of other companies could require us to stop using or pay for the use of required technology.Patents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to:•obtain patents and licenses to patent rights;•preserve trade secrets;•defend against infringement and efforts to invalidate our patents; and•operate without infringing on the intellectual property of others.48If we have a properly drafted and enforceable patent, it can be more difficult for our competitors to use our technology to create competitive products and more difficult for our competitors to obtain a patent that prevents us from using technology we create. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection both in the United States and internationally and file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements in our compounds, products and technology.We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications and rights to patents related to our compounds, products and technology, but we cannot be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents. Patent applications are confidential for a period of time before a patent is issued. As a result, we may not know if our competitors filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent applications. Competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our products. In addition, if competitors file patent applications covering our technology, we may have to participate in litigation, interference or other proceedings to determine the right to a patent. Litigation, interference or other proceedings are unpredictable and expensive, such that, even if we are ultimately successful, our results of operations may be adversely affected by such events.Patents do not cover the ranolazine compound, the active ingredient of Ranexa. Instead, when it was discovered that only a sustained-release formulation of ranolazine would achieve therapeutic plasma levels, patents were obtained on those formulations and the characteristic plasma levels they achieve. Patents do not cover the active ingredients in AmBisome. In addition, we do not have patent filings in China or certain other Asian countries covering all forms of adefovir dipivoxil, the active ingredient in Hepsera. Asia is a major market for therapies for HBV, the indication for which Hepsera has been developed.We may obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained for those products. Because patents have a limited life, which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of the patent may be limited. However, we may be able to apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates in some countries.Generic manufacturers have sought, and may continue to seek, FDA approval to market generic versions of our products through an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. See a description of our ANDA litigation in "Legal Proceedings" beginning on page 36 and risk factor entitled "Litigation with generic manufacturers has reduced and may continue to reduce our earnings. If we are unsuccessful in all or some of these lawsuits, some or all of our claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and generic versions of our products could be launched prior to our patent expiry." beginning on page 54.Our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.If we infringe the valid patents of third parties, we may be prevented from commercializing products or may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties. We may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain these licenses or alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products. For example, we are aware of patents that may relate to our operation of LEAP, our restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis and we are aware of patents and patent applications owned by other parties that may claim to cover the use of sofosbuvir. See a description of our litigation regarding sofosbuvir in the risk factor entitled "If any party is successful in establishing exclusive rights to sofosbuvir, our expected revenues and earnings from the sale of sofosbuvir could be adversely affected" beginning on page 50.Furthermore, we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented internal know-how and technological innovation. In particular, a great deal of our liposomal manufacturing expertise, which is a key component of our liposomal technology, is not covered by patents but is instead protected as a trade secret. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by an individual while employed by us will be our exclusive property. We cannot be certain that these parties will comply with these confidentiality agreements, that we have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. Under some of our R&D agreements, inventions become jointly owned by us and our corporate partner and in other cases become the exclusive property of one party. In certain circumstances, it can be difficult to determine who owns a particular invention and disputes could arise regarding those inventions. If our trade secrets or confidential information become known or independently 49discovered by competitors or if we enter into disputes over ownership of inventions, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.If any party is successful in establishing exclusive rights to sofosbuvir, our expected revenues and earnings from the sale of sofosbuvir could be adversely affected.We own patents that claim sofosbuvir as a chemical entity and its metabolites. However, the existence of patents does not necessarily guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have, or obtain rights to, patents that allegedly could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing sofosbuvir. For example, we are aware of patents and patent applications owned by other parties that may be alleged by such parties to cover the use of sofosbuvir. If these parties successfully obtain valid and enforceable patents, and successfully prove infringement of those patents by sofosbuvir, we could be prevented from selling sofosbuvir unless we were able to obtain a license under such patents. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Further, if any party is successful in establishing exclusive rights to sofosbuvir, our expected revenues and earnings from the sale of sofosbuvir would be adversely affected.Arbitration with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd and Hoffman-La Roche Inc. (collectively, Roche)Gilead (as successor to Pharmasset) is a party to an October 29, 2004 collaboration agreement with Roche. The agreement granted Roche rights to develop PSI-6130, a cytidine analog, and its prodrugs, for the treatment of HCV infection. The collaborative research efforts under the agreement ended on December 31, 2006. Roche later asked Pharmasset to consider whether Roche may have contributed to the inventorship of sofosbuvir and whether Pharmasset has complied with the confidentiality provisions of the collaboration agreement. Pharmasset advised us that it carefully considered the issues raised by Roche and that it believed any such issues are without merit. We have also considered these issues and reached the same conclusion. In March 2013, Roche initiated an arbitration against us and Pharmasset, predecessor to Gilead Pharmasset LLC, regarding the collaboration agreement. In the arbitration demand, Roche asserts that it has an exclusive license to sofosbuvir pursuant to the collaboration agreement because sofosbuvir, a prodrug of a uridine monophosphate analog, is allegedly a prodrug of PSI-6130, a cytidine analog. Roche further claims that, because it has exclusive rights to sofosbuvir, it also has an exclusive license to a patent covering sofosbuvir, and that we will infringe that patent by selling and offering for sale products containing sofosbuvir. Gilead and Gilead Pharmasset LLC filed their response to Roche's arbitration demand in April 2013. The arbitration hearing was held in New York in June 2014. We expect a decision in the arbitration by the end of 2014.Interference Proceedings and Litigation with Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Idenix)In February 2012, we received notice that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) had declared Interference No. 105,871 (First Idenix Interference) between our U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572 and Idenix's pending U.S. Patent Application No. 12/131,868. An interference is an administrative proceeding before the USPTO designed to determine who was the first to invent the subject matter claimed by both parties. Our patent covers metabolites of sofosbuvir and RG7128, a prodrug of a cytidine nucleoside analog that Pharmasset licensed to Roche. Idenix is attempting to patent a class of compounds, including these metabolites. The purpose of the First Idenix Interference was to determine who was first to invent these compounds and therefore who is entitled to the patent claiming these compounds. In March 2013, the USPTO Patent Trials and Appeal Board (the Board) determined that Idenix is not entitled to the benefit of any of its early application filing dates because none of those patent applications, including the application that led to Idenix’s U.S. Patent No. 7,608,600 (the ‘600 patent), taught how to make the compounds in dispute. The Board also determined that because we are entitled to the filing date of our earliest application, we were first to file the patent application on the compounds in dispute, and we were therefore the “senior party” in the First Idenix Interference. On January 29, 2014, the Board determined that Pharmasset and not Idenix was the first to invent the compounds in dispute and accordingly Gilead prevailed. In its decision, the Board held that Idenix failed to prove that it was first to conceive of any of the compounds in dispute. Specifically, Idenix failed to prove that the Idenix inventors had identified the structure, a method of making and a use for any of the disputed compounds. The Board went on to conclude that Idenix failed to work diligently toward making and testing the compounds in dispute during the relevant time period. Idenix has appealed the Board’s decisions to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. If either or both of the Board’s decisions are reversed on appeal and the court determines that Idenix is entitled to their patent claims, and it is determined that we have infringed those claims, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Idenix to commercialize sofosbuvir and RG7128 in the United States. A decision by the District Court can be appealed by either party to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC).We believe the claims in the Idenix application involved in the First Idenix Interference, and similar U.S. and foreign patents claiming the same compounds and metabolites, are invalid. As a result, we filed an Impeachment Action in the Federal Court of Canada to invalidate Idenix Canadian Patent No. 2,490,191 (the ‘191 patent), which is the Canadian patent that corresponds to the ’600 patent and the Idenix patent application that is the subject of the First Idenix Interference. Idenix has 50now asserted that the commercialization of Sovaldi in Canada will infringe its ‘191 patent and that our Canadian Patent No. 2,527,657, corresponding to our U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572 in the First Idenix Interference, is invalid.We filed a similar legal action in Norway in the Oslo District Court seeking to invalidate Idenix's corresponding Norwegian patent. In September 2013, Idenix filed an invalidation action in the Norwegian proceedings against our Norwegian Patent No. 333700 patent, which corresponds to our U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572. The trial was held in November 2013. On March 21, 2014, the Norwegian court found all claims in the Idenix Norwegian patent to be invalid and upheld the validity of all claims in the challenged Gilead patent. Additionally, the Norwegian court ordered Idenix to pay us over $2.0 million in attorney fees as the losing party to the litigation. On April 30, 2014, Idenix appealed the March 21, 2014 decision to the Norwegian Court of Appeal. Idenix’s obligation to pay our attorneys’ fees will be stayed during the pendency of the appeal.In August 2013 and April 2014, Idenix filed two separate requests for invalidation with the Chinese Patent Office of our Chinese Patent CN ZL200480019148.4, which corresponds to our U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572 patent.We filed a legal action in the Federal Court of Australia seeking to invalidate Idenix’s Australian patent corresponding to the ‘600 patent. In April 2013, Idenix asserted that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe the Australian patent corresponding to the ‘600 patent.On March 12, 2014, the European Patent Office (EPO) granted Idenix European Patent No. 1 523 489 (the ‘489 patent), which corresponds to the ‘600 patent. The same day that the ‘489 patent granted, we filed an opposition with the EPO seeking to revoke the ‘489 patent. Also on March 12, 2014, Idenix initiated infringement proceedings against us in the United Kingdom, Germany and France alleging that the commercialization of Sovaldi in those countries would infringe the respective national counterparts of the ‘489 patent. In the United Kingdom, the court has ordered an October 2014 trial date to determine the issues of infringement and validity of the Idenix United Kingdom patent. In Germany, the court in Düsseldorf has ordered a hearing date of December 2, 2014 to determine the issue of infringement of the Idenix German patent. We do not have a trial date for the French lawsuit.Idenix has not been awarded patents corresponding to the ‘600 patent in Japan or China. In the event such patents issue, we expect to challenge them in proceedings similar to those we invoked in Europe, Canada, Norway and Australia. If the courts hearing these proceedings determine that Idenix is entitled to their patent claims and it is determined that we have infringed those claims, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Idenix to commercialize sofosbuvir and RG7128 in that country.In December 2013, after receiving Gilead’s request to do so, the USPTO declared Interference No. 105,981 (Second Idenix Interference) between our pending U.S. Patent Application No. 11/854,218 and the ‘600 patent. The ‘600 patent includes claims directed to methods of treating HCV with nucleoside compounds similar to those which were involved in the First Idenix Interference. The Second Idenix Interference will determine who was first to invent the claimed methods of treating HCV. In the declaration of the Second Idenix Interference, the USPTO has initially designated Gilead as the junior party based upon the patent application filing dates appearing on the face of the ‘600 patent. We believe the Board’s determination in the First Idenix Interference that Idenix is not entitled the benefit of any of its earlier application filing dates, including the filing date of the ‘600 patent, will be equally applicable to the Second Idenix Interference. If we are correct, the Board may conclude that Gilead is the senior party in the Second Idenix Interference, consistent with the determination in the First Idenix Interference. In light of the Board’s conclusion in the First Idenix Interference that the application that led to the ‘600 patent does not teach how to make the claimed compounds, it is possible that the Board will make the same determination in the Second Idenix Interference and eliminate the need for the Board to address who was the first to invent the claimed methods of treating HCV. However, if the Board does consider who was the first to invent the claimed methods of treating HCV and ultimately concludes that Gilead was first, the claims in the ‘600 patent may be revoked. If the Board determines that Idenix was first to invent and is entitled to these patent claims, and it is determined in other proceedings that we have infringed those claims, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Idenix to commercialize sofosbuvir and RG7128. Any determination by the Board can be appealed by either party to U.S. federal court.In December 2013, Idenix, Universita Degli Studi di Cagliari (UDSG), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and L’Université Montpellier II sued us in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe the ‘600 patent and that an interference exists between the ‘600 patent and our U.S. Patent No. 8,415,322 patent. We believe that the claims in the ‘600 patent are invalid and that we have the sole right to commercialize sofosbuvir. However, if the court disagrees with our view and further determines that the ‘600 patent is infringed, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Idenix to commercialize sofosbuvir. A decision by the District Court can be appealed by either party to the CAFC.Also in December 2013, Idenix and UDSG sued us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 6,914,054 and 7,608,597. On June 30, 2014, the court in 51Massachusetts granted our request and transferred the Massachusetts litigation to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. We believe that Idenix’s patents are invalid and would not be infringed by our commercialization of sofosbuvir and that we have the sole right to commercialize sofosbuvir. However, if the court disagrees with our view and determines that these patents are infringed, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Idenix to commercialize sofosbuvir. A decision by the District Court can be appealed by either party to the CAFC.We have an expansive patent portfolio covering NS5A inhibitors for the treatment of HCV. Following the disclosure of the structure of Idenix’s NS5A inhibitor, samatasvir (also known as IDX-719), we are evaluating the compound in light of the claims of our granted U.S. Patent No. 8,669,234.On June 9, 2014, Merck and Idenix announced that the companies had entered into a definitive agreement under which Merck will acquire Idenix. The court has set a trial date of March 7, 2016 for this litigation. While this merger does not change our view of the merits of Merck's and Idenix's claims, Merck has greater resources than Idenix and may therefore choose to fund the litigation at higher levels than Idenix.Litigation with Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck)In August 2013, Merck contacted us requesting that we pay royalties on the sales of sofosbuvir and obtain a license to U.S. Patent Nos. 7,105,499 and 8,481,712, which it co-owns with Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We believe that Merck’s patents are invalid and would not be infringed by our commercialization of sofosbuvir and that we have the sole right to commercialize sofosbuvir. Accordingly, in August 2013, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking declaratory judgment that the Merck patents are invalid and not infringed. Merck’s U.S. Patent Nos. 7,105,499 and 8,481,712 cover compounds which do not include, but may relate to, sofosbuvir. During patent prosecution, Merck amended its patent application in an attempt to cover compounds related to sofosbuvir and ultimately extract royalty payments for sofosbuvir’s commercialization, or to exclude it from the market. If the court determines that Merck’s patents are valid and that we have infringed those claims, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Merck to commercialize sofosbuvir. Either party can appeal a decision by the District Court to the CAFC. The court has set a trial date of March 7, 2016 for this litigation. Litigation with AbbVieAbbVie has obtained U.S. Patent Nos. 8,466,159, 8,492,386, 8,680,106, and 8,685,984, which purport to claim the use of a combination of LDV/SOF for the treatment of HCV. We own published and pending patent applications directed to the use of combinations for the treatment of HCV, and, specifically, to combinations of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. Certain of those applications were filed before AbbVie’s patents. For this reason and others, we believe AbbVie’s patents are invalid.Accordingly, in December 2013, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware seeking declaratory judgment that the AbbVie patents are invalid and unenforceable, as well as other relief. We believe that Abbott Laboratories, Inc. and AbbVie conspired to eliminate competition in the HCV market by falsely representing to the USPTO that they, and not Gilead, invented methods of treating HCV using a combination of LDV/SOF. In February and March 2014, AbbVie responded to our lawsuit by filing two lawsuits also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that our fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF will infringe its patents. We do not expect AbbVie’s patents to block or delay the commercialization of our combination products. If the court determines that AbbVie’s patents are valid and that we have infringed those claims, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to AbbVie to commercialize sofosbuvir combination products. Either party can appeal a decision by the District Court to the CAFC. We are aware that AbbVie is pursuing similar patents in Europe and other countries.We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of contractual and intellectual property claims related to sofosbovir, and we may spend significant resources enforcing and defending these patents. If these parties successfully obtain valid and enforceable patents, and successfully prove infringement of those patents by sofosbuvir, we could be prevented from selling sofosbuvir unless we were able to obtain a license under such patents. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Further, if any party is successful in establishing exclusive rights to sofosbuvir, our expected revenues and earnings from the sale of sofosbuvir would be adversely affected. Manufacturing problems, including at our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners, could cause inventory shortages and delay product shipments and regulatory approvals, which may adversely affect our results of operations.In order to generate revenue from our products, we must be able to produce sufficient quantities of our products to satisfy demand. Many of our products are the result of complex manufacturing processes. The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is also highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations.52Our products are either manufactured at our own facilities or by third-party manufacturers or corporate partners. We depend on third parties to perform manufacturing activities effectively and on a timely basis for the majority of our solid dose products. In addition, Roche, either by itself or through third parties, is responsible for manufacturing Tamiflu. We, our third-party manufacturers and our corporate partners are subject to current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards as defined by the FDA and the EMA. Similar regulations are in effect in other countries. Our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners are independent entities who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks which are out of our control. If we or any of these third-party manufacturers or corporate partners fail to perform as required, this could impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis or receive royalties or cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. Further, we may have to write-off the costs of manufacturing any batch that fails to pass quality inspection. To the extent these risks materialize and affect their performance obligations to us, our financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, we, our third-party manufacturers and our corporate partners may only be able to produce some of our products at one or a limited number of facilities and, therefore, have limited manufacturing capacity for certain products. For example, in 2012, due to unexpected delays both in qualifying two new external sites and with expanding Cayston manufacturing in San Dimas, we were unable to supply enough Cayston to fulfill our projected demand. From February through September 2012, we suspended access for patients with new prescriptions for Cayston, subject to certain exceptions where specific medical need existed. As a result of our inability to manufacture sufficient Cayston to meet demand, the amount of revenues we received from the sale of Cayston was reduced.Our manufacturing operations are subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies. For example, in April 2013, the FDA conducted an inspection of our Foster City facility and issued Form 483 Inspectional Observations, which noted deficiencies in documentation and validation of certain quality testing procedures and methods. As a result of the observations, the FDA delivered Complete Response Letters notifying us that it was unable to approve our NDAs for elvitegravir and cobicistat as standalone agents. In mid-October 2013, the FDA completed its sofosbuvir pre-approval inspection of our Foster City facility. Following that inspection, the FDA issued additional Form 483 Inspectional Observations citing deficiencies related to testing and reconciliation of stability samples, testing protocols, testing of shipping samples, and procedures for calibrating test equipment. We recently completed and filed our responses to these observations with the FDA. If we are unable to remedy the deficiencies cited by the FDA in these inspections, our currently marketed products and the timing of regulatory approval of products in development could be adversely affected. Further, there is risk that regulatory agencies in other countries where marketing applications are pending will undertake similar additional reviews or apply a heightened standard of review, which could delay the regulatory approvals for products in those countries. If approval of any of our product candidates, including LDV/SOF or elvitegravir and cobicistat, as standalone agents, were delayed or if production of our marketed products was interrupted, our anticipated revenues and our stock price would be adversely affected.We may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, which would limit our ability to generate revenues.We need access to certain supplies and products to conduct our clinical trials and to manufacture our products. In light of the global economic downturn, we have had increased difficulty in purchasing certain of the raw materials used in our manufacturing processes. If we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of these materials or find suitable alternate materials in a timely manner, our development efforts for our product candidates may be delayed or our ability to manufacture our products would be limited, which would limit our ability to generate revenues.Suppliers of key components and materials must be named in an NDA filed with the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authority for any product candidate for which we are seeking marketing approval, and significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required. Even after a manufacturer is qualified by the regulatory authority, the manufacturer must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with GMP. Manufacturers are subject to regular, periodic inspections by the regulatory authorities following initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, a regulatory authority determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, the regulatory authority may suspend the manufacturing operations. If the manufacturing operations of any of the single suppliers for our products are suspended, we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of product to meet market demand, which would in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business. In addition, if delivery of material from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason, we may be unable to ship certain of our products for commercial supply or to supply our products in development for clinical trials. In addition, some of our products and the materials that we utilize in our operations are made at only one facility. For example, we manufacture certain drug product intermediates utilized in AmBisome exclusively at our facilities in San Dimas, California. In the event of a disaster, including an earthquake, equipment failure or other difficulty, we 53may be unable to replace this manufacturing capacity in a timely manner and may be unable to manufacture AmBisome to meet market needs. In addition, we depend on a single supplier for high-quality cholesterol and active pharmaceutical ingredient, which is used in the manufacture of AmBisome. We also rely on a single source for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Letairis. Astellas US LLC, which markets Lexiscan in the United States, is responsible for the commercial manufacture and supply of product in the United States and is dependent on a single supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Lexiscan. Problems with any of the single suppliers we depend on may negatively impact our development and commercialization efforts. A significant portion of the raw materials and intermediates used to manufacture our HIV products (Sovaldi, Stribild, Complera/Eviplera, Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Emtriva and Tybost) are supplied by Chinese-based companies. As a result, an international trade dispute between China and the United States or any other actions by the Chinese government that would limit or prevent Chinese companies from supplying these materials would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our HIV products to meet market needs and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results. Litigation with generic manufacturers has reduced and may continue to reduce our earnings. If we are unsuccessful in all or some of these lawsuits, some or all of our claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and generic versions of our products could be launched prior to our patent expiry.As part of the approval process for some of our products, the FDA granted us a New Chemical Entity (NCE) exclusivity period during which other manufacturers' applications for approval of generic versions of our product will not be approved. Generic manufacturers may challenge the patents protecting products that have been granted NCE exclusivity one year prior to the end of the NCE exclusivity period. Generic manufacturers have sought and may continue to seek FDA approval for a similar or identical drug through an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. Current legal proceedings of significance with some of our generic manufacturers include:NatcoIn March 2011, we and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (Roche) filed a lawsuit against Natco Pharma Ltd. (Natco) in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for infringement of one of the patents associated with Tamiflu. In December 2012, the court issued a ruling in favor of Gilead and Roche, that our patent is not invalid for the reasons stated in Natco’s notice letter. Natco has appealed this decision to the CAFC. In April 2014, the CAFC issued a decision which will allow Natco’s patent invalidity challenge to proceed if the case is remanded to the District Court of New Jersey for a full trial on the merits. On June 30, 2014, we filed a petition for rehearing en banc with the CAFC.TevaIn August 2012, Teva Pharmaceuticals (Teva) filed an Impeachment Action in the Federal Court of Canada seeking invalidation of our two Canadian patents associated with Viread. In September 2013, a hearing on the consolidated requests for orders of prohibition in connection with all three of Teva’s abbreviated new drug submission (ANDS) filings to the Canadian Minister of Health (for Teva’s generic versions of Viread, Truvada, and Atripla) took place. In December 2013, the court issued our requested order prohibiting the Canadian Ministry of Health from issuing a Notice of Compliance for Teva’s generic versions of our Viread, Truvada, and Atripla products until expiry of our patent in July 2017. Teva appealed the decision of the court prohibiting the Minister of Heath from issuing the Notices of Compliance until expiry of our patent in July 2017. This decision did not rule on the validity of the patents and accordingly the only issue on appeal is whether the Minister of Health should be prohibited from issuing the Notices of Compliance for Teva’s products. Separately, the court will determine the validity of the patents in the pending Impeachment Action. A trial in the Impeachment Action is scheduled for March 2015. If Teva is successful in invalidating our patents, Teva may be able to launch generic versions of our Viread, Truvada and Atripla products in Canada prior to the expiry of our patents.In April 2013, we and Teva reached an agreement to settle the ongoing patent litigation concerning the four patents that protect tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in our Atripla, Truvada and Viread products. Under the agreement, Teva will be allowed to launch a generic version of Viread on December 15, 2017. In April 2014, we and Teva entered an agreement to settle the ongoing patent litigation concerning the emtricitabine patents that protect Atripla and Truvada. The terms of the settlement agreement are confidential.LupinIn 2012, we filed lawsuits against Lupin Limited (Lupin) in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for infringement of our emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil patents related to Viread and Truvada. In May 2014, Lupin amended its ANDAs to certify that it is no longer seeking approval to market generic versions of Truvada and Viread prior to the 54expiration of the four patents associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in January 2018 (including pediatric exclusivity). As a result, in May 2014, the court granted Gilead and Lupin's Joint Motion for Order of Dismissal in our patent infringement lawsuit against Lupin for the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate patents. A trial relating to Lupin’s ANDA requesting permission to make a generic version of Truvada before the expiry of our patents covering emtricitabine is scheduled for December 2014. In August 2013, we and Lupin reached an agreement to settle the patent litigation concerning certain patents that protect Ranexa. Under the agreement, Lupin would be allowed to launch a generic version of Ranexa on February 27, 2019. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the foregoing actions and other litigation with generic manufacturers, and we may spend significant resources enforcing and defending these patents. If we are unsuccessful in these lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for Truvada, Viread, Emtriva and Tamiflu in the United States and Atripla, Truvada and Viread in Canada could be substantially shortened. Further, if all of the patents covering one or more products are invalidated, the FDA or Canadian Minister of Health could approve the requests to manufacture a generic version of such products in the United States or Canada, respectively, prior to the expiration date of those patents. The sale of generic versions of these products earlier than their patent expiration would have a significant negative effect on our revenues and results of operations.We face credit risks from our Southern European customers that may adversely affect our results of operations.Our European product sales to government-owned or supported customers in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have historically been and continue to be subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. This has resulted and may continue to result in days sales outstanding being significantly higher in these countries due to the average length of time that accounts receivable remain outstanding. As of June 30, 2014, our accounts receivable in these countries totaled approximately $652.4 million, of which $173.0 million were past due greater than 120 days and $53.6 million were past due greater than 365 days as follows:  June 30, 2014 (In thousands) Greater than120 days past due Greater than365 days past duePortugal $74,001 $26,033Italy 43,195 26,548Spain 46,597 428Greece 9,245 639Total $173,038 $53,648Historically, receivable balances with certain publicly-owned hospitals accumulate over a period of time and are then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments. This pattern is also experienced by other pharmaceutical companies that sell directly to hospitals. If significant changes were to occur in the reimbursement practices of these European governments or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from these customers and our results of operations would be adversely affected.Our revenues and gross margin could be reduced by imports from countries where our products are available at lower prices.Prices for our products are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country. Our sales in countries with relatively higher prices may be reduced if products can be imported into those or other countries from lower price markets. There have been cases in which other pharmaceutical products were sold at steeply discounted prices in the developing world and then re-exported to European countries where they could be re-sold at much higher prices. If this happens with our products, particularly Truvada and Viread, which we have agreed to make available at substantially reduced prices to more than 125 countries participating in our Gilead Access Program, or Atripla, which Merck distributes at substantially reduced prices to HIV infected patients in developing countries under our 2006 agreement, our revenues would be adversely affected. In addition, we have established partnerships with Indian generic manufacturers to distribute high-quality, low-cost generic versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to 112 developing world countries, including India. We expanded these agreements to include rights to Stribild, Tybost and Vitekta. We also entered into collaborations with certain Indian generic manufacturers to produce and distribute generic emtricitabine in the developing world, including single tablet regimens containing emtricitabine and fixed-dose combinations of emtricitabine co-formulated with our other HIV medicines. If generic versions of our medications under these licenses are then re-exported to the United States, Europe or other markets outside of these 112 countries, our revenues would be adversely affected. We also also committed to making Sovaldi available in the developing world at discounted prices and recently entered into an agreement to make Sovaldi available in 55Egypt, a country that has among the highest HCV prevalence in the world. If the discounted Sovaldi is re-exported from these developing countries into the United States or other higher price markets, our revenues could be adversely affected.In addition, purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively high may adversely impact our revenues and gross margin and may cause our sales to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For example, in the European Union, we are required to permit products purchased in one country to be sold in another country. Purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively high can affect the inventory level held by our wholesalers and can cause the relative sales levels in the various countries to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and not reflect the actual consumer demand in any given quarter. These quarterly fluctuations may impact our earnings, which could adversely affect our stock price and harm our business.Expensive litigation and government investigations have reduced and may continue to reduce our earnings.We are involved in a number of litigation, investigation and other dispute-related matters that require us to expend substantial internal and financial resources. We expect these matters will continue to require a high level of internal and financial resources for the foreseeable future. These matters have reduced and will continue to reduce our earnings. Please see a description of our Litigation Regarding Sofosbuvir, Litigation with Generic Manufacturers and the Department of Justice investigation; in "Legal Proceedings" beginning on page 36. The outcome of the lawsuits above, or any other lawsuits that may be brought against us, the investigation or any other investigations that may be initiated, are inherently uncertain, and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant expenses, monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us that could significantly reduce our earnings and cash flows and harm our business.In some countries, we may be required to grant compulsory licenses for our products or our patents may not be enforced.In a number of developing countries, government officials and other interested groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs for HCV or HIV infection available at low cost. Alternatively, governments in those developing countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products, thereby reducing our product sales. For example, there is growing attention on the availability of HCV therapies and some activists are advocating for the increased availability of HCV therapies through means including compulsory licenses. In the past, certain offices of the government of Brazil have expressed concern over the affordability of our HIV products and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory licenses to permit the manufacture of otherwise patented products for HIV infection, including Viread. In addition, concerns over the cost and availability of Tamiflu related to a potential avian flu pandemic and H1N1 influenza generated international discussions over compulsory licensing of our Tamiflu patents. For example, the Canadian government considered allowing Canadian manufacturers to manufacture and export the active ingredient in Tamiflu to eligible developing and least developed countries under Canada's Access to Medicines Regime. Furthermore, Roche issued voluntary licenses to permit third-party manufacturing of Tamiflu. For example, Roche granted a sublicense to Shanghai Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. for China and a sublicense to India's Hetero Drugs Limited for India and certain developing countries. If compulsory licenses permit generic manufacturing to override our product patents for Sovaldi, our HIV products or Tamiflu, or if we are required to grant compulsory licenses for these products, it could reduce our earnings and cash flows and harm our business.In addition, certain countries do not permit enforcement of our patents, and third-party manufacturers are able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries. For example, in July 2009, the Brazilian patent authority rejected our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viread. This was the highest level of appeal available to us within the Brazilian patent authority. Because we do not currently have a patent in Brazil, the Brazilian government now purchases its supply of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate from generic manufacturers. Sales of generic versions of our products could significantly reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if generic versions of our products are imported into territories where we have existing commercial sales.Changes in royalty revenue disproportionately affect our pre-tax income, earnings per share and gross margins.A portion of our revenues is derived from royalty revenues recognized from collaboration agreements with third parties. Royalty revenues impact our pre-tax income, earnings per share and gross margins disproportionately more than their contributions to our revenues. Any increase or decrease to our royalty revenue could be material and could significantly impact our operating results. For example, Roche's Tamiflu sales have unpredictable variability due to their strong relationship with seasonal influenza and global pandemic planning efforts. During periods when our royalty revenue from Tamiflu increase, we will see a disproportionate increase in our pre-tax income, earnings per share and gross margins. Similarly, during periods when our royalty from Tamiflu decrease, we will see a disproportionate decrease in our pre-tax income, earnings per share and gross margins.56We may face significant liability resulting from our products that may not be covered by insurance and successful claims could materially reduce our earnings.The testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our commercial products, as well as product candidates in development, involve substantial risk of product liability claims. These claims may be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others. In recent years, coverage and availability of cost-effective product liability insurance has decreased, so we may be unable to maintain sufficient coverage for product liabilities that may arise. In addition, the cost to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims may exceed our coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate coverage or if claims exceed our coverage, our financial condition and our ability to clinically test our product candidates and market our products will be adversely impacted. In addition, negative publicity associated with any claims, regardless of their merit, may decrease the future demand for our products and impair our financial condition. Business disruptions from natural or man-made disasters may harm our future revenues.Our worldwide operations could be subject to business interruptions stemming from natural or man-made disasters for which we may be self-insured. Our corporate headquarters and Fremont locations, which together house a majority of our R&D activities, and our San Dimas and Oceanside manufacturing facilities are located in California, a seismically active region. As we do not carry earthquake insurance and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, our portion of the non-tax deductible pharmaceutical excise tax, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, mergers and acquisitions, changes in forecasted demand for our HCV products, the ability to manufacture product in our Cork, Ireland facility, the amortization of certain acquisition related intangibles for which we receive no tax benefit, expiration of the federal research tax credit, future levels of R&D spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings and resolution of federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income.Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.If we fail to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop new product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates.Our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, governmental regulation and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense, and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms. If we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts, our business may be harmed.57ITEM 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
