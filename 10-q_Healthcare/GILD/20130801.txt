Item 1A. Risk Factors”) included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars.Management Overview Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we or us), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and investigational drug candidate, we seek to improve the care of patients living with life-threatening diseases around the world. Gilead's primary areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), serious cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and oncology/inflammation. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. We continue to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal research and clinical development programs and through our product acquisition and in-licensing strategy. Our portfolio of 15 marketed products is comprised of Stribild®, Complera®/Eviplera®, Atripla®, Truvada®, Viread®, Hepsera®, Emtriva®, Letairis®, Ranexa®, AmBisome®, Cayston®, Vistide®, Tamiflu®, Lexiscan® and Macugen®. We have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. In addition, we also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements. Business HighlightsDuring the second quarter of 2013, our product sales increased 14% over the same quarter in 2012, and we continued to advance our product pipeline across all therapeutic areas. We believe the combination of our existing internal research programs, acquisitions and partnerships will allow us to continue to bring innovative therapies to individuals who are living with unmet medical needs. During the quarter, we made the following announcements:22HCV Program•We filed a new drug application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the approval of sofosbuvir, a once-daily oral nucleotide analogue inhibitor for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. The FDA has granted priority review status and has set a target review date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of December 8, 2013. The NDA is supported primarily by results from four Phase 3 studies (NEUTRINO, FISSION, POSITRON and FUSION) evaluating sofosbuvir in nearly 1,000 patients with HCV as part of an all-oral 12-week or 16-week treatment regimen in combination with ribavirin (RBV) in genotypes 2 and 3, or with RBV and pegylated interferon for 12 weeks in genotypes 1, 4, 5 and 6.•We reported interim data from the Phase 2 LONESTAR study, which evaluated eight- and 12-week courses of therapy with the once-daily fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir with and without RBV. All patients in the 12-week arm achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR) four weeks after completing therapy and 40/41 patients achieved a SVR eight weeks after completing therapy. Two additional cohorts in the study evaluated a 12-week course of the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir with or without RBV in 40 patients who had previously failed therapy. Four weeks after completing therapy, 95% of patients in both arms achieved a SVR.•We announced plans to initiate a Phase 3 study called ION-3, which will evaluate eight- and 12-week therapies of our fixed-dose combination tablet of sofosbusvir/ledipasvir for the treatment of HCV infection with and without RBV and a 12-week therapy with RBV in non-cirrhotic, treatment-naive genotype 1 HCV-infected patients.•We announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated our Marketing Authorisation Application for sofosbuvir for the treatment of HCV which was submitted on April 17, 2013, and is now under assessment.HIV Program•The FDA issued complete response letters on our NDAs for elvitegravir and cobicistat for us as part of HIV treatment regimens. The letters noted that the FDA cannot approve the applications in their current form due to deficiencies in documentation and validation of certain observations noted during a recent inspection. We are addressing the agency's concerns to move the applications forward. The FDA did not raise any concerns with the safety profiles of elvitegravir and cobicistat.•The EMA granted marketing authorization for Stribild which allows for the marketing of our complete, once-daily single tablet regimen for HIV-1 infection for treatment-naïve adults across all 27 countries of the European Union.Oncology Program•We announced response data from a Phase 2 study (Study 101-08) evaluating idelalisib (formerly GS-1101) in treatment-naïve patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who achieved a complete response rate of 19% and an overall response rate of 97%, with estimated progression-free survival at 24 months of 93%. •We announced interim results from a single-arm, open-label Phase 2 study (Study 101-09) evaluating idelalisib for treatment of patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is non-responsive to rituximab and chemotherapy. In the study, single-agent treatment achieved an overall response rate of 54%, with a median duration of response at this interim analysis of 11.9 months.AcquisitionWe completed the acquisition of YM BioSciences Inc. (YM) for total consideration transferred of $487.6 million on February 8, 2013, at which time YM became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead. YM was a drug development company primarily focused on advancing momelotinib (formally known as CYT387), an orally administered, once-daily candidate for hematologic cancers. The purchase accounting is preliminary as management is awaiting data needed to finalize its review of the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. We expect to finalize the purchase accounting during the second half of 2013. The preliminary fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities include primarily in-process research and development (IPR&D) of $362.7 million, goodwill of $127.2 million, deferred tax liabilities of $108.8 million and cash acquired of $108.9 million. Pro forma results of operations for the acquisition of YM have not been presented because this acquisition is not material to our consolidated results of operations. See Note 7, Intangible Assets and Goodwill in our Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the IPR&D acquired.23Financial Highlights During the second quarter of 2013, total revenues increased 15% to $2.77 billion, compared to $2.41 billion in the second quarter of 2012, driven by higher underlying demand across all therapeutic areas, the continued expansion and uptake of our HIV portfolio and an increase in royalty revenues. Total product sales were $2.66 billion for the second quarter of 2013, an increase of 14% compared to the same period in 2012, due primarily to growth in our antiviral franchise, which increased 15% to $2.31 billion. Cardiovascular product sales, which include Letairis and Ranexa, totaled $234.9 million, an increase of 19% compared to the same period in 2012. Royalty revenues from our collaborations with corporate partners were $106.5 million, an increase of 31% compared to the prior year, due primarily to higher Tamiflu royalty revenues from Roche.Research and development (R&D) expenses increased 32% to $523.9 million for the second quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 as we continued to invest in our product pipeline, particularly in oncology and liver disease. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 22% to $405.0 million for the second quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to the ongoing growth and expansion of our business.Net income attributable to Gilead for the second quarter of 2013 increased 9% to $772.6 million or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to an increase in total revenues driven by underlying demand for our products partially offset by an increase in R&D and SG&A expenses.As of June 30, 2013, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.98 billion, an increase of $393.7 million compared to December 31, 2012. During the first half of 2013, we generated $1.63 billion of operating cash flows, repaid $929.6 million in debt, net of proceeds from convertible note hedges, and utilized $378.6 million for the acquisition of YM, net of cash acquired. Results of Operations Total Revenues Total revenues include product sales, royalty revenues, and contract and other revenues. Total revenues for three months ended June 30, 2013 were $2.77 billion, up 15% compared to $2.41 billion for the same period in 2012. Total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2013 were $5.30 billion, up 13% compared to $4.69 billion in the same period in 2012. Increases in total revenues for both periods were driven by growth in product sales and royalty revenues. Product Sales Total product sales were $2.66 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2013, an increase of 14% compared to the same period in 2012. Total product sales were $5.05 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013, an increase of 12% compared to the same period in 2012. Increases in product sales for both periods were driven by an increase in antiviral and cardiovascular product sales. Sequentially, total product sales increased 11% due primarily to increases in sales growth in the United States as sub-wholesalers increased inventories and higher levels of purchasing in Europe in advance of the summer holidays.Product sales in the United States increased by 20% and 15% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily driven by higher underlying demand for our antiviral products, specifically Complera and Stribild. Approximately 40% of our product sales are generated outside of the United States and as a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in euro. We used foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $21.0 million on our product sales for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and an unfavorable impact of $28.3 million on our product sales for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012.Product sales in Europe increased by 4% and 6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily driven by sales growth in our antiviral products, specifically Eviplera and Viread. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $20.7 million and $27.7 million on our European product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012. In light of the continued fiscal and debt crises experienced by several countries in the European Union, several governments have announced or implemented measures to manage healthcare expenditures. We continue to experience pricing pressure such as increases in the amount of discounts required on our products and delayed reimbursement which could negatively impact our future product sales and results of operations.24The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands):  Three Months Ended   Six Months Ended    June 30,   June 30,    2013 2012 Change 2013 2012 ChangeAntiviral products:            Atripla $938,108 $904,023 4 % $1,815,181 $1,791,619 1 %Truvada 807,779 785,933 3 % 1,508,021 1,544,196 (2)%Viread 250,188 215,414 16 % 460,520 407,107 13 %Complera/Eviplera 188,683 72,909 159 % 336,872 125,089 169 %Stribild 99,394 — — 191,542 — —Hepsera 21,456 26,191 (18)% 47,879 55,488 (14)%Emtriva 6,639 7,813 (15)% 13,310 14,590 (9)%Total antiviral products 2,312,247 2,012,283 15 % 4,373,325 3,938,089 11 %Letairis 128,257 101,634 26 % 246,364 188,922 30 %Ranexa 106,597 95,555 12 % 202,883 178,756 13 %AmBisome 75,137 83,653 (10)% 160,412 168,417 (5)%Other 35,047 28,115 25 % 67,869 55,398 23 %Total product sales $2,657,285 $2,321,240 14 % $5,050,853 $4,529,582 12 %Antiviral Products Antiviral product sales increased by 15% and 11% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 which reflects higher underlying demand for our new single-tablet regimen products, specifically Complera/Eviplera and Stribild. •Atripla Atripla sales increased by 4% and 1% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012, due to an increase in the average net selling price and sales volume. Atripla sales accounted for 41% and 42% of our total antiviral product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively. The efavirenz component of Atripla, which has a gross margin of zero, comprised $352.1 million of our Atripla sales for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and $680.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013. For the three months ended June 30, 2012, the efavirenz component of Atripla comprised $333.5 million of our Atripla sales and $659.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012.A generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's Sustiva (efavirenz), a component of our Atripla, is being made available in Europe and Canada in late 2013 and in the United States in 2014. As a result, we may start to observe a negative impact from competition on our future Atripla sales.•Truvada Truvada sales increased by 3% for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012, due to an increase in the average net selling price. Truvada sales decreased by 2% for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012, due primarily to declines in wholesaler and sub-wholesaler inventories in the United States during the first quarter of 2013, partially offset by the increase in the average net selling price during the second quarter of 2013. Truvada sales accounted for 35% and 34% of our total antiviral product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively. •Complera/EvipleraComplera/Eviplera sales increased by 159% and 169% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to sales growth in Europe and the United States.•StribildSales of Stribild were $99.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and $191.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013. Stribild was approved in the United States in August 2012 and Europe in May 2013.Cardiovascular ProductsCardiovascular product sales increased 19% and 22% during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily due to increases in underlying demand. During the three months ended June 2530, 2013, sales of Letairis increased by 26% and 30% during the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012. During the three months ended June 30, 2013, sales of Ranexa increased by 12% and 13% during the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012.Royalty Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands):   Three Months Ended   Six Months Ended    June 30,   June 30,    2013 2012 Change 2013 2012 ChangeRoyalty revenues $106,514 $81,106 31% $240,921 $152,211 58%Royalty revenues increased 31% for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 58% for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, due primarily to higher royalty revenues from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche) as a result of an increase in the number of patients treated for influenza with Tamiflu in the first quarter of 2013. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which the corresponding sales occur.Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross MarginThe following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin:   Three Months Ended   Six Months Ended    June 30,   June 30,    2013 2012 Change 2013 2012 ChangeTotal product sales $2,657,285 $2,321,240 14% $5,050,853 $4,529,582 12%Cost of goods sold $684,663 $617,345 11% $1,319,111 $1,198,276 10%Product gross margin 74% 74%   74% 74%  Our product gross margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 was 74%, remaining essentially flat as a percentage of total product sales when compared to the same periods in 2012.Research and Development Expenses   Three Months Ended   Six Months Ended    June 30,   June 30,  (In thousands, except percentages) 2013 2012 Change 2013 2012 ChangeResearch and development $523,902 $396,244 32% $1,021,534 $854,455 20%We manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business. R&D expenses summarized above consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. R&D expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2013 increased by $127.7 million or 32% compared to the same period in 2012, due primarily to $82.3 million related to an increase in clinical studies and $29.9 million related to personnel expenses to support the number of programs in late-stage development, specifically in oncology and liver disease. R&D expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2013 increased by $167.1 million or 20% compared to the same period in 2012, due primarily to a $176.2 million related to an increase in clinical studies and $65.3 million related to personnel expenses to support the number of programs in late-stage development, specifically in liver disease and oncology. These increases were partially offset by a $100.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense related to our acquisition of Pharmasset Inc. (Pharmasset) in January 2012.26Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   Three Months Ended   Six Months Ended    June 30,   June 30,  (In thousands, except percentages) 2013 2012 Change 2013 2012 ChangeSelling, general and administrative $404,991 $332,505 22% $779,287 $775,626 0%SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. Expenses are primarily comprised of facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses, and other general and administrative costs. SG&A expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2013 increased by $72.5 million or 22%, compared to the same period in 2012, due primarily to a $37.4 million increase in headcount related and other expenses to support the ongoing growth and expansion of our business and a $19.0 million increase in bad debt expense. In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded a net reduction in bad debt expense of $15.2 million following a factoring arrangement where we sold accounts receivable balances in Spain. We continue to monitor the macroeconomic environment, particularly in Southern Europe for collectability issues related to our outstanding receivables.SG&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2013 increased by $3.7 million, compared to the same period in 2012, due primarily to a $70.3 million increase in headcount related and other expenses to support the ongoing growth of our business. The total increase was partially offset by an $86.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, which included $98.0 million in stock-based compensation related to our acquisition of Pharmasset in January 2012.We expect SG&A expenses to increase through the remainder of 2013 as we build our commercial organization in preparation for the anticipated launch of sofosbuvir.Interest ExpenseInterest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2013 was $78.0 million, a decrease of $10.4 million compared to the same period in 2012. Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was $159.8 million, a decrease of $25.9 million compared to the same period in 2012. The decreases for both periods were primarily due to the maturity of our convertible senior notes due in May 2013 (May 2013 Notes), repayment of revolving credit facilities and conversions of our May 2013 Notes and senior convertible notes due in May 2014 (May 2014 Notes). Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 was not significant for both periods. Other income (expense), net for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was a net expense of $(3.6) million compared to a net expense of $(35.2) million for the same period in 2012, which included a $40.1 million loss on Greek bonds related to Greece's restructuring of its sovereign debt.Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $308.0 million and $530.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to $263.5 million and $494.8 million for the same periods in 2012, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 28.6% and 26.3% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to 27.2% and 30.2% for the same periods in 2012, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2013 was higher than the effective tax rate for the same period in 2012 due primarily to lower earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, offset by the extension of the 2013 federal research tax credit. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was lower than the effective tax rate for the same period in 2012 as a result of the retroactive extension of the 2012 and 2013 federal research tax credit in January 2013 and the stock-based compensation expense related to the Pharmasset acquisition for which we receive no tax benefit in the first quarter of 2012, offset by lower earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the retroactive extension of the 2012 and 2013 federal research tax credit in January 2013 and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes and our portion of the non-deductible pharmaceutical excise tax. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. In January 2013, the U.S. Congress passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which retroactively reinstated the federal research tax credit for 2012 and 2013. As a result, our income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 included a discrete tax benefit related to the federal research tax credit for 2012.27Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the periods presented (in thousands):    June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $2,975,798 $2,582,086Working capital $2,135,391 $1,886,327  Six Months Ended  June 30,  2013 2012Cash provided by (used in):    Operating activities $1,625,105 $1,743,620Investing activities $(462,733) $(11,378,080)Financing activities $(756,649) $1,380,711Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities As of June 30, 2013, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.98 billion, an increase of $393.7 million or 15% from December 31, 2012. During the six months ended June 30, 2013, we generated $1.63 billion in cash flows from operations, repaid $929.6 million in debt, net of proceeds from convertible note hedges, and utilized $378.6 million for the acquisition of YM, net of cash acquired.Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at June 30, 2013, approximately $1.33 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. We do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity in the United States to fund our domestic operational and strategic needs. Working Capital Working capital was $2.14 billion at June 30, 2013. The increase of $249.1 million in working capital from December 31, 2012 was primarily due to an increase of $398.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $190.2 million in inventories, partially offset by an increase in the current portion of long-term debt, net. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $1.63 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily related to net income of $1.49 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $147.5 million of depreciation and amortization expenses and $117.7 million of stock-based compensation expenses. This was partially offset by $161.9 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities.Cash provided by operating activities of $1.74 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2012 primarily related to net income of $1.14 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $133.6 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $97.1 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $350.9 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operations included the impact of the $193.9 million in stock-based compensation expense related to Pharmasset and $349.7 million of proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable balances in Spain. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was $462.7 million, consisting primarily of $378.6 million used in our acquisition of YM, net of the cash acquired.Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2012 was $11.38 billion, consisting primarily of $10.75 billion used in our acquisition of Pharmasset, net of stock-based compensation expense and cash acquired. 28Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was $756.6 million, driven primarily by $2.14 billion used to repay debt financing which includes the maturity and conversions of our May 2014 Notes and our senior convertible notes due in May 2016 (May 2016 Notes), partially offset by net proceeds of $1.21 billion related to our convertible note hedges and proceeds of $146.3 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans.Cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2012 was $1.38 billion, driven primarily by net proceeds of $2.14 billion from the issuance of bank debt in conjunction with the Pharmasset acquisition and proceeds of $201.8 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. The cash proceeds were partially offset by the $700.0 million used to repay bank debt during the quarter and $261.8 million used to repurchase our common stock under our January 2011 stock repurchase program, including commissions. Long-Term Obligations The following is a summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements (in thousands): Type of Borrowing Description Issue Date Due Date Interest Rate June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Convertible Senior May 2013 Notes April 2006 May 2013 0.625% $— $419,433Convertible Senior May 2014 Notes July 2010 May 2014 1.00% 888,170 1,210,213Convertible Senior May 2016 Notes July 2010 May 2016 1.625% 1,162,018 1,157,692Senior Unsecured April 2021 Notes March 2011 April 2021 4.50% 993,352 992,923Senior Unsecured December 2014 Notes December 2011 December 2014 2.40% 749,552 749,394Senior Unsecured December 2016 Notes December 2011 December 2016 3.05% 699,210 699,095Senior Unsecured December 2021 Notes December 2011 December 2021 4.40% 1,247,573 1,247,428Senior Unsecured December 2041 Notes December 2011 December 2041 5.65% 997,847 997,810Credit Facility Five-Year Revolver January 2012 January 2017 Variable 600,000 750,000Total debt, net $7,337,722 $8,223,988Less current portion 1,488,170 1,169,433Total long-term debt, net $5,849,552 $7,054,555In January 2012, in conjunction with our acquisition of Pharmasset, we entered into a five-year $1.25 billion revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement), a $750.0 million short-term revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement) and a $1.00 billion term loan facility (the Term Loan Credit Agreement). We borrowed $750.0 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, $400.0 million under the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and $1.00 billion under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, upon the close of the acquisition. In 2012, we fully repaid the outstanding debt under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement, at which time both agreements terminated. During the six months ended June 30, 2013, we repaid $150.0 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement.The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and events of default. The loan bears interest at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the credit agreement. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay the loan in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit agreement and notes indentures and as of June 30, 2013, we were in compliance with all such covenants.Maturity of 2013 Convertible Senior NotesDuring the six months ended June 30, 2013, a portion of our May 2013 Notes were converted and on May 1, 2013, the remainder matured. We repaid an aggregate principal balance of $426.3 million and $714.0 million in cash related to the conversion spread, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. We received $714.0 million in cash from the related convertible note hedges. Warrants related to our May 2013 Notes expired in August 2013 and we expect to pay approximately $1.04 billion to settle the warrants as the average market price of our common stock exceeded the warrants' exercise price.29Convertible Senior NotesDuring the six months ended June 30, 2013, a portion of our May 2014 Notes and May 2016 Notes was converted. We repaid $353.0 million of the principal balance, primarily composed of May 2014 Notes. We also paid $492.0 million in cash related to the conversion spread of the notes, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $492.0 million in cash from our convertible note hedges related to these notes.Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and JudgmentsThere have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments during the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn February 2013, the FASB also issued an update to the existing standard for liabilities. The update provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements. For obligations for which the total amount is fixed at the reporting date, an entity will be required to measure those obligations as the sum of the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. Such entities will also be required to disclose the nature, amount and other significant information about the obligations. This guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2014. We are evaluating the financial statement impact of this guidance. Currently, we do not expect that adopting this update will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 30ITEM 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThere have been no material changes in our market risk during the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. As of June 30, 2013, our accounts receivable in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $891.2 million, of which $383.8 million were greater than 120 days past due and $135.4 million were greater than 365 days past due. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate at June 30, 2013. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to our collection of accounts receivable. However, we will continue to monitor the European economic environment for collectability issues related to our outstanding receivables. ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation as of June 30, 2013 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at June 30, 2013.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2013, and has concluded that there was no change during such quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Limitations on the Effectiveness of ControlsA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met and, as set forth above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system were met.31PART II.OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Litigation with Generic ManufacturersTenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate, Emtricitabine and Fixed-dose Combination of Emtricitabine, Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate and EfavirenzIn November 2008, we received notice that Teva Pharmaceuticals (Teva) submitted an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Truvada. In the notice, Teva alleges that two of the patents associated with emtricitabine, owned by Emory University and licensed exclusively to us, are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva's manufacture, use or sale of a generic fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In December 2008, we filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents. In March 2009, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and efavirenz. In the notice, Teva challenged the same two emtricitabine patents. In May 2009, we filed another lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents, and this lawsuit was consolidated with the lawsuit filed in December 2008. In January 2010, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Viread. In the notice, Teva challenged four of the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate patents protecting Viread. In January 2010, we also received notices from Teva amending its ANDAs related to generic versions of our Atripla and Truvada products. In the notice related to Teva's ANDA for a generic version of Atripla, Teva challenged four patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, two additional patents related to emtricitabine and two patents related to efavirenz. In the notice related to Teva's ANDA for a generic version of Truvada, Teva challenged four patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and two additional patents related to emtricitabine. In March 2010, we filed lawsuits against Teva for infringement of the four Viread patents and two additional emtricitabine patents. In March 2010, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Merck & Co., Inc. filed a lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the patents related to efavirenz. Because we filed our lawsuits within the requisite 45 day period provided in the Hatch Waxman Act, there were stays preventing FDA approval of Teva's ANDAs for 30 months or until a district court decision adverse to the patents. The 30-month stay for all three Teva ANDAs expired in July 2012. In April 2013, we and Teva reached an agreement to settle the ongoing patent litigation concerning the four patents that protect tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in our Atripla, Truvada and Viread products. Under the agreement, Teva will be allowed to launch a generic version of Viread on December 15, 2017. The settlement agreement was filed and is under review by the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice. In November 2011, we received notice that Teva submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS) to the Canadian Ministry of Health requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In the notice, Teva alleges that three of the patents associated with Truvada are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In January 2012, we filed a lawsuit against Teva in Canadian Federal Court seeking an order of prohibition against approval of this ANDS. This lawsuit is currently scheduled for hearing in September 2013. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining the order of prohibition and Teva receives approval of their product, Teva will be able to launch generic version of our Truvada product “at risk” before expiry of our patents upon approval of their ANDS.In December 2011, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDS to the Canadian Ministry of Health requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and efavirenz. In the notice, Teva alleges that three of our patents associated with Atripla and two of Merck's patents associated with Atripla are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva's manufacture, use or sale of a generic fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and efavirenz. In February 2012, we filed a lawsuit against Teva in Canadian Federal Court seeking an order of prohibition against approval of this ANDS. In July 2012, we received notice that Lupin Limited (Lupin) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Truvada. In the notice, Lupin alleges that four patents associated with emtricitabine and four patents associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Lupin's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In August 2012, we filed a lawsuit against Lupin in U.S. District Court in New York for infringement of our patents. 32In July 2012, we received notice that Cipla Ltd. (Cipla) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Emtriva and a generic version of Viread. In the notice, Cipla alleges that two patents associated with emtricitabine are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Cipla's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of emtricitabine and four patents associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Cipla's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In August 2012, we filed lawsuits against Cipla in U.S. District Court in New York for infringement of our patents. In August 2012, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDS to the Canadian Ministry of Health requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In the notice, Teva alleges that two patents associated with Viread are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Viread. In September 2012, we filed a lawsuit against Teva in Canadian Federal Court seeking an order of prohibition against approval of this ANDS. Also in August 2012, Teva filed an Impeachment Action in Canadian Federal Court seeking invalidation of our two Canadian patents associated with Viread. We are currently defending that Impeachment Action. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining the order of prohibition in connection with Teva's ANDS for Truvada, Teva will be able to launch a generic version of our Truvada and Viread products “at risk” before expiry of our Canadian patents, assuming their generic product is approved.In October 2012, we received notice that Lupin submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Viread. In the notice, Lupin alleges that four patents associated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Lupin's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In October 2012, we filed a lawsuit against Lupin in U.S. District Court in New York for infringement of our patents. Ranolazine In June 2010, we received notice that Lupin submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of sustained release ranolazine. In the notice, Lupin alleges that ten of the patents associated with Ranexa are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Lupin's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Ranexa. In July 2010, we filed a lawsuit against Lupin in U.S. District Court in New Jersey for infringement of our patents for Ranexa. The FDA cannot approve Lupin's ANDA until we receive a district court decision or upon the expiration of the court's automatic stay in July 2013. The trial took place in April and May 2013. The court has not yet issued a decision. We do not anticipate a launch of a generic version of Ranexa by Lupin before the court has had an opportunity to issue its decision in the patent litigation. If necessary, we expect to have the opportunity to seek a preliminary injunction to prevent an unauthorized launch of a generic version of Ranexa by Lupin. If the court finds that none of the patents that protect our Ranexa formulation are infringed and/or that all are invalid and Lupin receives final approval of their product, Lupin will be able to launch generic version of our Ranexa product “at risk” upon issuance of that decision.Adefovir disoproxil fumarateIn August 2010, we received notice that Sigmapharm Labs (Sigmapharm) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic adefovir dipivoxil. In the notice, Sigmapharm alleges that both of the patents associated with Hepsera are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Sigmapharm's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Hepsera. In September 2010, we filed a lawsuit against Sigmapharm in U.S. District Court in New Jersey for infringement of our patents. As a result of the recent invalidation of the patents protecting entecavir, which is also approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, and due to declining sales of Hepsera in the United States, in March 2013, we granted Sigmapharm a Covenant Not to Sue for the patents associated with Hepsera and filed a motion to dismiss all claims in the lawsuit. FDA may approve Sigmapharm's product whenever it finds that the product meets the requirements for approval. Once Sigmapharm obtains FDA approval of its product, it may launch its generic product.One of the patents challenged by Sigmapharm was also challenged by Ranbaxy, Inc. (Ranbaxy) pursuant to a notice received in October 2010. The patent challenged by Ranbaxy expires in July 2018. We do not anticipate filing a lawsuit against Ranbaxy.TamifluIn February 2011, we received notice that Natco Pharma Ltd. (Natco) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic oseltamivir phosphate. In the notice, Natco alleges that one of the patents associated with Tamiflu is invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Natco's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Tamiflu. In March 2011, we and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (Roche) filed a lawsuit against Natco in U.S. District Court in New Jersey for infringement of one of the patents associated with Tamiflu. In December 2012, the court issued a ruling in favor of Gilead and Roche, that our patent is not invalid for the reasons stated in Natco's notice letter. Natco has appealed this decision.33We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, and we may spend significant resources enforcing and defending these patents. If we are unsuccessful in these lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva, Ranexa and Tamiflu in the United States and Atripla, Truvada and Viread in Canada could be substantially shortened. Further, if all of the patents covering one or more products are invalidated, the FDA or Canadian Ministry of Health could approve the requests to manufacture a generic version of such products in the United States or Canada, respectively, prior to the expiration date of those patents. The sale of generic versions of these products earlier than their patent expiration would have a significant negative effect on our revenues and results of operations.Department of Justice InvestigationIn June 2011, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California requesting documents related to the manufacture, and related quality and distribution practices, of Complera, Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera and Letairis. We have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with this governmental inquiry.Interference Proceedings and Litigation with Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.In February 2012, we received notice that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) had declared an Interference between our U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572 and Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s (Idenix) pending patent application no. 12/131868. An Interference is an administrative proceeding before the PTO designed to determine who was the first to invent the subject matter being claimed by both parties. Our patent covers metabolites of sofosbuvir and RG7128. Idenix is attempting to claim a class of compounds, including these metabolites, in its pending patent application. In the course of this proceeding, both parties will be called upon to submit evidence of the date they conceived of their respective inventions. The Interference will determine who was first to invent these compounds and therefore who is entitled to the patent claiming these compounds. In March 2013, the PTO Patent Trials and Appeal Board (the Board) determined that Idenix is not entitled to the benefit of any of its early application filing dates because none of those patent applications taught how to make the compounds in dispute. The Board also determined that we are entitled to the filing date of our earliest application. As a result, the Board determined that we were first to file the patent application on the compounds in dispute and we are therefore the “senior party” in the interference. In the second phase of the interference, the Board will determine who was first to invent the compounds. The party who is deemed first to invent will prevail in the Interference. Idenix bears the burden of establishing that despite its much later patent application filing date, they were nevertheless first to invent the compounds in dispute. In order to prove they were first to invent, Idenix must prove that it was first to conceive of a compound within the scope of those in dispute, namely that (1) the named inventors had identified the structure, a method of making and a use for a disputed compound and (2) that Idenix worked diligently from its earliest conception date until it made and tested the compound or filed its application in 2008.If the Board determines that Idenix was first to invent and is entitled to these patent claims and it is determined that we have infringed those claims, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Idenix to commercialize sofosbuvir and RG7128. Any determination by the Board can be appealed by either party to U.S. Federal Court. We believe the Idenix application involved in the Interference and similar U.S. and foreign patents claiming the same compounds and metabolites are invalid. As a result, we filed an Impeachment Action in Canadian Federal Court to invalidate the Idenix CA2490191 patent, which is the Canadian patent that corresponds to the Idenix U.S. Patent No. 7608600 and the Idenix patent application that is the subject of the Interference. Idenix has now asserted that our Canadian Patent No. 2527657, corresponding to the '572 patent in the Interference, is invalid. We filed a similar legal action in the Federal Court of Norway seeking to invalidate Idenix's corresponding Norwegian patent. We filed a similar legal action in the Federal Court of Australia seeking to invalidate the corresponding Australian patent. We may bring similar action in other countries in 2013. Idenix has not been awarded patents on these compounds in European countries, Japan or China. In the event such patents issue, we expect to challenge them in proceedings similar to those we invoked in Canada, Norway and Australia. Arbitration with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd and Hoffman-La Roche Inc.Gilead (as successor to Pharmasset, Inc. (Pharmasset)) is a party to an October 29, 2004 collaboration agreement with Roche and Hoffman-La Roche Inc. The agreement granted Roche rights to develop PSI-6130, a cytidine analog, and its prodrugs, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The collaborative research efforts under the agreement ended on December 31, 2006. Roche later asked Pharmasset to consider whether Roche may have contributed to the inventorship of sofosbuvir and whether Pharmasset has complied with the confidentiality provisions of the collaboration agreement. Pharmasset advised us that it carefully considered the issues raised by Roche and that it believed any such issues are without merit. We have also considered these issues and reached the same conclusion. In March 2013, Roche initiated an arbitration against us and Pharmasset, predecessor to Gilead Pharmasset LLC, regarding the collaboration agreement. In the demand, Roche asserts that it has an exclusive license to sofosbuvir pursuant to the collaboration agreement because sofosbuvir, a prodrug of a uridine monophosphate analog, is allegedly a prodrug of PSI-6130. Roche further claims that, because it has exclusive rights to sofosbuvir, it also has an exclusive license to a patent covering sofosbuvir, and that we will infringe that 34patent by selling and offering for sale products containing sofosbuvir. Gilead and Gilead Pharmasset LLC filed their response to Roche's demand in April 2013. We believe Roche's claim is without merit. However, if Roche were to successfully establish exclusive rights to sofosbuvir, our expected revenues and earnings from the sale of sofosbuvir could be adversely affected.Contract Arbitration with Jeremy ClarkIn March 2012, Jeremy Clark, a former employee of Pharmasset, which we acquired in January 2012, and inventor of U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572, filed a demand for arbitration in his lawsuit against Pharmasset and Dr. Raymond Schinazi. Mr. Clark initially filed the lawsuit against Pharmasset and Dr. Schinazi in Alabama District Court in February 2008 seeking to void the assignment provision in his employment agreement and assert ownership of U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572, which claims metabolites of sofosbuvir and RG7128. In December 2008, the court ordered a stay of the litigation pending the outcome of an arbitration proceeding required by Mr. Clark's employment agreement. Instead of proceeding with arbitration, Mr. Clark filed two additional lawsuits in September 2009 and June 2010, both of which were subsequently dismissed by the court. In September 2010, Mr. Clark filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the court's December 2008 order which was denied by the court. In December 2011, Mr. Clark filed a motion to appoint a special prosecutor. In February 2012, the Alabama Court issued an order requiring Mr. Clark to enter arbitration or risk dismissal of his case. Mr. Clark filed a demand for arbitration in March 2012. The arbitration panel held a hearing in April 2013. In June 2013, the arbitration panel issued its decision in favor of Pharmasset (now Gilead) and Dr. Schinazi.Other Matters We are a party to various legal actions that arose in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that these other legal actions will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated business, financial position or results of operations. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. A manifestation of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and, therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. The public announcement of data from clinical studies evaluating sofosbuvir and the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir in HCV-infected patients is likely to cause significant volatility in our stock price. If the development or approval of sofosbuvir alone or in combination with ledipasvir is delayed or discontinued, our stock price could decline significantly. During 2013, we have received, and we expect to continue to receive, a significant amount of data from clinical trials evaluating sofosbuvir, an investigational nucleotide analog we acquired through our purchase of Pharmasset, Inc. (Pharmasset), alone or in combination with other direct acting antivirals in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected individuals across all genotypes.In April 2013, we filed a new drug application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for sofosbuvir. The data submitted in this NDA support the use of sofosbuvir and ribavirin (RBV) as an all-oral therapy for patients with genotype 2 and 3 HCV infection, and of sofosbuvir in combination with RBV and peg-IFN for treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6 HCV infection. In May 2013, our marketing application for the use of sofosbuvir and RBV and sofosbuvir in combination with RBV and peg-IFN for the treatment of HCV in the same patient populations was validated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). There is risk that the FDA and EMA may not approve sofosbuvir in a timely manner or at all, and that any marketing approval, if granted, may have significant limitations on their use. In parallel, we are also advancing a fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (formerly GS-5885) for the treatment of genotype 1 patients. Our NDA for the fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir will be supported by two clinical trials. The first study, named ION-1, evaluates the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir with and without RBV for either 12 or 24 weeks in treatment-naïve genotype 1 infected patients. In the second quarter of 2013, we completed enrollment of remaining patients in the ION-1 study to assess the fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir. In March 2013, we also completed enrollment of patients in a Phase 3 study, named ION-2, evaluating the fixed-dose combination with RBV for 12 weeks and with and without RBV for 24 weeks of therapy among treatment-experienced genotype 1 HCV patients.We are also conducting a Phase 2 study, named LONESTAR, evaluating sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for 12 weeks and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir with and without RBV for 8 weeks among genotype 1 treatment-naïve patients. Two additional arms in this trial will evaluate sofosbuvir/ledipasvir with and without RBV for 12 weeks among treatment-experienced genotype 1 patients who had previously received a protease inhibitor-containing regimen. Based on interim data from the Phase 2 LONESTAR study, in June 2013, we completed enrollment of patients in a Phase 3 study, named ION-3, evaluating the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for eight weeks with and without RBV and for 12 weeks without RBV in 600 non-35cirrhotic, treatment-naïve genotype 1 HCV-infected patients. We expect to file for marketing approval of the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced genotype 1 patients in the second quarter of 2014.The announcement of data from our clinical studies evaluating sofosbuvir and the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir is likely to cause significant volatility in our stock price. The announcement of any negative or unexpected data or the discontinuation of development of sofosbuvir or the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir or any delay in our anticipated timelines for obtaining regulatory approval in the United States or European Union will likely cause our stock price to decline significantly.A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales of our HIV products, particularly Atripla and Truvada. If we are unable to maintain or continue increasing sales of these products, our results of operations may be adversely affected. We are currently dependent on sales of our products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, particularly Atripla and Truvada, to support our existing operations. Our HIV products contain tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and/or emtricitabine, which belong to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. Were the treatment paradigm for HIV to change, causing nucleoside-based therapeutics to fall out of favor, or if we were unable to maintain or continue increasing our HIV product sales, our results of operations would likely suffer and we would likely need to scale back our operations, including our spending on research and development (R&D) efforts. For the quarter ended June 30, 2013, Atripla and Truvada product sales together were $1.75 billion, or 63% of our total revenues. We may not be able to sustain or increase the growth rate of sales of our HIV products, especially Stribild, Complera/Eviplera, Atripla and Truvada, for any number of reasons including, but not limited to, the following: •As our HIV products are used over a longer period of time in many patients and in combination with other products, and additional studies are conducted, new issues with respect to safety, resistance and interactions with other drugs may arise, which could cause us to provide additional warnings or contraindications on our labels, narrow our approved indications or halt sales of a product, each of which could reduce our revenues. •As our HIV products mature, private insurers and government payers often reduce the amount they will reimburse patients for these products, which increases pressure on us to reduce prices. •A large part of the market for our HIV products consists of patients who are already taking other HIV drugs. If we are not successful in encouraging physicians to change patients' regimens to include our HIV products, the sales of our HIV products will be limited. •As generic HIV products are introduced into major markets, our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected. For example, we currently also expect competition from a generic version of Sustiva (efavirenz), a component of our Atripla, to be available in Europe and Canada in late 2013 and the United States in 2014, which may negatively impact sales of our HIV products.If we fail to commercialize new products or expand the indications for existing products, our prospects for future revenues may be adversely affected. If we do not introduce new products to market or increase sales of our existing products, we will not be able to increase or maintain our total revenues and continue to expand our R&D efforts. Drug development is inherently risky and many product candidates fail during the drug development process. For example, in April 2013, we announced our decision to terminate our Phase 3 clinical trial of aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of bronchiectasis. In addition, our NDAs for elvitegravir for the treatment of HIV in treatment-experienced patients; cobicistat, a pharmacoenhancing or “boosting” agent, and sofosbuvir for the treatment of HCV may not be approved by the FDA, EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities on a timely basis, or at all. Even if marketing approval is granted for the product, there may be significant limitations on their use. Further, we may be unable to file our marketing applications for new products, including the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir or idelalisib for the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the currently anticipated timelines and marketing approval for the products may not be granted. Because Congress did not agree to a package of tax and federal spending proposals on January 1, 2013, an automatic reduction in federal spending or “sequestration” took effect on March 1, 2013. Under sequestration, across-the-board cuts have been implemented, which may negatively effect the operations of governmental agencies, including the FDA. As a result, the FDA may be unable to review and approve NDAs in the currently anticipated timelines. Any significant delay in the timing of our anticipated product approvals may reduce our anticipated future revenue and earnings and could negatively affect our stock price.36Our results of operations will be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reforms. Legislative and regulatory changes to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In March 2010, healthcare reform legislation was adopted in the United States. As a result, we are required to further rebate or discount products reimbursed or paid for by various public payers, including Medicaid and other entities eligible to purchase discounted products through the 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Service Act, such as AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs). As a result of the 2010 legislation, the discounts, rebates and fees that impacted us include: •our minimum base rebate amount owed to Medicaid on products reimbursed by Medicaid increased by 8%, and the discounts or rebates we owe to ADAPs and other Public Health Service entities which reimburse or purchase our products also increased by 8%; •we are required to extend rebates to patients receiving our products through Medicaid managed care organizations; •we are required to provide a 50% discount on products sold to patients while they are in the Medicare Part D “donut hole;” and •we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, were required to pay a portion of a new industry fee (also known as the pharmaceutical excise tax) of $2.8 billion for 2012, calculated based on select government sales during the 2010 calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales. The amount of the industry fee imposed on the pharmaceutical industry as a whole increased to $2.8 billion in 2012 and 2013, with additional increases over the next several years to a peak of $4.1 billion per year in 2018, and then decrease to $2.8 billion in 2019 and thereafter. As the amount of the industry fee increases, our product sales increase and drug patents expire on major drugs of other companies, we expect our portion of the excise tax to increase as well. We estimate our portion of the pharmaceutical excise tax to be approximately $100-$120 million in 2013, compared to approximately $85 million in 2012. The excise tax is not tax deductible. Further, even though not addressed in the healthcare reform legislation, discussions continue at the federal level on legislation that would either allow or require the federal government to directly negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers or set minimum requirements for Medicare Part D pricing. In addition, state Medicaid programs could request additional supplemental rebates on our products as a result of the increase in the federal base Medicaid rebate. Private insurers could also use the enactment of these increased rebates to exert pricing pressure on our products, and to the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow Medicaid coverage and payment developments, the adverse effects may be magnified by private insurers adopting lower payment schedules.Our existing products are subject to reimbursement from government agencies and other third parties. Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressures may reduce profitability. Successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of governmental and third-party payer reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement. In the United States, the European Union and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. A significant portion of our sales of the majority of our products are subject to significant discounts from list price and rebate obligations. In the United States, state ADAPs, which purchase a significant portion of our HIV products, rely on federal, supplemental federal and state funding to help fund purchases of our products. Given the current economic downturn, we have experienced a shift in our payer mix as patients previously covered by private insurance move to public reimbursement programs that require rebates or discounts from us or as patients previously covered by one public reimbursement program move to another public reimbursement program that requires greater rebates or discounts from us. As a result of this shift, revenue growth may be lower than prescription growth. Effective March 1, 2013, an automatic reduction in federal spending or “sequestration” is in effect. Under sequestration, across-the-board cuts have been implemented which could reduce the amount of federal and state funds to support ADAP programs. If federal and state funds are not available in amounts sufficient to support the number of patients that rely on ADAPs, sales of our HIV products could be negatively impacted which would reduce our revenues. For example, during the first quarter of 2011, the state budget crisis in Florida led to a temporary movement of patients who were previously covered by Florida's ADAP into industry-supported patient assistance programs. In prior quarters, because of the insufficiency of federal and state funds and as many states reduced eligibility criteria, we saw an increase in the number of patients on state ADAP wait lists, and we may see similar increases in future periods as a result of any reduction in federal and state ADAP support resulting from the sequestration. Until these patients are enrolled in ADAP, they generally receive product from industry-supported patient assistance programs or are unable to access treatment. The increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely 37affect our product sales and profitability. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. In Europe, the success of our commercialized products, and any other product candidates we may develop, will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because in many European countries patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In addition, negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization by 12 months or more. Reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. In many international markets, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals, including through the implementation of reference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes and profit control, and they expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as volumes increase. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on our products, and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. For example, in June 2010, Spain imposed an incremental discount on all branded drugs and in August 2010, Germany increased the rebate on prescription pharmaceuticals. As generic drugs come to market, we may face price decreases for our products in some countries in the European Union. Further, cost containment pressures in the European Union, especially in Southern Europe, could lead to delays in the treatment of patients and also delay pricing approval, which could negatively impact the commercialization of new products.Approximately 40% of our product sales occur outside the United States, and currency fluctuations and hedging expenses may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price. Because a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative value of such sales increases. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. We use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. We cannot predict future fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate of the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly against certain currencies and our hedging program does not sufficiently offset the effects of such appreciation, our results of operations will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline. Additionally, the expenses that we recognize in relation to our hedging activities can also cause our earnings to fluctuate. The level of hedging expenses that we recognize in a particular period is impacted by the changes in interest rate spreads between the foreign currencies that we hedge and the U.S. dollar.Our inability to accurately estimate demand for our products, as well as sales fluctuations as a result of inventory levels held by wholesalers, pharmacies and non-retail customers make it difficult for us to accurately forecast sales and may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our financial results and our stock price. In quarter ended June 30, 2013, approximately 79% of our product sales in the United States were to three wholesalers, Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corp. and AmerisourceBergen Corp. The U.S. wholesalers with whom we have entered into inventory management agreements make estimates to determine end user demand and may not be completely effective in matching their inventory levels to actual end user demand. As a result, changes in inventory levels held by those wholesalers can cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to these wholesalers do not match end user demand. In addition, inventory is held at retail pharmacies and other non-wholesale locations with whom we have no inventory management agreements and no control over buying patterns. Adverse changes in economic conditions or other factors may cause retail pharmacies to reduce their inventories of our products, which would reduce their orders from wholesalers and, consequently, the wholesalers' orders from us, even if end user demand has not changed. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2012, our wholesalers increased their inventory levels for our antiviral products. In the first quarter of 2013, our wholesalers drew down on their inventory such that inventory levels for our antiviral products moved to the lower end of the contractual boundaries set by our inventory management agreements. As inventory in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter, we may continue to see fluctuations in our earnings and a mismatch between prescription demand for our products and our revenues38In addition, the non-retail sector in the United States, which includes government institutions, including state ADAPs, correctional facilities and large health maintenance organizations, tends to be even less consistent in terms of buying patterns and often causes quarter over quarter fluctuations that do not necessarily mirror patient demand. Federal and state budget pressures, including sequestration, as well as the annual grant cycles for federal and state ADAP funds, may cause ADAP purchasing patterns to not reflect patient demand. For example, similar to first quarters of prior years, in the first quarter of 2013, we observed large non-retail purchases by a number of state ADAPs which exceeded patient demand. We believe such purchases were driven by the grant cycle for federal ADAP funds. Given the uncertainty about the timing and amount of federal funding for ADAP for the 2013 year, we expect to see reduced purchasing by ADAPs until the Ryan White Funds are fully communicated. As a result, we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the purchasing patterns of our non-retail customers which may result in fluctuations in our product sales, revenues and earnings in the future. In light of the global economic downturn and budget crises faced by many European countries, we have observed variations in purchasing patterns induced by cost containment measures in Europe. We believe these measures have caused some government agencies and other purchasers to reduce inventory of our products in the distribution channels, which has decreased our revenues and caused fluctuations in our product sales and earnings. We may continue to see this trend in the future.We face significant competition. We face significant competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, most of whom have substantially greater resources than we do. In addition, our competitors have more products and have operated in the fields in which we compete for longer than we have. Our HIV products compete primarily with products from the joint venture established by GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK) and Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) which markets fixed-dose combination products that compete with Stribild, Complera/Eviplera, Atripla and Truvada. For example, lamivudine, marketed by this joint venture, is competitive with emtricitabine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Emtriva and a component of Complera/Eviplera, Atripla and Truvada. We also face competition from generic HIV products. In May 2010, the compound patent covering Epivir (lamivudine) itself expired in the United States, and generic lamivudine is now available in the United States, Spain, Portugal and Italy. We expect that generic versions of lamivudine will be launched in other countries within the European Union. In May 2011, a generic version of Combivir (lamivudine and zidovudine) was approved and was recently launched in the United States. In addition, in late 2011, generic tenofovir also became available in Turkey, which resulted in an increase in the rebate for Viread in Turkey. We currently also expect competition from a generic version of Sustiva (efavirenz), a component of our Atripla, to be available in Europe and Canada in late 2013 and the United States in 2014, which may negatively impact sales of our HIV products. We also expect the launch of dolutegravir, an integrase inhibitor, in the fourth quarter of 2013 by GSK which could impact the sales of our HIV products.For Viread and Hepsera for treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), we compete primarily with products produced by GSK, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Novartis) in the United States, the European Union and China. For AmBisome, we compete primarily with products produced by Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) and Pfizer. In addition, we are aware of at least three lipid formulations that claim similarity to AmBisome becoming available outside of the United States, including the possible entry of such formulations in Greece and Taiwan. These formulations may reduce market demand for AmBisome. Furthermore, the manufacture of lipid formulations of amphotericin B is very complex and if any of these formulations are found to be unsafe, sales of AmBisome may be negatively impacted by association. Letairis competes directly with a product produced by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. and indirectly with pulmonary arterial hypertension products from United Therapeutics Corporation and Pfizer. Ranexa competes predominantly with generic compounds from three distinct classes of drugs, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates for the treatment of chronic angina in the United States. Cayston competes with a product marketed by Novartis. Tamiflu competes with products sold by GSK and generic competitors. In addition, a number of companies are pursuing the development of technologies which are competitive with our existing products or research programs. These competing companies include specialized pharmaceutical firms and large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently or together with other pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs. If significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates, our future sales may be reduced, which would adversely affect our results of operations. The data supporting the marketing approvals for our products and forming the basis for the safety warnings in our product labels were obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration and, in some cases, from post-approval use. As our products are used over longer periods of time by many patients with underlying health problems, taking numerous other medicines, we expect to continue to find new issues such as safety, resistance or drug interaction issues, which may require us to provide 39additional warnings or contraindications on our labels or narrow our approved indications, each of which could reduce the market acceptance of these products. Our product Letairis, which was approved by the FDA in June 2007, is a member of a class of compounds called endothelin receptor antagonists which pose specific risks, including serious risks of birth defects. Because of these risks, Letairis is available only through the Letairis Education and Access Program (LEAP), a restricted distribution program intended to help physicians and patients learn about the risks associated with the product and assure appropriate use of the product. As the product is used by additional patients, we may discover new risks associated with Letairis which may result in changes to the distribution program and additional restrictions on the use of Letairis which may decrease demand for the product. Regulatory authorities have been moving towards more active and transparent pharmacovigilance and are making greater amounts of stand-alone safety information directly available to the public through websites and other means, e.g. periodic safety update report summaries, risk management plan summaries and various adverse event data. Safety information, without the appropriate context and expertise, may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action which may potentially cause our product sales or stock price to decline. Further, if serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues arise with our marketed products, sales of these products could be limited or halted by us or by regulatory authorities and our results of operations would be adversely affected.Our operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products. The products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the EMA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We are continuing clinical trials for Stribild, Complera/Eviplera, Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva, Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Cayston for currently approved and additional uses. We anticipate that we will file for marketing approval in additional countries and for additional indications and products over the next several years. These products may fail to receive such marketing approvals on a timely basis, or at all. Further, our marketed products and how we manufacture and sell these products are subject to extensive regulation and review. Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing or promotional activities may result in restrictions on our products, including withdrawal of the products from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those related to promotion and manufacturing, we could be subject to penalties including fines, suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products and criminal prosecution. For example, under FDA rules, we are often required to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk and implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for our products, which could include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to healthcare providers or other elements as the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the drug, which could include imposing certain restrictions on the distribution or use of a product. Failure to comply with these or other requirements, if imposed on a sponsor by the FDA, could result in significant civil monetary penalties and our operating results may be adversely affected. The results and anticipated timelines of our clinical trials are uncertain and may not support continued development of a product pipeline, which would adversely affect our prospects for future revenue growth. We are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of products that we develop for each intended use through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials. The results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. Even successfully completed large-scale clinical trials may not result in marketable products. If any of our product candidates fails to achieve its primary endpoint in clinical trials, if safety issues arise or if the results from our clinical trials are otherwise inadequate to support regulatory approval of our product candidates, commercialization of that product candidate could be delayed or halted. For example, in April 2013, we announced our decision to terminate our Phase 3 clinical trial of aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of bronchiectasis. In addition, we may also face challenges in clinical trial protocol design. If the clinical trials for any of the product candidates in our pipeline are delayed or terminated, our prospects for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted. For example, we face numerous risks and uncertainties with our product candidates, including sofosbuvir and the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for the treatment of HCV; ranolazine for the treatment of incomplete revascularization post-percutaneous coronary intervention and type II diabetes; and idelalisib for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, each currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, that could prevent completion of development of these product candidates. These risks include our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials, the need to modify or delay our clinical trials or to perform additional trials and the risk of failing to obtain FDA 40and other regulatory body approvals. As a result, our product candidates may never be successfully commercialized. Further, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of our product candidates if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If these programs and others in our pipeline cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. In addition, clinical trials involving our commercial products could raise new safety issues for our existing products, which could in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business. Due to our reliance on third-party contract research organizations to conduct our clinical trials, we are unable to directly control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. We rely on independent third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to perform most of our clinical studies, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, program management and bioanalytical analysis. Many important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are out of our direct control. If there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our CROs, our clinical trials may be delayed. Moreover, in our regulatory submissions, we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third-party CROs. If any of our CROs' processes, methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or inadequate, our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals could be adversely impacted. Expenses associated with clinical trials may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price. The clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our products, as well as clinical trials we are required to conduct after approval, are very expensive. It is difficult to accurately predict or control the amount or timing of these expenses from quarter to quarter, and the FDA and/or other regulatory agencies may require more clinical testing than we originally anticipated. Uneven and unexpected spending on these programs, including on the clinical trials that will be necessary to advance sofosbuvir, the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir and our other product candidates for the treatment of HCV and oncology, may cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and volatility in our stock price.We depend on relationships with other companies for sales and marketing performance, development and commercialization of product candidates and revenues. Failure to maintain these relationships, poor performance by these companies or disputes with these companies could negatively impact our business. We rely on a number of significant collaborative relationships with major pharmaceutical companies for our sales and marketing performance in certain territories. These include collaborations with BMS for Atripla in the United States, Europe and Canada; F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) for Tamiflu worldwide; and GSK for ambrisentan in territories outside of the United States. In some countries, we rely on international distributors for sales of Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva and AmBisome. Some of these relationships also involve the clinical development of these products by our partners. Reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including the risk that: •we are unable to control the resources our corporate partners devote to our programs or products; •disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of rights to technology developed with our corporate partners; •disagreements with our corporate partners could cause delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of product candidates or result in litigation or arbitration; •contracts with our corporate partners may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if one of these partners fails to perform; •our corporate partners have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional products and may pursue alternative technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors; •our corporate partners with marketing rights may choose to pursue competing technologies or to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our products than they do to products of their own development; and •our distributors and our corporate partners may be unable to pay us, particularly in light of current economic conditions. Given these risks, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed or revenues from products could decline. 41We also rely on collaborative relationships with major pharmaceutical companies for development and commercialization of certain product candidates. Gilead (as successor to Pharmasset) is a party to an October 29, 2004 collaboration agreement with Roche. The agreement granted Roche rights to develop PSI-6130, a cytidine analog, and its prodrugs, for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. The collaborative research efforts under the agreement ended on December 31, 2006. Roche later asked Pharmasset to consider whether Roche may have contributed to the inventorship of sofosbuvir and whether Pharmasset has complied with the confidentiality provisions of the collaboration agreement. Pharmasset advised us that it carefully considered the issues raised by Roche and that it believed any such issues are without merit. We have also considered these issues and reached the same conclusion. In March 2013, Roche initiated an arbitration against us and Pharmasset, predecessor to Gilead Pharmasset LLC, regarding the collaboration agreement. In the demand, Roche asserts that it has an exclusive license to sofosbuvir pursuant to the collaboration agreement because sofosbuvir, a prodrug of a uridine monophosphate analog, is allegedly a prodrug of PSI-6130. Roche further claims that, because it has exclusive rights to sofosbuvir, it also has an exclusive license to a patent covering sofosbuvir, and that we will infringe that patent by selling and offering for sale products containing sofosbuvir. Gilead and Gilead Pharmasset LLC filed their response to Roche's demand in April 2013. We believe Roche's claim is without merit. However, if Roche were to successfully establish exclusive rights to sofosbuvir, our expected revenues and earnings from the sale of sofosbuvir could be adversely affected.Under our April 2002 licensing agreement with GSK, we gave GSK the right to control clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of Hepsera in territories in Asia, Africa and Latin America. These include major markets for Hepsera, such as China, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. In November 2009, we entered into an agreement with GSK that provided GSK with exclusive commercialization rights and registration responsibilities for Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV in China. In October 2010, we granted similar rights to GSK in Japan and Saudi Arabia. The success of Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV in these territories depends almost entirely on the efforts of GSK. In this regard, GSK promotes Epivir-HBV/Zeffix, a product that competes with Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV. Consequently, GSK's marketing strategy for Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV may be influenced by its promotion of Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. We receive royalties from GSK equal to a percentage of GSK's net sales of Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV as well as net sales of GSK's Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. If GSK fails to devote sufficient resources to, or does not succeed in developing or commercializing Hepsera or Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV in its territories, our potential revenues in these territories may be substantially reduced.In addition, Cayston and Letairis are distributed through third-party specialty pharmacies, which are pharmacies specializing in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions that may require a high level of patient education and ongoing counseling. The use of specialty pharmacies requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing, medical affairs, regulatory affairs, legal and finance organizations and involves risks, including but not limited to risks that these specialty pharmacies will:•not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, patient data or safety complaints; •not effectively sell or support Cayston or Letairis; •not devote the resources necessary to sell Cayston or Letairis in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect; •not be able to satisfy their financial obligations to us or others; or •cease operations. We also rely on a third party to administer LEAP, the restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis. This third party provides information and education to prescribers and patients on the risks of Letairis, confirms insurance coverage and investigates alternative sources of reimbursement or assistance, ensures fulfillment of the risk management requirements mandated for Letairis by the FDA and coordinates and controls dispensing to patients through the third-party specialty pharmacies. Failure of this third party or the specialty pharmacies that distribute Letairis to perform as expected may result in regulatory action from the FDA or decreased Letairis sales, either of which would harm our business. Further, Cayston may only be taken by patients using a specific inhalation device that delivers the drug to the lungs of patients. Our ongoing distribution of Cayston is entirely reliant upon the manufacturer of that device. For example, the manufacturer could encounter other issues with regulatory agencies related to the device or be unable to supply sufficient quantities of this device. In addition, the manufacturer may not be able to provide adequate warranty support for the device after it has been distributed to patients. With respect to distribution of the drug and device to patients, we are reliant on the capabilities of specialty pharmacies. For example, the distribution channel for drug and device is complicated and requires coordination. The reimbursement approval processes associated with both drug and device are similarly complex. If the device manufacturer is unable to obtain reimbursement approval or receives approval at a lower-than-expected price, sales of Cayston may be adversely affected. Any of the previously described issues may limit the sales of Cayston, which would adversely affect our financial results.42Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to defend our patents and other intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally. We may not be able to obtain effective patents to protect our technologies from use by competitors and patents of other companies could require us to stop using or pay for the use of required technology. Patents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to: •obtain patents and licenses to patent rights;•preserve trade secrets;•defend against infringement and efforts to invalidate our patents; and•operate without infringing on the intellectual property of others.If we have a properly drafted and enforceable patent, it can be more difficult for our competitors to use our technology to create competitive products and more difficult for our competitors to obtain a patent that prevents us from using technology we create. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection both in the United States and internationally and file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements in our compounds, products and technology. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications and rights to patents related to our compounds, products and technology, but we cannot be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents. Patent applications are confidential for a period of time before a patent is issued. As a result, we may not know if our competitors filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent applications. Competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our products. In addition, if competitors file patent applications covering our technology, we may have to participate in interference/derivation proceedings or litigation to determine the right to a patent. Litigation and interference/derivation proceedings are unpredictable and expensive, such that, even if we are ultimately successful, our results of operations may be adversely affected by such events. From time to time, certain individuals or entities may challenge our patents. For example, in 2007, the Public Patent Foundation filed requests for re-examination with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) challenging four of our patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which is an active ingredient in Stribild, Complera/Eviplera, Atripla, Truvada and Viread. The PTO granted these requests, and in 2008, the PTO confirmed the patentability of all four patents. From time to time, we may become involved in disputes with inventors on our patents. For example, in March 2012, Jeremy Clark, a former employee of Pharmasset, which we acquired in January 2012, and inventor of U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572, filed a demand for arbitration in his lawsuit against Pharmasset and Dr. Raymond Schinazi. Mr. Clark initially filed the lawsuit against Pharmasset and Dr. Schinazi in February 2008 seeking to void the assignment provision in his employment agreement and assert ownership of U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572, which claims metabolites of sofosbuvir and RG7128. In December 2008, the court ordered a stay of the litigation pending the outcome of an arbitration proceeding required by Mr. Clark's employment agreement. Instead of proceeding with arbitration, Mr. Clark filed two additional lawsuits in September 2009 and June 2010, both of which were subsequently dismissed by the court. In September 2010, Mr. Clark filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the court's December 2008 order which was denied by the court. In December 2011, Mr. Clark filed a motion to appoint a special prosecutor. In February 2012, the court issued an order requiring Mr. Clark to enter arbitration or risk dismissal of his case. Mr. Clark filed a demand for arbitration in March 2012. The arbitration panel held a hearing in April 2013. In June 2013, the arbitration panel issued its decision in favor of Pharmasset (now Gilead) and Dr. Schinazi.AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) recently obtained United States Patent Nos. 8,466,159 and 8,492,386, which claim the use of a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir for the treatment of HCV. We own published and pending patent applications directed to the use of combinations for the treatment of HCV, and, specifically, to combinations of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir. Certain of those applications were filed before AbbVie's recently issued patents. For this reason and others, we believe AbbVie's patents are invalid. Accordingly, we do not expect AbbVie's patents to block or delay the commercialization of our combination products.Patents do not cover the ranolazine compound, the active ingredient of Ranexa. Instead, when it was discovered that only a sustained release formulation of ranolazine would achieve therapeutic plasma levels, patents were obtained on those formulations and the characteristic plasma levels they achieve. Patents do not cover the active ingredients in AmBisome. In addition, we do not have patent filings in China or certain other Asian countries covering all forms of adefovir dipivoxil, the active ingredient in Hepsera. Asia is a major market for therapies for HBV, the indication for which Hepsera has been developed. 43We may obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained for those products. Because patents have a limited life, which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of the patent may be limited. However, we may be able to apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates in some countries. Generic manufacturers have sought and may continue to seek FDA approval to market generic versions of our products through an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. See a description of our ANDA litigation in "Legal Proceedings" beginning on page 32 and risk factor entitled "Litigation with generic manufacturers has reduced and may continue to reduce our earnings. If we are unsuccessful in all or some of these lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and generic versions of our products could be launched prior to our patent expiry." beginning on page 46.Our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. If we infringe the valid patents of others, we may be prevented from commercializing products or may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties. We may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain these licenses or alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products. For example, we are aware of patents that may relate to our operation of LEAP, our restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis. We own patents that claim sofosbuvir as a chemical entity and its metabolites. However, the existence of issued patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have or obtain rights to patents which they may claim could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing the patented product candidates obtained from the Pharmasset acquisition. For example, we are aware of patents and patent applications owned by other parties that might be alleged to cover the use of sofosbuvir. If these other parties are successful in obtaining valid and enforceable patents, and establishing our infringement of those patents, we could be prevented from selling sofosbuvir unless we were able to obtain a license under such patents. If any license is needed it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In some instances, we may be required to defend our right to a patent on an invention through an Interference proceeding before the PTO. An Interference is an administrative proceeding before the PTO designed to determine who was the first to invent the subject matter being claimed by both parties. In February 2012, we received notice that the PTO had declared an Interference between our U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572 and Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s (Idenix) pending patent application no. 12/131868. An Interference is an administrative proceeding before the PTO designed to determine who was the first to invent the subject matter being claimed by both parties. Our patent covers metabolites of sofosbuvir and RG7128. Idenix is attempting to claim a class of compounds, including these metabolites, in its pending patent application. In the course of this proceeding, both parties will be called upon to submit evidence of the date they conceived of their respective inventions. The Interference will determine who was first to invent these compounds and therefore who is entitled to the patent claiming these compounds. In March 2013, the PTO Patent Trials and Appeal Board (the Board) determined that Idenix is not entitled to the benefit of any of its early application filing dates because none of those patent applications taught how to make the compounds in dispute. The Board also determined that we are entitled to the filing date of our earliest application. As a result, the Board determined that we were first to file the patent application on the compounds in dispute and we are therefore the “senior party” in the interference. In the second phase of the interference, the Board will determine who was first to invent the compounds. The party who is deemed first to invent will prevail in the Interference. Idenix bears the burden of establishing that despite its much later patent application filing date, they were nevertheless first to invent the compounds in dispute. In order to prove they were first to invent, Idenix must prove that it was first to conceive of a compound within the scope of those in dispute, namely that (1) the named inventors had identified the structure, a method of making and a use for a disputed compound and (2) that Idenix worked diligently from its earliest conception date until it made and tested the compound or filed its application in 2008. If the Board determines that Idenix was first to invent and is entitled to these patent claims and it is determined that we have infringed those claims, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Idenix to commercialize sofosbuvir and RG7128. Any determination by the Board can be appealed by either party to U.S. Federal Court. We believe the Idenix application involved in the Interference and similar U.S. and foreign patents claiming the same compounds and metabolites are invalid. As a result, we filed an Impeachment Action in Canadian Federal Court to invalidate the Idenix CA2490191 patent, which is the Canadian patent that corresponds to the Idenix U.S. Patent No. 7608600 and the Idenix patent application that is the subject of the Interference. Idenix has now asserted that our Canadian Patent No. 2527657, corresponding to the '572 patent in the Interference, is invalid. We filed a similar legal action in the Federal Court of Norway seeking to invalidate Idenix's corresponding Norwegian patent. We filed a similar legal action in the Federal Court of Australia seeking to invalidate the corresponding Australian patent. We may bring similar action in other countries in 2013. Idenix has not been awarded patents on these compounds in European countries, Japan or China. In the event such patents issue, we expect to challenge them in proceedings similar to those we invoked in Canada, Norway and Australia. 44Furthermore, we use significant proprietary technology and rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect certain aspects of our production and other technologies. Our trade secrets may become known or independently discovered by our competitors.Manufacturing problems, including at our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners, could cause inventory shortages and delay product shipments and regulatory approvals, which may adversely affect our results of operations. In order to generate revenue from our products, we must be able to produce sufficient quantities of our products to satisfy demand. Many of our products are the result of complex manufacturing processes. The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is also highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Our products are either manufactured at our own facilities or by third-party manufacturers or corporate partners. We depend on third parties to perform manufacturing activities effectively and on a timely basis for the majority of our solid dose products. In addition, Roche, either by itself or through third parties, is responsible for manufacturing Tamiflu. We, our third-party manufacturers and our corporate partners are subject to current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards as defined by the FDA and the EMA. Similar regulations are in effect in other countries. Our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners are independent entities who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks which are out of our control. If we or any of these third-party manufacturers or corporate partners fail to perform as required, this could impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis or receive royalties or cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. To the extent these risks materialize and affect their performance obligations to us, our financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, we, our third-party manufacturers and our corporate partners may only be able to produce some of our products at one or a limited number of facilities and, therefore, have limited manufacturing capacity for certain products. For example, in 2012, due to unexpected delays both in qualifying two new external sites and with expanding Cayston manufacturing in San Dimas, we were unable to supply enough Cayston to fulfill our projected demand. From February through September 2012, we suspended access for patients with new prescriptions for Cayston, subject to certain exceptions where specific medical need exists. As a result of our inability to manufacture sufficient Cayston to meet demand, the amount of revenues we received from the sale of Cayston was reduced.Our manufacturing operations are subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies. For example, in April 2013, the FDA conducted an inspection of our Foster City facility and issued 483 Inspectional Observations, which noted deficiencies in documentation and validation of certain quality testing procedures and methods. As a result of the observations, the FDA delivered Complete Response Letters notifying us that it was unable to approve our NDAs for elvitegravir and cobicistat as standalone agents. There is a risk that we may be unable to remedy the deficiencies cited by the FDA in the Complete Response Letters on a timely basis and that our inability to address those deficiencies could adversely impact currently marketed products and regulatory approval of products in development, which could adversely impact our anticipated revenues and stock price. Further, there is risk that regulatory agencies in other countries where marketing applications are pending will undertake similar additional reviews or apply a heightened standard of review, which could delay the approval of such products in those countries.Our ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize Cayston will depend upon our ability to manufacture in a multi-product facility. Aztreonam, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Cayston, is a mono-bactam Gram-negative antibiotic. We manufacture Cayston by ourselves in San Dimas, California, or through third parties, in multi-product manufacturing facilities. Historically, the FDA has permitted the manufacture of mono-bactams in multi-product manufacturing facilities; however, there can be no assurance that the FDA will continue to allow this practice. We do not currently have a single-product facility that can be dedicated to the manufacture of Cayston nor have we engaged a contract manufacturer with a single-product facility for Cayston. If the FDA prohibits the manufacture of mono-bactam antibiotics, like aztreonam, in multi-product manufacturing facilities in the future, we may not be able to procure a single-product manufacturing facility in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our commercial supplies of Cayston and our anticipated financial results attributable to such product. 45We may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, which would limit our ability to generate revenues. We need access to certain supplies and products to conduct our clinical trials and to manufacture our products. In light of the global economic downturn, we have had increased difficulty in purchasing certain of the raw materials used in our manufacturing process. If we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of these materials or find suitable alternate materials in a timely manner, our development efforts for our product candidates may be delayed or our ability to manufacture our products would be limited, which would limit our ability to generate revenues. Suppliers of key components and materials must be named in an NDA filed with the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authority for any product candidate for which we are seeking marketing approval, and significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required. Even after a manufacturer is qualified by the regulatory authority, the manufacturer must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with GMP. Manufacturers are subject to regular, periodic inspections by the regulatory authorities following initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, a regulatory authority determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, the regulatory authority may suspend the manufacturing operations. If the manufacturing operations of any of the single suppliers for our products are suspended, we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of product to meet market demand, which would in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business. In addition, if delivery of material from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason, we may be unable to ship certain of our products for commercial supply or to supply our products in development for clinical trials. In addition, some of our products and the materials that we utilize in our operations are made at only one facility. For example, we manufacture certain drug product intermediates utilized in AmBisome exclusively at our facilities in San Dimas, California. In the event of a disaster, including an earthquake, equipment failure or other difficulty, we may be unable to replace this manufacturing capacity in a timely manner and may be unable to manufacture AmBisome to meet market needs. Cayston is dependent on two different third-party single-source suppliers. First, aztreonam, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Cayston, is manufactured by a single supplier at a single site. Second, it is administered to the lungs of patients through a device that is made by a single supplier at a single site. Disruptions or delays with any of these single suppliers could adversely affect our ability to supply Cayston, and we cannot be sure that alternative suppliers can be identified in a timely manner, or at all. See the Risk Factor entitled “Our ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize Cayston will depend upon our ability to manufacture in a multi-product facility.” In addition, we depend on a single supplier for high-quality cholesterol, which is used in the manufacture of AmBisome. We also rely on a single source for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Hepsera, Letairis and Vistide and for the tableting of Letairis. Astellas US LLC, which markets Lexiscan in the United States, is responsible for the commercial manufacture and supply of product in the United States and is dependent on a single supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Lexiscan. Problems with any of the single suppliers we depend on may negatively impact our development and commercialization efforts. A significant portion of the raw materials and intermediates used to manufacture our HIV products (Stribild, Complera/Eviplera, Atripla, Truvada, Viread and Emtriva) are supplied by Chinese-based companies. As a result, an international trade dispute between China and the United States or any other actions by the Chinese government that would limit or prevent Chinese companies from supplying these materials would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our HIV products to meet market needs and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results. Litigation with generic manufacturers has reduced and may continue to reduce our earnings. If we are unsuccessful in all or some of these lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and generic versions of our products could be launched prior to our patent expiry.As part of the approval process of some of our products, the FDA granted a New Chemical Entity exclusivity period during which other manufacturers' applications for approval of generic versions of our product will not be granted. Generic manufacturers may challenge the patents protecting products that have been granted exclusivity one year prior to the end of the exclusivity period. Generic manufacturers have sought and may continue to seek FDA approval for a similar or identical drug through an ANDA, the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. We received notices that generic manufacturers have submitted ANDAs to manufacture a generic version of Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva, Ranexa and Tamiflu in the United States and Atripla, Truvada and Viread in Canada. We expect to begin trial with some of the generic manufacturers in 2013. In April 2013, we and Teva Pharmaceuticals (Teva) reached an agreement to settle the ongoing patent litigation concerning the four patents that protect tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in our Atripla, Truvada and Viread products. Under the agreement, Teva will be allowed to launch a generic version of Viread on December 15, 2017. The settlement agreement was filed and is under review with the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice. As a result of the recent invalidation of the patents protecting entecavir and due to declining sales of 46Hepsera in the United States, in March 2013, we granted Sigmapharm Labs (Sigmapharm) a Covenant Not to Sue and filed a motion to dismiss all claims in the lawsuit in March 2013. Once Sigmapharm obtains FDA approval of its product it may elect to launch its generic product. The trial related to the U.S. patents associated with Ranexa took place in April and May 2013. The court has not yet issued a decision in that case. The trial related to two Canadian patents associated with Atripla, Truvada and Viread is currently scheduled for September 2013. The trial related to the U.S. patents protecting emtricitabine is scheduled to begin in October 2013.We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, and we may spend significant resources enforcing and defending these patents. If we are unsuccessful in these lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva, Ranexa and Tamiflu in the United States and Atripla, Truvada and Viread in Canada could be substantially shortened. Further, if all of the patents covering one or more products are invalidated, the FDA or Canadian Ministry of Health could approve the requests to manufacture a generic version of such products in the United States or Canada, respectively, prior to the expiration date of those patents. The sale of generic versions of these products earlier than their patent expiration would have a significant negative effect on our revenues and results of operations.We face credit risks from our Southern European customers that may adversely affect our results of operations. Our European product sales to government-owned or supported customers in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have historically been and continue to be subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. This has resulted and may continue to result in days sales outstanding being significantly higher in these countries due to the average length of time that accounts receivable remain outstanding. As of June 30, 2013, our accounts receivable in these countries totaled approximately $891.2 million of which, $383.8 million were past due greater than 120 days and $135.4 million were past due greater than 365 days as follows (in thousands):   June 30, 2013  Greater than120 days past due Greater than365 days past dueItaly $82,610 $36,739Spain 187,903 29,671Portugal 90,326 65,683Greece 22,949 3,261Total $383,788 $135,354Historically, receivable balances with certain publicly-owned hospitals accumulate over a period of time and are then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments. This pattern is also experienced by other pharmaceutical companies that sell directly to hospitals. If significant changes were to occur in the reimbursement practices of these European governments or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from these customers and our results of operations would be adversely affected.In 2012, we collected $533.4 million in past due accounts receivable from customers based in Spain and Portugal. This included $349.7 million in proceeds from a one-time factoring arrangement where we sold receivables in Spain.In 2011, the Greek government settled substantially all of its outstanding receivables subject to the bond settlement with zero-coupon bonds that trade at a discount to face value. In March 2012, the Greek government restructured its sovereign debt which impacted all holders of Greek bonds. As a result, we recorded a $40.1 million loss. Our revenues and gross margin could be reduced by imports from countries where our products are available at lower prices. Prices for our products are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country. Our sales in countries with relatively higher prices may be reduced if products can be imported into those or other countries from lower price markets. There have been cases in which other pharmaceutical products were sold at steeply discounted prices in the developing world and then re-exported to European countries where they could be re-sold at much higher prices. If this happens with our products, particularly Truvada and Viread, which we have agreed to make available at substantially reduced prices to 134 countries participating in our Gilead Access Program, or Atripla, which Merck distributes at substantially reduced prices to HIV infected patients in developing countries under our 2006 agreement, our revenues would be adversely affected. In addition, we have established partnerships with thirteen Indian generic manufacturers to distribute high-quality, low-cost generic versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to 112 developing world countries, including India. If generic versions of our medications under these licenses are then re-exported to the United States, Europe or other markets outside of these 112 countries, our revenues would be adversely affected. 47In addition, purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively high may adversely impact our revenues and gross margin and may cause our sales to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For example, in the European Union, we are required to permit products purchased in one country to be sold in another country. Purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively high affect the inventory level held by our wholesalers and can cause the relative sales levels in the various countries to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and not reflect the actual consumer demand in any given quarter. These quarterly fluctuations may impact our earnings, which could adversely affect our stock price and harm our business. Expensive litigation and government investigations have reduced and may continue to reduce our earnings. We are involved in a number of litigation, investigation and other dispute-related matters that require us to expend substantial internal and financial resources. We expect these matters will continue to require a high level of internal and financial resources for the foreseeable future. These matters have reduced and will continue to reduce our earnings. Please see a description of our Department of Justice investigation; Interference and litigation proceedings with Idenix; and arbitration with Roche beginning on page 34. The outcome of the lawsuits above, or any other lawsuits that may be brought against us, the investigation or any other investigations that may be initiated, are inherently uncertain, and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant expenses, monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us that could significantly reduce our earnings and cash flows and harm our business.In some countries, we may be required to grant compulsory licenses for our products or face generic competition for our products. In a number of developing countries, government officials and other interested groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs for HIV infection available at low cost. Alternatively, governments in those developing countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products, thereby reducing our product sales. For example, in the past, certain offices of the government of Brazil have expressed concern over the affordability of our HIV products and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory licenses to permit the manufacture of otherwise patented products for HIV infection, including Viread. In July 2009, the Brazilian patent authority rejected our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viread. This was the highest level of appeal available to us within the Brazilian patent authority. Because we do not currently have a patent in Brazil, the Brazilian government now purchases its supply of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate from generic manufacturers. In addition, concerns over the cost and availability of Tamiflu related to a potential avian flu pandemic and H1N1 influenza generated international discussions over compulsory licensing of our Tamiflu patents. For example, the Canadian government considered allowing Canadian manufacturers to manufacture and export the active ingredient in Tamiflu to eligible developing and least developed countries under Canada's Access to Medicines Regime. Furthermore, Roche issued voluntary licenses to permit third-party manufacturing of Tamiflu. For example, Roche granted a sublicense to Shanghai Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. for China and a sublicense to India's Hetero Drugs Limited for India and certain developing countries. Should one or more compulsory licenses be issued permitting generic manufacturing to override our Tamiflu patents, or should Roche issue additional voluntary licenses to permit third-party manufacturing of Tamiflu, those developments could reduce royalties we receive from Roche's sales of Tamiflu. Certain countries do not permit enforcement of our patents, and third-party manufacturers are able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries. Compulsory licenses or sales of generic versions of our products could significantly reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if generic versions of our products are imported into territories where we have existing commercial sales.Changes in royalty revenue disproportionately affect our pre-tax income, earnings per share and gross margins. A portion of our revenues is derived from royalty revenues recognized from collaboration agreements with third parties. Royalty revenues impact our pre-tax income, earnings per share and gross margins disproportionately more than their contributions to our revenues. Any increase or decrease to our royalty revenue could be material and could significantly impact our operating results. For example, Roche's Tamiflu sales have unpredictable variability due to their strong relationship with seasonal influenza and global pandemic planning efforts. Tamiflu royalties increased sharply in 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 primarily as a result of pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Tamiflu royalties since the second quarter of 2010 have decreased due to declining pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. During periods when our royalty revenue from Tamiflu increase, we will see a disproportionate increase in our pre-tax income, earnings per share and gross margins. Similarly, during periods when our royalty from Tamiflu decrease, we will see a disproportionate decrease in our pre-tax income, earnings per share and gross margins.48We may face significant liability resulting from our products that may not be covered by insurance and successful claims could materially reduce our earnings. The testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our commercial products, as well as product candidates in development, involve substantial risk of product liability claims. These claims may be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others. In recent years, coverage and availability of cost-effective product liability insurance has decreased, so we may be unable to maintain sufficient coverage for product liabilities that may arise. In addition, the cost to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims may exceed our coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate coverage or if claims exceed our coverage, our financial condition and our ability to clinically test our product candidates and market our products will be adversely impacted. In addition, negative publicity associated with any claims, regardless of their merit, may decrease the future demand for our products and impair our financial condition. Business disruptions from natural or man-made disasters may harm our future revenues. Our worldwide operations could be subject to business interruptions stemming from natural or man-made disasters for which we may be self-insured. Our corporate headquarters and Fremont locations, which together house a majority of our R&D activities, and our San Dimas and Oceanside manufacturing facilities are located in California, a seismically active region. As we do not carry earthquake insurance and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake. Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, our portion of the non-deductible pharmaceutical excise tax, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, mergers and acquisitions, the amortization of certain acquisition related intangibles for which we receive no tax benefit, future levels of R&D spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings and resolution of federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2008 and 2009 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.If we fail to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop new product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates. Our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, governmental regulation and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense, and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms. If we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts, our business may be harmed. 49ITEM 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
