Item 1A. Risk Factors”) included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are presented in U.S. dollars.Management OverviewGilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we or us) is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and experimental drug candidate, we seek to improve the care of patients suffering from life-threatening diseases around the world. Our primary areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS, liver diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), serious cardiovascular/metabolic and respiratory conditions and various oncologic disease areas. We continue to seek to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through a product acquisition and in-licensing strategy. Our product portfolio is comprised of Atripla®, Truvada®, Viread®, Emtriva®, Complera®/Eviplera®, Hepsera®, AmBisome®, Letairis®, Ranexa®, Cayston® and Vistide®. In addition, we also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements. For example, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu®; GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK) markets Hepsera and Viread in certain territories outside of the United States; GSK also markets Volibris® outside of the United States; Astellas Pharma US, Inc. markets AmBisome in the United States and Canada; Astellas US LLC markets Lexiscan® injection in the United States; Rapidscan Pharma Solutions, Inc. markets Rapiscan in certain territories outside of the United States; Menarini International Operations Luxembourg SA markets Ranexa in certain territories outside of the United States; and Japan Tobacco Inc. (Japan Tobacco) markets Truvada, Viread and Emtriva in Japan.Business HighlightsDuring the second quarter of 2012, our product sales increased 14% over the same quarter in 2011 and we continued to advance our product pipeline across all therapeutic areas. We believe the combination of our existing internal research programs and our recent partnerships and acquisitions will drive research and development efforts and accelerate our product pipeline so that we can continue to bring innovative therapies to individuals who are living with unmet medical needs. 25HIV In May 2012, we announced that the Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted to support approval of Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection among uninfected adults. In July 2012, the FDA approved Truvada for PrEP.Additionally in May 2012, we announced that the Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted 13 to one in support of approval of Quad, a complete single tablet regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-naïve adults. We submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) in October 2011 and the FDA has set a target review date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of August 27, 2012. The recommendations of the Advisory Committee are not binding, but will be considered in the FDA's review of the Quad NDA.In May 2012, we also announced that our Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for cobicistat was validated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Cobicistat is our pharmacoenhancing or "boosting" agent that increases blood levels of certain commercially available protease inhibitors, including atazanavir and darunavir, in order to enable once-daily dosing. Review of the MAA will be conducted under the centralized licensing procedure, which, when finalized, provides one marketing authorization in all 27 member states of the European Union (EU). In June 2012, we announced our NDA submission to the FDA for marketing approval of cobicistat. The NDA is supported by 48-week data from a pivotal Phase 3 study (Study 114) and pharmacokinetic data demonstrating that cobicistat boosts blood levels of atazanavir and darunavir similar to ritonavir.In June 2012, we announced that our MAA for elvitegravir, an integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced patients, was validated by the EMA. Review of the MAA will be conducted under the centralized licensing procedure, which, when finalized, provides one marketing authorization in all 27 member states of the EU. We also announced our NDA submission to the FDA for marketing approval of elvitegravir. The NDA is supported by 96-week data from a pivotal Phase 3 study (Study 145).HCVIn April 2012, we announced data from our ELECTRON and QUANTUM studies. These studies found that 88% and 53% of genotype 1 patients and treatment-naïve patients, respectively, taking a 12-week all-oral regimen of GS-7977 and ribavirin achieved a sustained viral response four weeks after the completion of a 12-week course of therapy. We also announced data from our ATOMIC study, which found that 90% of genotype 1 HCV patients achieved a sustained viral response 12 weeks after a 12-week course of therapy with GS-7977 plus ribavirin and interferon.In July 2012, we announced data from two Phase 2 studies evaluating a 24-week course of therapy with GS-7977 and ribavirin in treatment-naïve genotype 1 patients. In the QUANTUM study, 53 percent of the patients achieved SVR-4 after the completion of a 24-week course of therapy. The second study was conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in a cohort of predominantly African American patients, a population which has historically been more difficult to treat for HCV. One hundred percent of the patients in this cohort who completed a 24-week course of therapy achieved SVR-4 after completion of therapy. These data indicate that the treatment of genotype 1 patients with GS-7977 plus ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks is sufficient to cure the majority, but not all genotype 1 patients, of their disease.In April 2012, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) announced data from its Phase 2 study evaluating GS-7977 in combination with daclatasvir with and without ribavirin in genotype 1 and genotype 2 and 3 treatment-naïve infected patients. The data showed that 100% of genotype 1 and 91% of genotype 2 and 3 patients achieved a sustained viral response four weeks after the completion of a 24-week course of treatment.OncologyIn May 2012, we announced the initiation of our first Phase 3 study in oncology evaluating the efficacy and safety of GS-1101 (Study 116). GS-1101 is an investigational, first-in-class specific inhibitor of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) delta isoform and is being evaluated in combination with rituximab in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. A second Phase 3 study (Study 115) in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients began screening patients in July and is evaluating GS-1101 in combination with bendamustine and rituximab. GS-1101 is also in Phase 2 evaluation as a potential treatment for indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.26Financial HighlightsDuring the second quarter of 2012, total product sales were $2.32 billion, an increase of 14% over the same period in 2011. The growth in product sales was driven primarily by growth in our antiviral franchise, where sales increased 14% to $2.01 billion when compared to the same period last year. Total revenues in the second quarter of 2012 grew 13% to $2.41 billion compared to $2.14 billion in the second quarter of 2011. Product gross margin remained consistent at 74% for the second quarters of 2012 and 2011. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $396.2 million for the second quarter of 2012 and $282.4 million for the same period in 2011, an increase of $113.8 million, or 40%. The increase was due primarily to the continued advancement of our product pipeline, particularly in the liver disease and oncology franchises. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $332.5 million for the second quarter of 2012 and $304.3 million for the same period in 2011, an increase of $28.2 million, or 9%. The increase was due primarily to increased expenses to support the ongoing growth of our business. Net income for the second quarter of 2012 was $711.6 million, a 5% decrease from $746.2 million for the same period in 2011 due primarily to the investments we made in our existing clinical programs and increased interest expense related to the additional debt we issued in connection with the Pharmasset acquisition. Our diluted earnings per share decreased by 2% to $0.91 in the second quarter of 2012 from $0.93 in the same period in 2011. Liquidity and Financing Activity Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $2.27 billion at June 30, 2012, a decrease of $7.69 billion from December 31, 2011. The primary uses of cash during the first six months of 2012 were $11.1 billion for the acquisition of Pharmasset and $700.0 million for the repayment of bank debt. The primary sources of cash during the first six months of 2012 were $1.74 billion of operating cash flows and $2.14 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of bank debt in conjunction with our acquisition of Pharmasset.In the second quarter of 2012, we repurchased a total of $240.9 million or 4.8 million shares of common stock under our January 2011, three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program. As of June 30, 2012, we had repurchased $664.8 million of our common stock under this program.AcquisitionOn January 17, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Pharmasset, a publicly-held clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and commercializing novel drugs to treat viral infections. Pharmasset's primary focus was the development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of HCV infection. Pharmasset's lead compound, now known as GS-7977, is a nucleotide analog being evaluated in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HCV-infection across genotypes. We believe the acquisition of Pharmasset provides us with an opportunity to complement our existing HCV portfolio and helps advance our effort to develop all-oral regimens for the treatment of HCV. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset for $137 per share in cash through a tender offer and subsequent merger under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger entered into in November 2011. The aggregate cash payment to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock was $11.1 billion. We financed the transaction with approximately $5.2 billion in cash on hand, $3.7 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.2 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012. The Pharmasset acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The results of operations of Pharmasset have been included in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income since January 13, 2012, the date on which we acquired approximately 88% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset, cash consideration was transferred, and as a result, we obtained effective control of Pharmasset. The acquisition was completed on January 17, 2012, at which time Pharmasset became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead and was integrated into our operations. As we do not track earnings results by product candidate or therapeutic area, we do not maintain separate earnings results for the acquired Pharmasset business. The following table summarizes the components of the cash paid to acquire Pharmasset (in thousands):Total consideration transferred$10,858,372Stock-based compensation expense193,937Total cash paid$11,052,30927The $11.1 billion cash payment consisted of a $10.38 billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders as well as a $668.3 million cash payment to option holders under the Pharmasset stock option plans. The $10.38 billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders and $474.3 million of the cash payment to the option holders under the Pharmasset stock option plans were accounted for as consideration transferred. The remaining $193.9 million of cash payment was accounted for as stock-based compensation expense resulting from the accelerated vesting of Pharmasset employee options immediately prior to the acquisition.The following table summarizes the allocation of the consideration transferred to the acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands):Intangible assets - in-process research and development$10,720,000Cash and cash equivalents106,737Other assets acquired (liabilities assumed), net(43,182)Total identifiable net assets10,783,555Goodwill74,817Total consideration transferred$10,858,372In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D) The estimated fair value of the acquired IPR&D related to GS-7977 was $10.72 billion, which was determined using a probability-weighted income approach, that discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The estimated net cash flows were discounted using a discount rate of 12%, which is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to that of Pharmasset. This rate is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for the acquisition and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible asset. The projected cash flows from GS-7977 were based on key assumptions such as: the time and resources needed to complete its development considering its stage of development on the acquisition date, the probability of obtaining approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory agencies, estimates of revenues and operating profits, the life of the potential commercialized product and other associated risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in future target markets. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived assets until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. Goodwill The $74.8 million of goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is attributable to the synergies expected from combining our R&D operations with Pharmasset's. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.Stock-Based Compensation ExpenseThe stock-based compensation expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of employee options immediately prior to the acquisition was reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income as follows (in thousands):Research and development expense$100,149Selling, general and administrative expense93,788Total stock-based compensation expense$193,937Other CostsOther costs incurred in connection with the acquisition include (in thousands):  Six Months Ended Three Months Ended  June 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Transaction costs (e.g. investment advisory, legal and accounting fees) $10,166 $28,461Bridge financing costs 7,333 23,817Restructuring costs 11,512 —Total other costs $29,011 $52,27828The following table summarizes these costs by the line item in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income in which these costs were recognized (in thousands):  Six Months Ended Three Months Ended  June 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Research and development expense $7,478 $—Selling, general and administrative expense 14,200 28,461Interest expense 7,333 23,817Total other costs $29,011 $52,278Pro Forma Information The following unaudited pro forma information presents the combined results of operations of Gilead and Pharmasset as if the acquisition of Pharmasset had been completed on January 1, 2011, with adjustments to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma results do not reflect any operating efficiencies or potential cost savings which may result from the consolidation of the operations of Gilead and Pharmasset. Accordingly, these unaudited pro forma results are presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations of the combined company would have been if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the period presented, nor are they indicative of future results of operations (in thousands):   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended  June 30, June 30,  2012 2011 2012 2011Total revenues $2,405,186 $2,137,253 $4,687,635 $4,063,347Net income attributable to Gilead $716,432 $685,262 $1,300,983 $1,079,362The unaudited pro forma consolidated results include non-recurring pro forma adjustments that assume the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2011. Stock-based compensation expenses of $193.9 million incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2012 were included in the net income attributable to Gilead for the six months ended June 30, 2011. Other costs of $17.5 million incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2012 were included in the net income attributable to Gilead for the six months ended June 30, 2011. Of the $17.5 million, $1.1 million was incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2012. Other costs of $52.3 million incurred during the three months ended December 31, 2011 were included in net income attributable to Gilead for the six months ended June 30, 2011.Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and JudgmentsThere have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments during the six months ended June 30, 2012 compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.Results of OperationsTotal Revenues Total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2012 were $2.41 billion, up 13% compared to $2.14 billion for the same period in 2011. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, total revenues were $4.69 billion, up 15% compared to $4.06 billion for the same period in 2011. Total revenues included product sales, royalty revenues and contract and other revenues. Increases in total revenues were driven by growth in product sales. A significant percentage of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies and we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $31.7 million on our second quarter 2012 product sales and an unfavorable impact of $48.3 million on our product sales for the six months ended June 30, 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011. 29Product SalesTotal product sales were $2.32 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2012, an increase of 14% over total product sales of $2.04 billion for the same period in 2011. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, total product sales were $4.53 billion, an increase of 16% over total product sales of $3.90 billion for the same period in 2011. The increases for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 were driven primarily by our antiviral franchise, resulting from increased sales of Atripla, Truvada and Complera/Eviplera, which was launched in the second half of 2011. Product sales in the United States increased by 21% and 23% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily driven by the continued sales growth in our antiviral franchise and the launch of Complera. Antiviral product sales results for the second quarter of 2012 reflect the benefit of robust purchases due to the early communication of Ryan White Federal Funds and the desire by states to reduce patient wait lists. As a result, purchasing patterns in future quarters may be impacted. The increase in U.S. product sales also reflected sales growth in our other franchises. Letairis sales contributed $101.6 million and $188.9 million to our three and six months ended June 30, 2012 product sales, respectively, an increase of 38% and 39% compared to the same periods in 2011. Ranexa sales contributed $95.6 million and $178.8 million to our three and six months ended June 30, 2012 product sales, respectively, an increase of 11% and 16% compared to the same periods in 2011.Product sales in Europe increased by 3% and 5% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily driven by sales growth in our antiviral franchise and the launch of Eviplera. Antiviral product sales in Europe for the second quarter of 2012 reflect the benefit of purchasing in advance of the European holidays, consistent with what we have observed in past years. As a result, purchasing patterns in future quarters may be impacted. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $32.9 million and $54.5 million on our European product sales in the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, compared to the same periods last year.

We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business.31R&D expenses summarized above consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. R&D expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2012 increased by $113.8 million, or 40%, compared to the same period in 2011, due primarily to a $77.7 million increase in clinical studies and outside services mainly related to study progression in the liver disease and oncology therapeutic areas and a $24.3 million increase in personnel expenses due to higher headcount and expenses to support the growth of our business.R&D expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2012 increased by $317.6 million, or 59%, compared to the same period in 2011, due primarily to a $133.0 million increase in clinical studies and outside services mainly related to study progression in the liver disease and oncology therapeutic areas; stock-based compensation expense of $100.1 million resulting from the Pharmasset acquisition in the first quarter of 2012; and a $58.9 million increase in personnel expenses due to higher headcount and expenses to support the growth of our business.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Three Months Ended   Six Months Ended    June 30,   June 30,  (In thousands, except percentages) 2012 2011 Change 2012 2011 ChangeSelling, general and administrative $332,505 $304,269 9% $775,626 $599,837 29%SG&A expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; and other general and administrative costs. SG&A expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2012 increased by $28.2 million or 9%, compared to the same period in 2011, due primarily to $20.9 million in increased headcount related and other expenses to support the growth of our business; an $8.9 million increase in the pharmaceutical excise tax; and $7.6 million in acquisition-related restructuring costs. These increases were partially offset by a net reduction in bad debt expense of $15.2 million, which included a gain of $29.9 million related to a one-time sale of our accounts receivable balances in Spain. Within Greece, Italy and Portugal the number of days our receivables are outstanding has continued to increase. SG&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2012 increased by $175.8 million or 29%, compared to the same period in 2011, due primarily to stock-based compensation expense of $93.8 million resulting from the Pharmasset acquisition; a $24.2 million increase in the pharmaceutical excise tax; a $21.0 million increase in headcount related expenses to support the ongoing growth of our business; and a $18.9 million increase in acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs. These increases were partially offset by a net reduction in bad debt expense of $12.3 million, which included a gain of $29.9 million related to a one-time sale of our accounts receivable balances in Spain in the second quarter of 2012.Interest ExpenseInterest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 was $88.4 million and $185.7 million, respectively, and increased by $42.3 million and $98.4 million compared to the same periods in 2011, respectively. The increase for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 was due primarily to the additional debt we issued in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, which included $3.70 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $3.2 million and $12.8 million in interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, related to the maturity of our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 (May 2011 Notes).Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 was a net expense of $1.1 million and $35.2 million, compared to net income of $12.0 million and $25.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011. The change for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 was due primarily to a decrease in interest income of $15.2 million and $27.4 million, respectively, resulting from a lower cash balance after we funded the Pharmasset acquisition and a lower average yield during the period. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, the change in other income (expense), net, also included a $40.1 million loss on Greek bonds related to Greece's restructuring of its sovereign debt in the first quarter of 2012. 32Provision for Income TaxesOur provision for income taxes was $263.5 million and $494.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, compared to $240.1 million and $467.4 million for the same periods in 2011, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 27.2% and 30.2% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, compared to our effective tax rate of 24.4% and 25.2% for the same periods in 2011, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 were higher than the effective tax rates for the same periods in 2011 as a result of the expiration of the federal research tax credit as of December 31, 2011, lower earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States as a percentage of total earnings and the stock-based compensation expense related to the Pharmasset acquisition for which we receive no tax benefit. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes and the stock-based compensation expense related to the Pharmasset acquisition for which we receive no tax benefit. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be permanently reinvested.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased significantly in the first quarter of 2012 as we completed our acquisition of Pharmasset in January 2012. Below is additional information describing our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, working capital and primary sources and uses of cash.The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the periods presented (in thousands): June 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$2,271,674 $9,963,972Working capital$857,428 $11,403,995  Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 2011Cash provided by (used in):   Operating activities$1,743,620 $1,763,797Investing activities$(11,378,080) $(770,171)Financing activities$1,380,711 $(886,852)Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.27 billion at June 30, 2012, a decrease of $7.69 billion or 77% from $9.96 billion as of December 31, 2011 due primarily to our acquisition of Pharmasset for $11.1 billion in January 2012. Also in January 2012, we raised an additional $2.15 billion from the issuance of bank debt, of which, we repaid $700.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2012. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was partially offset by $1.74 billion in cash flows from operations during the six months ended June 30, 2012. Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at June 30, 2012, approximately $1.43 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. We do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity in the United States to fund our domestic operational and strategic needs. 33Working CapitalWorking capital was $857.4 million at June 30, 2012. The decrease of $10.55 billion from December 31, 2011 was primarily attributable to: •a decrease of $11.1 billion in cash used in the Pharmasset acquisition; •an increase of $1.35 billion related to the current portion of the bank debt issued to finance the Pharmasset acquisition; and•an increase of $622.8 million in the current portion of our convertible senior notes due in May 2013.Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities of $1.74 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2012 primarily related to net income of $1.14 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $133.6 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $97.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and $350.9 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operations included the impact of the $193.9 million stock-based compensation expense related to Pharmasset and $349.7 million of proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable balances in Spain.Cash provided by operating activities of $1.76 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2011 primarily related to net income of $1.39 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $155.8 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $99.6 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, $40.0 million of deferred income taxes and $75.0 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2012 was $11.38 billion, consisting primarily of $10.75 billion used in our acquisition of Pharmasset, net of the stock-based compensation expense and cash acquired. Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was $770.2 million, consisting of a net use of $140.1 million in purchases of marketable securities, $588.6 million used in our acquisitions of Arresto Biosciences, Inc. and Calistoga Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and $41.5 million of capital expenditures.Subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2012, we signed a purchase and sale agreement to acquire an office building for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $180.0 million.Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing ActivitiesCash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2012 was $1.38 billion, driven primarily by net proceeds of $2.14 billion from the issuance of bank debt in conjunction with the Pharmasset acquisition and proceeds of $201.8 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. The cash proceeds were partially offset by the $700.0 million used to repay bank debt during the period and $261.8 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program, including commissions. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was $886.9 million, driven primarily by the $1.27 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program, including commissions, and $650.0 million used to repay our May 2011 Notes, partially offset by the $987.4 million of net proceeds from the issuance of our senior unsecured notes due in April 2021. As of June 30, 2012, the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under our January 2011, three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program was $4.34 billion. 34Long-Term Debt The following table summarizes the carrying amount of our borrowings under various financing arrangements (in thousands):     Carrying Value as ofType of BorrowingDescriptionIssue DateDue DateInterest RateJune 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Convertible SeniorMay 2013 NotesApril 2006May 20130.625%$622,763 $607,036Convertible SeniorMay 2014 NotesJuly 2010May 20141.00%1,195,745 1,181,525Convertible SeniorMay 2016 NotesJuly 2010May 20161.625%1,144,866 1,132,293Senior UnsecuredApril 2021 NotesMarch 2011April 20214.50%992,495 992,066Senior UnsecuredDecember 2014 NotesDecember 2011December 20142.40%749,236 749,078Senior UnsecuredDecember 2016 NotesDecember 2011December 20163.05%698,979 698,864Senior UnsecuredDecember 2021 NotesDecember 2011December 20214.40%1,247,284 1,247,138Senior UnsecuredDecember 2041 NotesDecember 2011December 20415.65%997,772 997,734Term Loan FacilityTerm LoanJanuary 2012January 2015Variable300,000 —Credit FacilityShort-Term RevolverJanuary 2012January 2013Variable400,000 —Credit FacilityFive-Year RevolverJanuary 2012January 2017Variable750,000 —Total debt, net    $9,099,140 $7,605,734Less current portion    1,972,763 —Total long-term debt, net    $7,126,377 $7,605,734We were eligible to borrow up to an aggregate of $1.25 billion in revolving credit loans under an amended and restated credit agreement that we entered into in 2007. The credit agreement also included a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2011, we had $4.0 million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement. In January 2012, we fully repaid the outstanding obligations under this credit agreement and terminated the credit agreement. In January 2012, in conjunction with our acquisition of Pharmasset, we entered into a five-year $1.25 billion revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement), a $750.0 million short-term revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement) and a $1.00 billion term loan facility (the Term Loan Credit Agreement). We borrowed $750.0 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, $400.0 million under the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and $1.00 billion under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, upon the close of the acquisition. In March 2012, we repaid $350.0 million of the outstanding debt under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. In June 2012, we repaid an additional $350.0 million of the outstanding debt under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. All three credit agreements contain customary representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and events of default. The loans bear interest at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the applicable credit agreement. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay loans under any of these agreements in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit agreements and notes indentures as of June 30, 2012, we were in compliance with all such covenants.The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement was inclusive of a $30.0 million swing line loan sub-facility and a $25.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. As of June 30, 2012, we had $4.0 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate and all unpaid borrowings thereunder shall be due and payable in January 2017. The Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate and all unpaid borrowings thereunder shall be due and payable in January 2013; however, at our request, the maturity date may be extended until January 2014. All principal repayment installments under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will be due and payable as specified in the Term Loan Credit Agreement, with the final principal installment payment due and payable in January 2015. Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.Recent Accounting PronouncementsDuring the three months ended June 30, 2012, there were no new accounting pronouncements issued that are expected to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements or results of operations. 35ITEM 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThere have been no material changes in our market risk during the six months ended June 30, 2012 compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. In January 2012, we entered into credit agreements in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, that are subject to variable interest rates that create an exposure to interest rate risk similar to that disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.In March 2012, the Greek government restructured its sovereign debt which impacted all holders of Greek bonds. As a result, we recorded a $40.1 million loss related to the debt restructuring as part of other income (expense), net on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and exchanged the Greek government-issued bonds for new securities, which we liquidated during the first quarter of 2012.As of June 30, 2012, our accounts receivable in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $791.8 million, of which $291.4 million were greater than 120 days past due and $114.6 million were greater than 365 days past due. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate at June 30, 2012. In June 2012, we received payment on $460.6 million in past due accounts receivable from customers based in Spain. Included in this amount were proceeds from a one-time factoring arrangement, where we sold Spanish receivables with a carrying value of $319.8 million, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We received proceeds of $349.7 million and recorded a gain of $29.9 million, resulting primarily from the reversal of the related allowance for doubtful accounts. This gain was recorded as an offset to selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. As of June 30, 2012, we had no continuing involvement with the transferred receivables, which were derecognized at the time of the sale.Within Greece, Italy, and Portugal the number of days our receivables are outstanding has continued to increase. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable. However, we will continue to monitor the European economic environment for any collectability issues related to our outstanding receivables. ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation as of June 30, 2012 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at June 30, 2012.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2012, and has concluded that there was no change during such quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Limitations on the Effectiveness of ControlsA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met and, as set forth above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system were met.36PART II.OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Litigation with Generic ManufacturersIn November 2008, we received notice that Teva Pharmaceuticals (Teva) submitted an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Truvada. In the notice, Teva alleges that two of the patents associated with emtricitabine, owned by Emory University and licensed exclusively to us, are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva's manufacture, use or sale of a generic fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In December 2008, we filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents. In March 2009, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and efavirenz . In the notice, Teva challenged the same two emtricitabine patents. In May 2009, we filed another lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents, and this lawsuit was consolidated with the lawsuit filed in December 2008. In January 2010, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Viread. In the notice, Teva challenged four of the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate patents protecting Viread. In January 2010, we also received notices from Teva amending its ANDAs related to generic versions of our Atripla and Truvada products. In the notice related to Teva's ANDA for a generic version of Atripla, Teva challenged four patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, two additional patents related to emtricitabine and two patents related to efavirenz. In the notice related to Teva's ANDA for a generic version of Truvada, Teva challenged four patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and two additional patents related to emtricitabine. In March 2010, we filed lawsuits against Teva for infringement of the four Viread patents and two additional emtricitabine patents. In March 2010, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Merck & Co., Inc. filed a lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the patents related to efavirenz. Because we filed our lawsuits within the requisite 45 day period provided in the Hatch Waxman Act, there are stays preventing FDA approval of Teva's ANDAs for 30 months or until a district court decision adverse to the patents. The 30-month stay for all three Teva ANDAs expired in July 2012. However, as a result of the court's scheduling orders, Teva is prohibited from launching at risk upon expiration of that 30-month stay.In June 2010, we received notice that Lupin Limited (Lupin) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of sustained release ranolazine. In the notice, Lupin alleges that ten of the patents associated with Ranexa are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Lupin's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Ranexa. In July 2010, we filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New Jersey against Lupin for infringement of our patents for Ranexa. In August 2010, we received notice that Sigmapharm Labs (Sigmapharm) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic adefovir dipivoxil. In the notice, Sigmapharm alleges that both of the patents associated with Hepsera are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Sigmapharm's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Hepsera. In September 2010, we filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New Jersey against Sigmapharm for infringement of our patents. One of the patents challenged by Sigmapharm has also been challenged by Ranbaxy, Inc. (Ranbaxy) pursuant to a notice received in October 2010. The patent challenged by Ranbaxy expires in July 2018. We have the option of filing a lawsuit at any time if we believe that Ranbaxy is infringing our patent. In February 2011, we received notice that Natco Pharma Ltd. (Natco) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic oseltamivir phosphate. In the notice, Natco alleges that one of the patents associated with Tamiflu is invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Natco's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Tamiflu. In March 2011, we and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New Jersey against Natco for infringement of one of the patents associated with Tamiflu. In November 2011, we received notice that Teva submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS) to the Canadian Ministry of Health requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In the notice, Teva alleges that three of the patents associated with Truvada are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In January 2012, we filed a lawsuit in Canadian Federal Court against Teva seeking an order of prohibition against approval of this ANDS. 37In December 2011, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDS to the Canadian Ministry of Health requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and efavirenz. In the notice, Teva alleges that three of our patents associated with the efavirenz component of Atripla and two of Merck's patents associated with Atripla are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva's manufacture, use or sale of a generic fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and efavirenz.In February 2012, we filed a lawsuit in Canadian Federal Court against Teva seeking an order of prohibition against approval of this ANDS. In July 2012, we received notice that Lupin submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Truvada. In the notice, Lupin alleges that four patents associated with emtricitabine and four patents associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Lupin's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of a fixed dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. We are currently reviewing the notice letter. In July 2012, we received notice that Cipla Ltd. submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Emtriva. In the notice, Cipla alleges that two patents associated with emtricitabine are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Cipla's manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of emtricitabine. We are currently reviewing the notice letter. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, and we may spend significant resources enforcing and defending these patents. If we are unsuccessful in these lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Ranexa and Tamiflu in the United States and Atripla and Truvada in Canada could be substantially shortened. Further, if all of the patents covering those products are invalidated, the FDA or Canadian Ministry of Health could approve the requests to manufacture a generic version of such products in the US or Canada, respectively, prior to the expiration date of those patents. Department of Justice InvestigationIn June 2011, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California requesting documents related to the manufacture, and related quality and distribution practices, of Atripla, Emtriva, Hepsera, Letairis, Truvada, Viread and Complera. We have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with this governmental inquiry. Interference Proceedings and Litigation with Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.In February 2012, we received notice that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) had declared an Interference between our U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572 and Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s (Idenix) pending patent application no. 12/131868. An Interference is an administrative proceeding before the PTO designed to determine who was the first to invent the subject matter being claimed by both parties. Our patent covers metabolites of GS-7977 and RG7128. Idenix is attempting to claim a class of compounds, including these metabolites, in their pending patent application. In the course of this proceeding, both parties will be called upon to submit evidence of the date they conceived of their respective inventions. The Interference will determine who was first to invent these compounds and therefore who is entitled to the patent claiming these compounds. If the administrative law judge determines Idenix is entitled to these patent claims and it is determined that we have infringed those claims, we may be required to obtain a license from, and pay royalties to, Idenix to commercialize GS-7977 and RG7128. Any determination by the PTO can be challenged by either party in U.S. Federal Court. In June 2012, we met with Idenix in mandatory settlement discussions. The parties were unable to settle the Interference due to our widely divergent views on the strength of our respective positions, on whether we need a license to Idenix's patents and on whether Idenix needs a license to Gilead patents to develop and manufacture its pipeline products. We believe the Idenix patent involved in the Interference and similar U.S. and foreign patents claiming the same compounds and metabolites are invalid. As a result, we filed an Impeachment Action in Canadian Federal Court to invalidate the Idenix CA2490191 patent, which is the Canadian patent that corresponds to the Idenix U.S. Patent No. 7608600 and the Idenix patent application that is the subject of the Interference. Idenix has not been awarded patents on these compounds and metabolites in many territories, including Europe, Japan, and China. In the event such patents issue, we expect to challenge them in proceedings similar to the one we invoked in Canada.38Contract ArbitrationIn March 2012, Jeremy Clark, a former employee of Pharmasset, Inc. (Pharmasset), which we acquired in January 2012, and inventor of U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572, filed a demand for arbitration in his lawsuit against Pharmasset and Dr. Raymond Schinazi. Mr. Clark initially filed the lawsuit against Pharmasset and Dr. Schinazi in Alabama District Court in February 2008 seeking to void the assignment provision in his employment agreement and assert ownership of U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572, which claims metabolites of GS-7977 and RG7128. In December 2008, the court ordered a stay of the litigation pending the outcome of an arbitration proceeding required by Mr. Clark's employment agreement. Instead of proceeding with arbitration, Mr. Clark filed two additional lawsuits in September 2009 and June 2010, both of which were subsequently dismissed by the court. In September 2010, Mr. Clark filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the court's December 2008 order which was denied by the court. In December 2011, Mr. Clark filed a motion to appoint a special prosecutor. In February 2012, the Alabama Court issued an order requiring Mr. Clark to enter arbitration or risk dismissal of his case. Mr. Clark filed a demand for arbitration in March 2012. We cannot predict the outcome of the arbitration. If Mr. Clark's prior assignment of this patent to Pharmasset is voided by the arbitration panel, and he is ultimately found to be the owner of the 7,429,572 patent and it is determined that we have infringed the patent, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Mr. Clark to commercialize GS-7977 and RG7128. Other MattersWe are a party to various legal actions that arose in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that any of such legal actions will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated business, financial position or results of operations. ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSIn evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. A manifestation of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and, therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.The public announcement of data from clinical studies evaluating GS-7977 in HCV-infected patients is likely to cause significant volatility in our stock price. If the development of GS-7977 alone or in combination with GS-5885 is delayed or discontinued, our stock price could decline significantly.During 2012, we expect to receive a significant amount of data from clinical trials evaluating GS-7977, an investigational nucleotide analog we acquired through our purchase of Pharmasset Inc. (Pharmasset), alone or in combination with other direct acting antivirals in HCV-infected individuals across genotypes. In February 2012, we announced that the majority of HCV genotype 1 patients with a prior “null” response to an interferon-containing regimen enrolled in an arm of our ongoing ELECTRON study experienced viral relapse within four weeks of completing 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 plus ribavirin. In April 2012, we announced data from our ELECTRON and QUANTUM studies. These studies found that 88 and 53 percent of genotype 1 patients and treatment-naïve patients, respectively, taking a 12-week all-oral regimen of GS-7977 and ribavirin achieved a sustained viral response four weeks (SVR-4) after the completion of a 12-week course of therapy. In July 2012, we announced data from two Phase 2 studies evaluating a 24-week course of therapy with GS-7977 and ribavirin in treatment-naïve genotype 1 patients. In the QUANTUM study, 53 percent of the patients achieved SVR-4 after the completion of a 24-week course of therapy. The second study was conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in a cohort of predominantly African American patients, a population which has historically been more difficult to treat for HCV. One hundred percent of the patients in this cohort who completed a 24-week course of therapy achieved SVR-4 after completion of therapy. These data indicate that the treatment of genotype 1 patients with GS-7977 plus ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks is sufficient to cure the majority, but not all genotype 1 patients, of their disease.In April 2012, we also announced data from our ATOMIC study, which found that 90 percent of genotype 1 HCV patients achieved a sustained viral response 12 weeks after a 12-week course of therapy with GS-7977 plus ribavirin and interferon. Also in April 2012, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) announced data from its Phase 2 study evaluating GS-7977 in combination with daclatasvir, an investigational NS5A inhibitor, with and without ribavirin in genotype 1 and genotype 2 and 3 treatment-naïve HCV infected patients. The data showed that 100% of genotype 1 and 91% of genotype 2 and 3 patients achieved SVR-4 after the completion of a 24-week course of this treatment regimen. Based on the data described above, we have worked with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European regulators to agree upon a Phase 3 program for GS-7977 and our investigational NS5A inhibitor, GS-5885. Our new drug application (NDA) for GS-7977 will be supported by four Phase 3 studies named Fission, Positron, Fusion and Neutrino. Fission is the first study in 500 genotype 2 and 3 naïve patients comparing 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 and ribavirin to the current standard of care of 24 weeks of treatment with interferon and ribavirin. The second study, Positron, is also comparing 12 weeks of treatment 39with GS-7977 and ribavirin in 240 genotype 2 and 3 interferon intolerant/ineligible patients to placebo. The Fusion study will include 200 genotype 2 and 3 treatment experienced patients exploring 12 or 16 weeks duration of treatment with GS-7977 and ribavirin. All three studies (Fission, Positron and Fusion) are fully enrolled, and all patients have started therapy. Neutrino, the fourth Phase 3 study, is a single arm study evaluating a 12 week course of GS-7977, interferon and ribavirin in 300 genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6 infected-patients. Screening in the Neutrino study is complete and the last patient should receive the drug treatment by mid-August 2012. With these four Phase 3 studies under way, assuming data from the studies are positive, we anticipate being able to file for regulatory approvals for GS-7977 by mid-2013. If successful, we expect the initial indication to be for 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 and ribavirin in genotype 2 and 3 patients and for 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977, interferon and ribavirin in genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6 patients.In parallel, we are also advancing GS-7977 in combination with GS-5885 for the treatment of genotype 1 patients. We have developed two formulations of GS-7977 and GS-5885 co-formulated into a single fixed-dose combination tablet. The investigational new drug application on the first fixed-dose combination was filed in June 2012, and a Phase 1 study evaluating the bioavailability of the active drugs was initiated in mid-July 2012. If the Phase 1 data are positive, we expect to initiate a Phase 3 study with this fixed dose combination in the fourth quarter of 2012. This Phase 3 study is planned as a four arm randomized study in 800 patients evaluating the fixed-dose combination with and without ribavirin for either 12 or 24 weeks in treatment- naïve genotype-1 infected patients. These data will allow us to decide on the design of the second confirmatory study supporting the NDA of the GS-7977 and GS-5885 fixed-dose combination. If treatment of genotype 1-infected patients with the GS-7977 and GS-5885 fixed-dose combination for 12 weeks results in acceptably high SVR4 rates, then the second confirmatory study could be initiated in the first half of 2013. If the data from the second study is also positive, we anticipate being able to file for regulatory approval of the fixed-dose combination by mid-2014.Development programs, including the development programs described above, are subject to numerous risks that could result in developmental and regulatory delays or in a decision to discontinue further development of GS-7977 and/or GS-5885. As a result, we may not complete our clinical studies of GS-7977 and GS-5885 or any regulatory filings in the currently anticipated timelines or at all. For example, we may obtain negative Phase 1 data which may delay the development of GS-7977 in combination with GS-5885. In addition, regulatory authorities require that patients have a sustained viral response for 12 weeks after the cessation of therapy to be considered “cured” of HCV. If data from any of the clinical studies indicate that a smaller than anticipated number of patients achieved a sustained viral response at 4, 12 or 24 weeks post-treatment, our development programs for the treatment of HCV may be delayed or discontinued and our stock price may decline significantly. Further, developing drugs for the treatment of HCV is an extremely competitive field and a significant number of drugs are under development. Depending on the length of any delay we may experience in our development of GS-7977 and GS-5885, other companies who are developing competitive compounds in HCV may be able to progress their development timelines and potentially bring compounds to market before GS-7977 and/or GS-5885or shortly thereafter.A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales of our HIV products, particularly Atripla and Truvada. If we are unable to maintain or continue increasing sales of these products, our results of operations may be adversely affected. We are currently dependent on sales of our products for the treatment of HIV infection, particularly Atripla and Truvada, to support our existing operations. Our HIV products contain tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and/or emtricitabine, which belong to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. Were the treatment paradigm for HIV to change, causing nucleoside-based therapeutics to fall out of favor, or if we were unable to maintain or continue increasing our HIV product sales, our results of operations would likely suffer and we would likely need to scale back our operations, including our spending on research and development (R&D) efforts. For the quarter ended June 30, 2012, Atripla and Truvada product sales together were $1.69 billion, or 70% of our total revenues. We may not be able to sustain or increase the growth rate of sales of our HIV products, especially Atripla and Truvada, for any number of reasons including, but not limited to, the following: •As our HIV products are used over a longer period of time in many patients and in combination with other products, and additional studies are conducted, new issues with respect to safety, resistance and interactions with other drugs may arise, which could cause us to provide additional warnings or contraindications on our labels, narrow our approved indications or halt sales of a product, each of which could reduce our revenues. •As our HIV products mature, private insurers and government payers often reduce the amount they will reimburse patients for these products, which increases pressure on us to reduce prices. •A large part of the market for our HIV products consists of patients who are already taking other HIV drugs. If we are not successful in encouraging physicians to change patients' regimens to include our HIV products, the sales of our HIV products will be limited. •As generic HIV products are introduced into major markets, our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected. 40If we fail to commercialize new products or expand the indications for existing products, our prospects for future revenues may be adversely affected. If we do not introduce new products to market or increase sales of our existing products, we will not be able to increase or maintain our total revenues and continue to expand our R&D efforts. Drug development is inherently risky and many product candidates fail during the drug development process. For example, in January 2011, we announced our decision to terminate our Phase 3 clinical trial of ambrisentan in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In April 2011, we announced our decision to terminate our Phase 3 clinical trial of aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients with Burkholderia spp. In addition, our marketing applications for our single tablet “Quad” regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine, for the treatment of HIV in treatment-naïve patients; elvitegravir for the treatment of HIV in treatment-experienced patients; and cobicistat, a pharmacoenhancing or “boosting” agent, may not be approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Further, even if marketing approval is granted for any of these products, there may be significant limitations on their use. Further, we may be unable to file our marketing applications for new products, including GS-7977 and GS-5885 in the currently anticipated timelines and marketing approval for the products may not be granted. Our results of operations will be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reforms. Legislative and regulatory changes to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In March 2010, healthcare reform legislation was adopted in the United States. As a result, we are required to further rebate or discount products reimbursed or paid for by various public payers, including Medicaid and other entities eligible to purchase discounted products through the 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Service Act, such as AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs). The discounts, rebates and fees in the legislation that impacted us include: •our minimum base rebate amount owed to Medicaid on products reimbursed by Medicaid has been increased by 8%, and the discounts or rebates we owe to ADAPs and other Public Health Service entities which reimburse or purchase our products have also been increased by 8%; •we are required to extend rebates to patients receiving our products through Medicaid managed care organizations; •we are required to provide a 50% discount on products sold to patients while they are in the Medicare Part D “donut hole;” and •we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of a new industry fee (also known as the pharmaceutical excise tax) of $2.5 billion for 2011, calculated based on select government sales during the 2009 calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales. The amount of the industry fee imposed on the pharmaceutical industry as a whole will increase to $2.8 billion in 2012, with additional increases over the next several years to a peak of $4.1 billion per year in 2018, and then decrease to $2.8 billion in 2019 and thereafter. As the amount of the industry fee increases, our product sales increase and drug patents expire on major drugs, such as Lipitor, we expect our portion of the excise tax to increase as well. We estimate the pharmaceutical excise tax to be $80-$100 million in 2012, compared to $50 million in 2011. The excise tax is not tax deductible. Further, even though not addressed in the healthcare reform legislation, discussions continue at the federal level on legislation that would either allow or require the federal government to directly negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers or set minimum requirements for Medicare Part D pricing. In addition, state Medicaid programs could request additional supplemental rebates on our products as a result of the increase in the federal base Medicaid rebate. Private insurers could also use the enactment of these increased rebates to exert pricing pressure on our products, and to the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow Medicaid coverage and payment developments, the adverse effects may be magnified by private insurers adopting lower payment schedules. Our existing products are subject to reimbursement from government agencies and other third parties. Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressures may reduce profitability. Successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of governmental and third-party payer reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement. In the United States, the European Union and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. 41A significant portion of our sales of the majority of our products are subject to significant discounts from list price and rebate obligations. In the United States, state ADAPs, which purchase a significant portion of our HIV products, rely on federal, supplemental federal and state funding to help fund purchases of our products. Given the current economic downturn, we have experienced a shift in our payer mix as patients previously covered by private insurance move to public reimbursement programs that require rebates or discounts from us or as patients previously covered by one public reimbursement program move to another public reimbursement program that requires greater rebates or discounts from us. As a result of this shift, revenue growth may be lower than prescription growth. If federal and state funds are not available in amounts sufficient to support the number of patients that rely on ADAPs, sales of our HIV products could be negatively impacted which would reduce our revenues. For example, during the first quarter of 2011, the state budget crisis in Florida led to a temporary movement of patients who were previously covered by Florida's ADAP into industry-supported patient assistance programs. Due to the insufficiency of federal and state funds and as many states have reduced eligibility criteria, we have also seen and may continue to see an increase in the number of patients on state ADAP wait lists. Until these patients are enrolled in ADAP, they generally receive product from industry-supported patient assistance programs or are unable to access treatment. The increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our product sales and profitability. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. In Europe, the success of our commercialized products, and any other product candidates we may develop, will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because in many European countries patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In addition, negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization by 12 months or more. Reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. In many international markets, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals, including through the implementation of reference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes and profit control, and they expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as volumes increase. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on our products, and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. For example, in June 2010, Spain imposed an incremental discount on all branded drugs and in August 2010, Germany increased the rebate on prescription pharmaceuticals. As generic drugs come to market, we may face price decreases for our products in some countries in the European Union. Approximately 41% of our product sales occur outside the United States, and currency fluctuations and hedging expenses may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price. Because a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative value of such sales increases. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. We use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. We cannot predict future fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate of the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly against certain currencies and our hedging program does not sufficiently offset the effects of such appreciation, our results of operations will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline. Additionally, the expenses that we recognize in relation to our hedging activities can also cause our earnings to fluctuate. The level of hedging expenses that we recognize in a particular period is impacted by the changes in interest rate spreads between the foreign currencies that we hedge and the U.S. dollar. 42Our inability to accurately estimate demand for our products, as well as sales fluctuations as a result of inventory levels held by wholesalers, pharmacies and non-retail customers make it difficult for us to accurately forecast sales and may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our financial results and our stock price. In the quarter ended June 30, 2012, approximately 79% of our product sales in the United States were to three wholesalers, Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corp. and AmerisourceBergen Corp. The U.S. wholesalers with whom we have entered into inventory management agreements make estimates to determine end user demand and may not be completely effective in matching their inventory levels to actual end user demand. As a result, changes in inventory levels held by those wholesalers can cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to these wholesalers do not match end user demand. In addition, inventory is held at retail pharmacies and other non-wholesale locations with whom we have no inventory management agreements and no control over buying patterns. Adverse changes in economic conditions or other factors may cause retail pharmacies to reduce their inventories of our products, which would reduce their orders from wholesalers and, consequently, the wholesalers' orders from us, even if end user demand has not changed. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2010, our wholesalers increased their inventory levels for our antiviral products. In the first quarter of 2011, our wholesalers drew down on their inventory such that inventory levels for our antiviral products moved to the lower end of the contractual boundaries set by our inventory management agreements. As inventory in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter, we may continue to see fluctuations in our earnings and a mismatch between prescription demand for our products and our revenues. In addition, the non-retail sector in the United States, which includes government institutions, including state ADAPs, correctional facilities and large health maintenance organizations, tends to be even less consistent in terms of buying patterns and often causes quarter over quarter fluctuations that do not necessarily mirror patient demand. Federal and state budget pressures, as well as the annual grant cycles for federal and state ADAP funds, may cause ADAP purchasing patterns to not reflect patient demand. For example, in the first and second quarters of 2012, we observed large non-retail purchases by a number of state ADAPs which exceeded patient demand. We believe such purchases were driven by the grant cycle for federal ADAP funds, the early communication of Ryan White Federal Funds and the desire by state ADAPs to reduce patient wait lists, and therefore purchasing patterns may be impacted in future quarters. As a result, we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the purchasing patterns of our non-retail customers which may result in fluctuations in our product sales, revenues and earnings in the future. In light of the global economic downturn and budget crises faced by many European countries, we have observed variations in purchasing patterns induced by cost containment measures in Europe. We believe these measures have caused some purchasers to reduce inventory of our products in the distribution channels, and in some cases, even at the patient level, which has decreased our revenues and caused fluctuations in our product sales and earnings. We may continue to see this trend in the future. We face significant competition. We face significant competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, most of whom have substantially greater resources than we do. In addition, our competitors have more products and have operated in the fields in which we compete for longer than we have. Our HIV products compete primarily with products from the joint venture established by GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK) and Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) which markets fixed-dose combination products that compete with Atripla, Truvada and Complera/Eviplera. For example, lamivudine, marketed by this joint venture, is competitive with emtricitabine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Emtriva and a component of Atripla, Truvada and Complera/Eviplera. We also face competition from generic HIV products. In May 2010, the compound patent covering Epivir (lamivudine) itself expired in the United States, and generic lamivudine is now available in the United States, Spain and Portugal, and received pricing approval in Italy. We expect that generic versions of lamivudine will be launched in other countries within the European Union. In May 2011, a generic version of Combivir (lamivudine and zidovudine) was approved and was recently launched in the United States. In addition, in late 2011, generic tenofovir also became available in Turkey, which resulted in an increase in the rebate for Viread in Turkey. For Viread and Hepsera for treatment of chronic hepatitis B, we compete primarily with products produced by GSK, BMS and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Novartis) in the United States, the European Union and China. For AmBisome, we compete primarily with products produced by Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) and Pfizer. In addition, we are aware of at least three lipid formulations that claim similarity to AmBisome becoming available outside of the United States, including the possible entry of such formulations in Greece and Taiwan. These formulations may reduce market demand for AmBisome. Furthermore, the manufacture of lipid formulations of amphotericin B is very complex and if any of these formulations are found to be unsafe, sales of AmBisome may be negatively impacted by association. Letairis competes directly with a product produced by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. and indirectly with pulmonary arterial hypertension products 43from United Therapeutics Corporation and Pfizer. Ranexa competes predominantly with generic compounds from three distinct classes of drugs, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates for the treatment of chronic angina in the United States. Cayston competes with a product marketed by Novartis. Tamiflu competes with products sold by GSK and generic competitors. In addition, a number of companies are pursuing the development of technologies which are competitive with our existing products or research programs. These competing companies include specialized pharmaceutical firms and large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently or together with other pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs. If significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates, our future sales may be reduced, which would adversely affect our results of operations. The data supporting the marketing approvals for our products and forming the basis for the safety warnings in our product labels were obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration and, in some cases, from post-approval use. As our products are used over longer periods of time by many patients with underlying health problems, taking numerous other medicines, we expect to continue to find new issues such as safety, resistance or drug interaction issues, which may require us to provide additional warnings or contraindications on our labels or narrow our approved indications, each of which could reduce the market acceptance of these products. Our product Letairis, which was approved by the FDA in June 2007, is a member of a class of compounds called endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) which pose specific risks, including serious risks of birth defects. Because of these risks, Letairis is available only through the Letairis Education and Access Program (LEAP), a restricted distribution program intended to help physicians and patients learn about the risks associated with the product and assure appropriate use of the product. As the product is used by additional patients, we may discover new risks associated with Letairis which may result in changes to the distribution program and additional restrictions on the use of Letairis which may decrease demand for the product.  Regulatory authorities have been moving towards more active and transparent phamacovigilance and are making greater amounts of stand-alone safety information directly available to the public through websites and other means, e.g. periodic safety update report summaries, risk management plan summaries and various adverse event data. Safety information, without the appropriate context and expertise, may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action which may potentially cause our product sales or stock price to decline. Further, if serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues arise with our marketed products, sales of these products could be limited or halted by us or by regulatory authorities and our results of operations would be adversely affected. Our operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products. The products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We are continuing clinical trials for Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Complera/Eviplera, Emtriva, AmBisome, Letairis, Ranexa and Cayston for currently approved and additional uses. We anticipate that we will file for marketing approval in additional countries and for additional indications and products over the next several years. These products may fail to receive such marketing approvals on a timely basis, or at all. Further, our marketed products and how we manufacture and sell these products are subject to extensive regulation and review. Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing or promotional activities may result in restrictions on our products, including withdrawal of the products from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those related to promotion and manufacturing, we could be subject to penalties including fines, suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products and criminal prosecution.   For example, under FDA rules, we are often required to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk and implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for our products, which could include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to healthcare providers or other elements as the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the drug, which could include imposing certain restrictions on the distribution or use of a product. Failure to comply with these or other requirements, if imposed on a sponsor by the FDA, could result in significant civil monetary penalties and our operating results may be adversely affected. 44The results and anticipated timelines of our clinical trials are uncertain and may not support continued development of a product pipeline, which would adversely affect our prospects for future revenue growth. We are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of products that we develop for each intended use through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials. The results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. Even successfully completed large-scale clinical trials may not result in marketable products. If any of our product candidates fails to achieve its primary endpoint in clinical trials, if safety issues arise or if the results from our clinical trials are otherwise inadequate to support regulatory approval of our product candidates, commercialization of that product candidate could be delayed or halted. For example, in January 2011, we announced our decision to terminate our Phase 3 clinical trial of ambrisentan in patients with IPF and, in April 2011, we announced our decision to terminate our Phase 3 clinical trial of aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of CF in patients with Burkholderia spp. In addition, we may also face challenges in clinical trial protocol design. If the clinical trials for any of the product candidates in our pipeline are delayed or terminated, our prospects for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted. For example, we face numerous risks and uncertainties with our product candidates, including GS-7977 and GS-5885 for the treatment of hepatitis C; aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of bronchiectasis; ranolazine for the treatment of incomplete revascularization post-percutaneous coronary intervention and type II diabetes; and GS-1101 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, each currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, that could prevent completion of development of these product candidates. These risks include our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials, the need to modify or delay our clinical trials or to perform additional trials and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. As a result, our product candidates may never be successfully commercialized. Further, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of our product candidates if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If these programs and others in our pipeline cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. In addition, clinical trials involving our commercial products could raise new safety issues for our existing products, which could in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business. Due to our reliance on third-party contract research organizations to conduct our clinical trials, we are unable to directly control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. We rely on independent third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to perform most of our clinical studies, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, program management and bioanalytical analysis. Many important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are out of our direct control. If there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our CROs, our clinical trials may be delayed. Moreover, in our regulatory submissions, we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third-party CROs. If any of our CROs' processes, methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or inadequate, our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals could be adversely impacted.  Expenses associated with clinical trials may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price. The clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our products, as well as clinical trials we are required to conduct after approval, are very expensive. It is difficult to accurately predict or control the amount or timing of these expenses from quarter to quarter, and the FDA and/or other regulatory agencies may require more clinical testing than we originally anticipated. Uneven and unexpected spending on these programs, including on the clinical trials that will be necessary to advance GS-7977, GS-5885 and our other product candidates for the treatment of HCV, may cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and our stock price may decline. We depend on relationships with other companies for sales and marketing performance, development and commercialization of product candidates and revenues. Failure to maintain these relationships, poor performance by these companies or disputes with these companies could negatively impact our business. We rely on a number of significant collaborative relationships with major pharmaceutical companies for our sales and marketing performance in certain territories. These include collaborations with BMS for Atripla in the United States, Europe and Canada; F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) for Tamiflu worldwide; and GSK for ambrisentan in territories outside of the United States. In some countries, we rely on international distributors for sales of Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva and AmBisome. Some of these relationships also involve the clinical development of these products by our partners. Reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including the risk that: •we are unable to control the resources our corporate partners devote to our programs or products; •disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of rights to technology developed with our corporate partners; 45•disagreements with our corporate partners could cause delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of product candidates or result in litigation or arbitration; •contracts with our corporate partners may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if one of these partners fails to perform; •our corporate partners have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional products and may pursue alternative technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors; •our corporate partners with marketing rights may choose to pursue competing technologies or to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our products than they do to products of their own development; and •our distributors and our corporate partners may be unable to pay us, particularly in light of current economic conditions. Given these risks, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed or revenues from products could decline. We also rely on collaborative relationships with major pharmaceutical companies for development and commercialization of certain product candidates. Gilead (as successor to Pharmasset) is a party to a collaboration agreement with Roche to develop PSI-6130 and its prodrugs for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. The collaborative research efforts under this agreement ended on December 31, 2006. Roche later asked Pharmasset to consider whether Roche may have contributed to the inventorship of GS-7977 and whether Pharmasset has complied with the confidentiality provisions of the collaboration agreement. Pharmasset advised us that it carefully considered the issues raised by Roche and that it believed any such issues are without merit. We have also considered these issues and reached the same conclusion. However, if Roche were to successfully assert that it contributed to the inventorship of GS-7977 and either independently develop GS-7977 or file an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to market GS-7977, Roche could at some point in the future market that product and begin competing against us prior to the expiration of our patents for GS-7977. Such marketing activity by Roche could materially reduce the revenues we expect to receive from the sale of GS-7977, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Under our April 2002 licensing agreement with GSK, we gave GSK the right to control clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of Hepsera in territories in Asia, Africa and Latin America. These include major markets for Hepsera, such as China, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. In November 2009, we entered into an agreement with GSK that provided GSK with exclusive commercialization rights and registration responsibilities for Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in China. In October 2010, we granted similar rights to GSK in Japan and Saudi Arabia. The success of Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in these territories depends almost entirely on the efforts of GSK. In this regard, GSK promotes Epivir-HBV/Zeffix, a product that competes with Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Consequently, GSK's marketing strategy for Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B may be influenced by its promotion of Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. We receive royalties from GSK equal to a percentage of GSK's net sales of Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B as well as net sales of GSK's Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. If GSK fails to devote sufficient resources to, or does not succeed in developing or commercializing Hepsera or Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in its territories, our potential revenues in these territories may be substantially reduced. In addition, Cayston and Letairis are distributed through third-party specialty pharmacies, which are pharmacies specializing in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions that may require a high level of patient education and ongoing counseling. The use of specialty pharmacies requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing, medical affairs, regulatory affairs, legal and finance organizations and involves risks, including but not limited to risks that these specialty pharmacies will: •not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, patient data or safety complaints; •not effectively sell or support Cayston or Letairis; •not devote the resources necessary to sell Cayston or Letairis in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect; •not be able to satisfy their financial obligations to us or others; or •cease operations. We also rely on a third party to administer LEAP, the restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis. This third party provides information and education to prescribers and patients on the risks of Letairis, confirms insurance coverage and investigates alternative sources of reimbursement or assistance, ensures fulfillment of the risk management requirements mandated for Letairis by the FDA and coordinates and controls dispensing to patients through the 46third-party specialty pharmacies. Failure of this third party or the specialty pharmacies that distribute Letairis to perform as expected may result in regulatory action from the FDA or decreased Letairis sales, either of which would harm our business. Further, Cayston may only be taken by patients using a specific inhalation device that delivers the drug to the lungs of patients. Our ongoing distribution of Cayston is entirely reliant upon the manufacturer of that device. For example, the manufacturer could encounter other issues with regulatory agencies related to the device or be unable to supply sufficient quantities of this device. In addition, the manufacturer may not be able to provide adequate warranty support for the device after it has been distributed to patients. With respect to distribution of the drug and device to patients, we are reliant on the capabilities of specialty pharmacies. For example, the distribution channel for drug and device is complicated and requires coordination. The reimbursement approval processes associated with both drug and device are similarly complex. If the device manufacturer is unable to obtain reimbursement approval or receives approval at a lower-than-expected price, sales of Cayston may be adversely affected. Any of the previously described issues may limit the sales of Cayston, which would adversely affect our financial results. Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to protect our patents and other intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally. We may not be able to obtain effective patents to protect our technologies from use by competitors and patents of other companies could require us to stop using or pay for the use of required technology. Patents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to: •obtain patents and licenses to patent rights; •preserve trade secrets; •defend against infringement and efforts to invalidate our patents; and •operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. If we have a properly drafted and enforceable patent, it can be more difficult for our competitors to use our technology to create competitive products and more difficult for our competitors to obtain a patent that prevents us from using technology we create. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection both in the United States and internationally and file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements in our compounds, products and technology. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications and rights to patents related to our compounds, products and technology, but we cannot be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents. Patent applications are confidential for a period of time before a patent is issued. As a result, we may not know if our competitors filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent the technology that is the subject of our patent applications. Competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our products. In addition, if competitors file patent applications covering our technology, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or litigation to determine the right to a patent. Litigation and interference proceedings are unpredictable and expensive, such that, even if we are ultimately successful, our results of operations may be adversely affected by such events. From time to time, certain individuals or entities may challenge our patents. For example, in 2007, the Public Patent Foundation filed requests for re-examination with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) challenging four of our patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which is an active ingredient in Atripla, Truvada and Viread. The PTO granted these requests and issued non-final rejections for the four patents, which is a step common in a proceeding to initiate the re-examination process. In 2008, the PTO confirmed the patentability of all four patents. From time to time, we may become involved in disputes with inventors on our patents. For example, in March 2012, Jeremy Clark, a former employee of Pharmasset, which we acquired in January 2012, and inventor of U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572, filed a demand for arbitration in his lawsuit against Pharmasset and Dr. Raymond Schinazi. Mr. Clark initially filed the lawsuit against Pharmasset and Dr. Schinazi in February 2008 seeking to void the assignment provision in his employment agreement and assert ownership of U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572, which claims metabolites of GS-7977 and RG7128. In December 2008, the court ordered a stay of the litigation pending the outcome of an arbitration proceeding required by Mr. Clark's employment agreement. Instead of proceeding with arbitration, Mr. Clark filed two additional lawsuits in September 2009 and June 2010, both of which were subsequently dismissed by the court. In September 2010, Mr. Clark filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the court's December 2008 order which was denied by the court. In December 2011, Mr. Clark filed a motion to appoint a special prosecutor. In February 2012, the court issued an order requiring Mr. Clark to enter arbitration or risk dismissal of his case. Mr. Clark filed a demand for arbitration in March 2012. We cannot predict the outcome of the 47arbitration. If Mr. Clark's prior assignment of this patent to Pharmasset is voided by the arbitration panel, and he is ultimately found to be the owner of the 7,429,572 patent and it is determined that we have infringed the patent, we may be required to obtain a license from and pay royalties to Mr. Clark to commercialize GS-7977 and RG7128.Patents do not cover the ranolazine compound, the active ingredient of Ranexa. Instead, when it was discovered that only a sustained release formulation of ranolazine would achieve therapeutic plasma levels, patents were obtained on those formulations and the characteristic plasma levels they achieve. Patents do not cover the active ingredients in AmBisome. In addition, we do not have patent filings in China or certain other Asian countries covering all forms of adefovir dipivoxil, the active ingredient in Hepsera. Asia is a major market for therapies for hepatitis B, the indication for which Hepsera has been developed. We may obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained for those products. Because patents have a limited life, which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of the patent may be limited. However, we may be able to apply for patent term extensions in some countries. Generic manufacturers have sought and may continue to seek FDA approval to market generic versions of our products through an ANDA, the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. Please see a description of our ANDA litigation in "Legal Proceedings" beginning on page 38.Our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. If we infringe the patents of others, we may be prevented from commercializing products or may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties. We may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain these licenses or alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products. For example, we are aware of a body of patents that may relate to our operation of LEAP, our restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis. We own patents that claim GS-7977 as a chemical entity and its metabolites. However, the existence of issued patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have or obtain rights to patents which they may claim could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing the patented product candidates obtained from the Pharmasset acquisition. For example, we are aware of patents and patent applications owned by other parties that might be alleged to cover the use of GS-7977. If these other parties are successful in obtaining valid and enforceable patents, and establishing our infringement of those patents, we could be prevented from selling GS-7977 unless we were able to obtain a license under such patents. If any license is needed it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In some instances, we may be required to defend our right to a patent on an invention through an Interference proceeding before the PTO. An Interference is an administrative proceeding before the PTO designed to determine who was the first to invent the subject matter being claimed by both parties. In February 2012, we received notice that the PTO had declared an Interference between our U.S. Patent No. 7,429,572 and Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s (Idenix) pending patent application no. 12/131868. An Interference is an administrative proceeding before the PTO designed to determine who was the first to invent the subject matter being claimed by both parties. Our patent covers metabolites of GS-7977 and RG7128. Idenix is attempting to claim a class of compounds, including these metabolites, in their pending patent application. In the course of this proceeding, both parties will be called upon to submit evidence of the date they conceived of their respective inventions. The Interference will determine who was first to invent these compounds and therefore who is entitled to the patent claiming these compounds. If the administrative law judge determines Idenix is entitled to these patent claims and it is determined that we have infringed those claims, we may be required to obtain a license from, and pay royalties to, Idenix to commercialize GS-7977 and RG7128. Any determination by the judge can be challenged by either party in U.S. Federal Court.In June 2012, we met with Idenix in mandatory settlement discussions. The parties were unable to settle the Interference due to our widely divergent views on the strength of our respective positions, on whether we need a license to Idenix's patents and whether Idenix needs a license to Gilead patents to develop and manufacture its pipeline products. We believe the Idenix patents involved in the Interference and similar U.S. and foreign patents claiming the same compounds and metabolites are invalid. As a result, we filed an Impeachment Action in Canadian Federal Court to invalidate the Idenix CA2490191 patent, which is the Canadian patent that corresponds to the Idenix U.S. Patent No. 7608600 and the Idenix patent application that is the subject of the Interference. Idenix has not been awarded patents on these compound and metabolites in many territories including Europe, Japan and China. In the event such patents issue, we expect to challenge them in proceedings similar to the one we invoked in Canada. 48Furthermore, we use significant proprietary technology and rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect certain aspects of our production and other technologies. Our trade secrets may become known or independently discovered by our competitors. Manufacturing problems, including at our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners, could cause inventory shortages and delay product shipments and regulatory approvals, which may adversely affect our results of operations. In order to generate revenue from our products, we must be able to produce sufficient quantities of our products to satisfy demand. Many of our products are the result of complex manufacturing processes. The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is also highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Our products are either manufactured at our own facilities or by third-party manufacturers or corporate partners. We depend on third parties to perform manufacturing activities effectively and on a timely basis for the majority of our solid dose products. In addition, Roche, either by itself or through third parties, is responsible for manufacturing Tamiflu. We, our third-party manufacturers and our corporate partners are subject to current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards as defined by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Similar regulations are in effect in other countries. Our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners are independent entities who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks which are out of our control. If we or any of these third-party manufacturers or corporate partners fail to perform as required, this could impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis or receive royalties or cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. To the extent these risks materialize and affect their performance obligations to us, our financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, we, our third-party manufacturers and our corporate partners may only be able to produce some of our products at one or a limited number of facilities and, therefore, have limited manufacturing capacity for certain products. For example, due to unexpected delays both in qualifying two new external sites and with expanding Cayston manufacturing in San Dimas, we cannot supply enough Cayston to fulfill our projected demand. In February 2012, we suspended access for patients with new prescriptions for Cayston subject to certain exceptions where specific medical need exists. Patients may use other alternative treatment options until we are able to resolve the supply shortage. As a result of our inability to manufacture sufficient Cayston to meet demand, the amount of revenues we expect to receive from the sale of Cayston will be reduced. Our manufacturing operations are subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies. For example, in January and February 2010, the FDA conducted a routine inspection of our San Dimas manufacturing facility, where we exclusively manufacture Cayston and AmBisome and fill and finish Macugen. At the conclusion of that inspection, the FDA issued Form 483 Inspectional Observations stating concerns over: the maintenance of aseptic processing conditions in the manufacturing suite for our AmBisome product; environmental maintenance issues in the San Dimas warehousing facility; batch sampling; and the timeliness of completion of annual product quality reports. On September 24, 2010, our San Dimas manufacturing facility received a Warning Letter from the FDA further detailing the FDA's concerns over the AmBisome manufacturing environment, including control systems and monitoring, procedures to prevent microbiological contamination and preventative cleaning and equipment maintenance. Referencing certain Viread lots, the letter also stated concerns connected with quality procedures, controls and investigation procedures, and a generalized concern over the effectiveness of the San Dimas quality unit in carrying out its responsibilities. In November and December 2010, the FDA re-inspected the San Dimas facility. The re-inspection closed with no additional Form 483 observations. In August 2011, the FDA notified us that we resolved all issues raised by the FDA in its Warning Letter. Our ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize Cayston will depend upon our ability to manufacture in a multi-product facility. Aztreonam, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Cayston, is a mono-bactam Gram-negative antibiotic. We manufacture Cayston by ourselves in San Dimas, California, or through third parties, in multi-product manufacturing facilities. Historically, the FDA has permitted the manufacture of mono-bactams in multi-product manufacturing facilities; however, there can be no assurance that the FDA will continue to allow this practice. We do not currently have a single-product facility that can be dedicated to the manufacture of Cayston nor have we engaged a contract manufacturer with a single-product facility for Cayston. If the FDA prohibits the manufacture of mono-bactam antibiotics, like aztreonam, in multi-product manufacturing facilities in the future, we may not be able to procure a single-product manufacturing facility in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our commercial supplies of Cayston and our anticipated financial results attributable to such product. 49We may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, which would limit our ability to generate revenues. We need access to certain supplies and products to conduct our clinical trials and to manufacture our products. In light of the global economic downturn, we have had increased difficulty in purchasing certain of the raw materials used in our manufacturing process. If we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of these materials or find suitable alternate materials in a timely manner, our development efforts for our product candidates may be delayed or our ability to manufacture our products would be limited, which would limit our ability to generate revenues. Suppliers of key components and materials must be named in an NDA filed with the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authority for any product candidate for which we are seeking marketing approval, and significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required. Even after a manufacturer is qualified by the regulatory authority, the manufacturer must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with GMP. Manufacturers are subject to regular, periodic inspections by the regulatory authorities following initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, a regulatory authority determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, the regulatory authority may suspend the manufacturing operations. If the manufacturing operations of any of the single suppliers for our products are suspended, we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of product to meet market demand, which would in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business. In addition, if delivery of material from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason, we may be unable to ship certain of our products for commercial supply or to supply our products in development for clinical trials. In addition, some of our products and the materials that we utilize in our operations are made at only one facility. For example, we manufacture AmBisome and fill and finish Macugen exclusively at our facilities in San Dimas, California. In the event of a disaster, including an earthquake, equipment failure or other difficulty, we may be unable to replace this manufacturing capacity in a timely manner and may be unable to manufacture AmBisome and Macugen to meet market needs. Cayston is dependent on two different third-party single-source suppliers. First, aztreonam, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in aztreonam for inhalation solution, is manufactured by a single supplier at a single site. Second, it is administered to the lungs of patients through a device that is made by a single supplier at a single site. Disruptions or delays with any of these single suppliers could adversely affect our ability to supply Cayston, and we cannot be sure that alternative suppliers can be identified in a timely manner, or at all. See the Risk Factor entitled “Our ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize Cayston will depend upon our ability to manufacture in a multi-product facility.” In addition, we depend on a single supplier for high-quality cholesterol, which is used in the manufacture of AmBisome. We also rely on a single source for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Hepsera, Letairis and Vistide and for the tableting of Letairis. Astellas US LLC, which markets Lexiscan in the United States, is responsible for the commercial manufacture and supply of product in the United States and is dependent on a single supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Lexiscan. Problems with any of the single suppliers we depend on may negatively impact our development and commercialization efforts. A significant portion of the raw materials and intermediates used to manufacture our HIV products (Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Complera/Eviplera, Emtriva) are supplied by Chinese-based companies. As a result, an international trade dispute between China and the United States or any other actions by the Chinese government that would limit or prevent Chinese companies from supplying these materials would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our HIV products to meet market needs and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results. We face credit risks from our Southern European customers that may adversely affect our results of operations. Our European product sales to government-owned or supported customers in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have historically been and continue to be subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. This has resulted and may continue to result in days sales outstanding being significantly higher in these countries due to the average length of time that accounts receivable remain outstanding. 50As of June 30, 2012, our accounts receivable in these countries totaled approximately $791.8 million of which, $291.4 million were past due greater than 120 days and $114.6 million were past due greater than 365 days as follows (in thousands): June 30, 2012 Greater than120 dayspast due Greater than365 dayspast duePortugal$139,276 $60,815Italy103,312 40,528Spain30,856 10,769Greece17,958 2,499Total$291,402 $114,611As a result of the fiscal and debt crises in these countries, the number of days our invoices are past due has continued to increase in line with that being experienced by other pharmaceutical companies that are also selling directly to hospitals. Historically, receivable balances with certain publicly-owned hospitals accumulate over a period of time and are then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments. If significant changes were to occur in the reimbursement practices of these European governments or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from these customers and our results of operations would be adversely affected. In 2011, the Greek government settled substantially all of its outstanding receivables subject to the bond settlement with zero-coupon bonds that traded at a discount to face value. In March 2012, the Greek government restructured its sovereign debt which impacted all holders of Greek bonds. As a result, we recorded a $40.1 million loss. In June 2012, we received payment on $460.6 million accounts receivable from customers in Spain that were past due six months or more.Our revenues and gross margin could be reduced by imports from countries where our products are available at lower prices. Prices for our products are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country. Our sales in countries with relatively higher prices may be reduced if products can be imported into those or other countries from lower price markets. There have been cases in which other pharmaceutical products were sold at steeply discounted prices in the developing world and then re-exported to European countries where they could be re-sold at much higher prices. If this happens with our products, particularly Truvada and Viread, which we have agreed to make available at substantially reduced prices to 134 countries participating in our Gilead Access Program, or Atripla, which Merck distributes at substantially reduced prices to HIV infected patients in developing countries under our 2006 agreement, our revenues would be adversely affected. In addition, we have established partnerships with thirteen Indian generic manufacturers to distribute high-quality, low-cost generic versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to 112 developing world countries, including India. If generic versions of our medications under these licenses are then re-exported to the United States, Europe or other markets outside of these 112 countries, our revenues would be adversely affected. In addition, purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively high may adversely impact our revenues and gross margin and may cause our sales to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For example, in the European Union, we are required to permit products purchased in one country to be sold in another country. Purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively high affect the inventory level held by our wholesalers and can cause the relative sales levels in the various countries to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and not reflect the actual consumer demand in any given quarter. These quarterly fluctuations may impact our earnings, which could adversely affect our stock price and harm our business. Expensive litigation and government investigations have reduced and may continue to reduce our earnings. We are involved in a number of litigation, investigation and other dispute-related matters that require us to expend substantial internal and financial resources. We expect these matters will continue to require a high level of internal and financial resources for the foreseeable future. These matters have reduced and will continue to reduce our earnings. Please see a description of our Department of Justice investigation; Interference and litigation proceedings with Idenix; ANDA litigation with generic manufacturers; and contract arbitration with Jeremy Clark in "Legal Proceedings" beginning on page 38. 51The outcome of the lawsuits above, or any other lawsuits that may be brought against us, the investigation or any other investigations that may be initiated, are inherently uncertain, and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant expenses, monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us that could significantly reduce our earnings and cash flows and harm our business.In some countries, we may be required to grant compulsory licenses for our products or face generic competition for our products. In a number of developing countries, government officials and other interested groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs for HIV infection available at low cost. Alternatively, governments in those developing countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products, thereby reducing our product sales. For example, in the past, certain offices of the government of Brazil have expressed concern over the affordability of our HIV products and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory licenses to permit the manufacture of otherwise patented products for HIV infection, including Viread. In July 2009, the Brazilian patent authority rejected our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viread. This was the highest level of appeal available to us within the Brazilian patent authority. Because we do not currently have a patent in Brazil, the Brazilian government now purchases its supply of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate from generic manufacturers.In addition, concerns over the cost and availability of Tamiflu related to a potential avian flu pandemic and H1N1 influenza generated international discussions over compulsory licensing of our Tamiflu patents. For example, the Canadian government considered allowing Canadian manufacturers to manufacture and export the active ingredient in Tamiflu to eligible developing and least developed countries under Canada's Access to Medicines Regime. Furthermore, Roche issued voluntary licenses to permit third-party manufacturing of Tamiflu. For example, Roche granted a sublicense to Shanghai Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. for China and a sublicense to India's Hetero Drugs Limited for India and certain developing countries. Should one or more compulsory licenses be issued permitting generic manufacturing to override our Tamiflu patents, or should Roche issue additional voluntary licenses to permit third-party manufacturing of Tamiflu, those developments could reduce royalties we receive from Roche's sales of Tamiflu. Certain countries do not permit enforcement of our patents, and third-party manufacturers are able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries. Compulsory licenses or sales of generic versions of our products could significantly reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if generic versions of our products are imported into territories where we have existing commercial sales. Changes in royalty revenue disproportionately affect our pre-tax income, earnings per share and gross margins. A portion of our revenues is derived from royalty revenues recognized from collaboration agreements with third parties. Royalty revenues impact our pre-tax income, earnings per share and gross margins disproportionately more than their contributions to our revenues. Any increase or decrease to our royalty revenue could be material and could significantly impact our operating results. For example, we recognized $75.5 million in royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 related to royalties received from sales of Tamiflu by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche). Although such royalty revenue represented approximately 1% of our total revenues in 2011, it represented approximately 2% of our pre-tax income during the period. Roche's Tamiflu sales have unpredictable variability due to their strong relationship with global pandemic planning efforts. Tamiflu royalties increased sharply in 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 primarily as a result of pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Tamiflu royalties since the second quarter of 2010 have decreased due to declining pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. We may face significant liability resulting from our products that may not be covered by insurance and successful claims could materially reduce our earnings. The testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our commercial products, as well as product candidates in development, involve substantial risk of product liability claims. These claims may be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others. In recent years, coverage and availability of cost-effective product liability insurance has decreased, so we may be unable to maintain sufficient coverage for product liabilities that may arise. In addition, the cost to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims may exceed our coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate coverage or if claims exceed our coverage, our financial condition and our ability to clinically test our product candidates and market our products will be adversely impacted. In addition, negative publicity associated with any claims, regardless of their merit, may decrease the future demand for our products and impair our financial condition. Business disruptions from natural or man-made disasters may harm our future revenues. Our worldwide operations could be subject to business interruptions stemming from natural or man-made disasters for which we may be self-insured. Our corporate headquarters and Fremont locations, which together house a majority of our 52research and development activities, and our San Dimas and Oceanside manufacturing facilities are located in California, a seismically active region. As we do not carry earthquake insurance and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake. Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, our portion of the non-deductible pharmaceutical excise tax, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, mergers and acquisitions, future levels of R&D spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings and resolution of federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2008 and 2009 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. If we fail to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop new product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates. Our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, governmental regulation and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense, and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms. If we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts, our business may be harmed. 53ITEM 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
