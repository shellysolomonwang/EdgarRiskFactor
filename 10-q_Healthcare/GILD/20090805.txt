Item 1A. Risk Factors”) included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars.  Management Overview  We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need. Our mission is to advance the care of patients suffering from life threatening diseases worldwide. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America, Europe and Australia. We market Truvada® (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), Atripla® (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), Viread® (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and Emtriva® (emtricitabine) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; Hepsera® (adefovir dipivoxil) and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV); AmBisome® (amphotericin B) liposome for injection for the treatment of severe fungal infections; Letairis® (ambrisentan) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Ranexa® (ranolazine) for the treatment of chronic angina; and Vistide® (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate) for the treatment and prevention of influenza under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. markets Macugen® (pegaptanib sodium injection) in the United States and Europe for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK) markets Volibris™ (ambrisentan) outside of the United States for the treatment of PAH under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. Menarini International Operations Luxembourg SA markets Ranexa outside of the United States under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. Astellas Pharma US, Inc. markets Lexiscan® (regadenoson) injection in the United States for use as a pharmacologic stress agent in radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us.    26    Table of Contents Business Highlights  In July 2009, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Tibotec Pharmaceuticals (Tibotec), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, to develop and commercialize a new once-daily fixed-dose combination containing our Truvada and Tibotec’s investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, TMC278 (25 mg rilpivirine hydrochloride), which is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials. We will pay up to €71.5 million (approximately $100.0 million) of Tibotec’s development costs for TMC278. We expect to recognize product sales revenue from future sales of this new combination product if and when it is approved. The cost of TMC278 purchased by us from Tibotec for the combination product will approximate the market price of TMC278, less a specified percentage of up to 30%.  With regard to our antiviral research and development (R&D) efforts, in April 2009, we initiated a Phase 2 study of a complete single-tablet fixed-dose regimen containing elvitegravir, GS 9350 and Truvada in treatment-naïve patients. In April 2009, we also initiated a Phase 2 study of GS 9350-boosted atazanavir compared to ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, each in combination with Truvada. Both studies were fully enrolled during the second quarter of 2009.  In the cardiovascular area, in April 2009, we announced preliminary data from DAR-311 (DORADO), a Phase 3 clinical study for darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension. In May 2009, we announced results from ARIES-3, an open-label, single-arm, Phase 3 clinical study of ambrisentan in patients with pulmonary hypertension. In May 2009, our marketing authorisation application (MAA) for regadenoson, an investigational pharmacologic stress agent for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging, was validated by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and is being formally reviewed by members of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the scientific committee of the EMEA.  With regard to our respiratory efforts, in June 2009, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion on our MAA for aztreonam lysine 75 mg powder and solvent for nebulizer solution for the suppressive therapy of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 18 years and older. The CHMP’s positive recommendation will be reviewed by the European Commission, and we anticipate that the European Commission will issue its decision later in 2009.  Acquisition of CV Therapeutics, Inc. and Restructuring  In April 2009, we completed the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, Inc. (CV Therapeutics), a publicly held biopharmaceutical company based in Palo Alto, California, primarily focused on applying molecular cardiology to the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. CV Therapeutics had two marketed products as well as several product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary diseases and diabetes. We believe the acquisition will provide us with an opportunity to further expand into the cardiovascular therapeutic area. We adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), in recognizing the consideration transferred of $1.39 billion and recorded $951.2 million and $180.1 million in intangible assets relating to marketed products and in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects, respectively, which constituted a significant portion of the assets acquired from CV Therapeutics. The results of operations of CV Therapeutics beginning on April 15, 2009, the acquisition date, were included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended June 30, 2009.  During the three months ended June 30, 2009, we also approved a plan to realize certain synergies between us and CV Therapeutics, re-align our cardiovascular operations and eliminate certain redundancies. The restructuring plan includes the consolidation and re-alignment of the cardiovascular R&D organization, the exit from certain of our facilities and the termination of certain contractual obligations. As a result of this restructuring plan, we recorded an aggregate of $24.1 million in expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2009, primarily related to employee severance and termination benefits costs in accordance with SFAS No. 146,     27    Table of Contents  Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. We expect the total amount to be incurred in connection with the significant activities of our restructuring plan to be approximately $30 million for employee severance and termination benefits and $25 million for facilities-related costs. These costs are expected to be incurred through 2010 with the majority of the expenses to be incurred by the end of 2009.  Financial Highlights  Our operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2009 were led by total product sales of $1.57 billion. Antiviral product sales (Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva) increased 26% to $1.41 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2009 from the three months ended June 30, 2008, and were the key drivers for total product sales growth of 29% for the three months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2008. Atripla contributed $569.1 million, or 40%, to our second quarter 2009 antiviral product sales, which included the launch of the product in France. The growth of Atripla product sales and its increased proportion relative to our overall product sales caused our product gross margin to decrease to 76% for the three months ended June 30, 2009 from 78% in the same period of 2008, due primarily to the efavirenz component of Atripla sales which is recorded at zero gross margin. Truvada product sales for the three months ended June 30, 2009 comprised $608.1 million, or 43% of our second quarter 2009 antiviral product sales. Truvada product sales for the three months ended June 30, 2009 increased 18% from the three months ended June 30, 2008 primarily due to continued sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. Foreign currency fluctuations for the three months ended June 30, 2009 had an unfavorable impact of approximately $50.0 million on total revenues and $18.4 million on pre-tax income when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2008.  Royalty, contract and other revenues that we recognized from our collaborations with corporate partners were $78.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009, an increase of 29% from the three months ended June 30, 2008. The increase was driven primarily by higher Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $51.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009 compared to Tamiflu royalties of $37.5 million in the same period in 2008 due to increased sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide.  Operating expenses which include R&D and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $107.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009, or 27%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2008, reflecting the incremental operating expenses associated with our acquisition of CV Therapeutics, higher headcount required to support the continued growth of our business, severance and termination benefits costs incurred as a result of our restructuring activities as well as the increased clinical study activity related to product candidates in our pipeline.  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by $341.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2009, driven primarily by the cash used to acquire CV Therapeutics of $1.13 billion, net of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities assumed from CV Therapeutics of $245.4 million, partially offset by operating cash flows of $1.26 billion. During the six months ended June 30, 2009, we repurchased a total of $468.0 million of our common stock through open market purchases, or approximately 10.3 million shares. As of June 30, 2009, the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under our $3.00 billion Board-authorized stock repurchase program which expires in December 2010 was $530.0 million.  Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments  Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments” included in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.  Intangible Assets  In conjunction with the business combinations that we have completed, we recorded intangible assets primarily related to marketed products, IPR&D projects and goodwill as part of our recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Identifiable intangible assets such as those     28    Table of Contents  related to marketed products or IPR&D projects, are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We have adopted the provisions of SFAS 141R for measuring and recognizing intangible assets that were acquired after January 1, 2009. We believe the fair values assigned to our acquired intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. Discounted cash flow models are used in valuing these intangible assets, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:        •    estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates;        •    the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;        •    the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;        •    the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory approvals; and        •    risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.  Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the assets below their carrying amounts. As of June 30, 2009, we had $617.6 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets consisting of $437.5 million of goodwill resulting from various business combinations and $180.1 million of intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects that we acquired from CV Therapeutics.  In accordance with SFAS 142, intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. With respect to intangible assets related to the marketed products that we acquired from CV Therapeutics, we are amortizing the intangible asset related to Ranexa over its estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product sales for Ranexa. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, we will prospectively update the rate used to amortize our intangible asset related to Ranexa which may increase future cost of goods sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to Lexiscan over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. Given that current Lexiscan revenues consist of royalties received from a collaboration partner and we will have limited ongoing access and visibility into that partner’s future sales forecasts, we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amortization rate utilizing a forecasted product sales approach. As of June 30, 2009, we had $953.2 million of net unamortized finite-lived intangible assets consisting primarily of intangible assets related to the marketed products that we acquired from CV Therapeutics.  Our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on our historical and projected future operating results, our extent or manner of use of the acquired assets, legal and regulatory factors and events, our overall business strategy and market and economic trends. If events occur in the future that cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangible assets are impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.  Other than as set forth herein, there have been no other material changes in our critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments during the three months ended June 30, 2009 compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.    29    Table of Contents Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements  On April 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (FSP FAS 157-4) on a prospective basis. FSP FAS 157-4 provides additional guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability. FSP FAS 157-4 supersedes FSP FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active, and is applicable to the valuation of auction rate securities held by us for which there was no active market as of June 30, 2009.  On April 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments (FSP FAS 115-2) on a prospective basis for available-for-sale securities. FSP FAS 115-2 provides new guidance on the recognition and presentation of an other-than-temporary impairment, provides some new disclosure requirements as well as extends certain annual disclosure requirements to interim periods. FSP FAS 115-2 is effective for interim periods and fiscal years ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009.  On April 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (FSP FAS 107-1) on a prospectus basis for our financial instruments. FSP 107-1 extends the disclosure requirements regarding the fair value of financial instruments under FAS No. 107, Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to interim financial statements of publicly traded companies. FSP FAS 107-1 is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009  In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141R. SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree in a business combination. SFAS 141R also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination; requires purchased IPR&D to be capitalized at fair value as intangible assets at the time of acquisition; requires acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs to be recognized separately from the business combination; expands the definition of what constitutes a business; and requires the acquirer to disclose information that users may need to evaluate and understand the financial effect of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. On January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 141R on a prospective basis and applied it to the acquisition of CV Therapeutics.  On January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161) on a prospective basis for our derivative instruments. SFAS 161 is intended to improve financial reporting of derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures to enable financial statement users to better understand the effects of derivatives and hedging on an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows in the context of an entity’s risk exposures. SFAS 161 is effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. On January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of FSP Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1) on a retrospective basis for our convertible senior notes. FSP APB 14-1 requires us to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible senior notes separately by bifurcating the conversion option from the debt instrument, classifying the conversion option in equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt. Accordingly, we reflected additional interest expense of $13.3 million and $26.2 million, respectively, a related benefit from income taxes of $5.2 million and $10.3 million, respectively, and net income per share attributable to Gilead common stockholders on a diluted basis of $0.01 and $0.02, respectively, for the three and six months     30    Table of Contents  ended June 30, 2008 in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income, and recorded additional interest expense of $14.0 million and $27.6 million, respectively, a related benefit from income taxes of $5.5 million and $10.9 million, respectively, and net income per share attributable to Gilead common stockholders on a diluted basis of $0.01 and $0.02, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009. In addition, the retrospective adoption of FSP APB 14-1 decreased deferred tax assets and debt issuance costs included in other assets by an aggregate of $81.7 million, decreased convertible senior notes, net included in long-term liabilities by $201.8 million and increased total stockholders’ equity by $120.1 million after a charge of $82.6 million to retained earnings in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008.  On January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). Accordingly, we reclassified the noncontrolling interest (formerly minority interest) from liabilities to stockholders’ equity on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets on a retrospective basis, which resulted in the reclassification of the change in noncontrolling interest from net cash provided by operating activities to net cash used in financing activities on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We also presented the noncontrolling interest on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, a component of consolidated net income, on a retrospective basis.  Results of Operations  Total Revenues  We had total revenues of $1.65 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2009 compared to $1.28 billion for the same period in 2008. We had total revenues of $3.18 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and $2.54 billion for the same period in 2008. Included in total revenues were product sales, royalty revenues and contract and other revenues.  Product Sales  The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands, except percentages):                              Three Months EndedJune 30,         Six Months EndedJune 30,            2009   2008   Change     2009   2008   Change     Antiviral products:                           Truvada   $ 608,079   $ 516,149   18 %    $ 1,198,432   $ 995,534   20 %    Atripla     569,142     355,101   60 %      1,079,025     679,318   59 %    Viread     158,925     150,681   5 %      319,530     303,348   5 %    Hepsera     67,074     90,365   (26 )%      139,788     173,387   (19 )%    Emtriva     7,096     8,088   (12 )%      14,272     16,477   (13 )%                                      Total antiviral products     1,410,316     1,120,384   26 %      2,751,047     2,168,064   27 %    AmBisome     73,310     69,768   5 %      137,581     140,796   (2 )%    Letairis     44,128     24,686   79 %      83,708     45,023   86 %    Ranexa     36,065     —    100 %      36,065     —    100 %    Other     4,559     2,378   92 %      7,557     4,639   63 %                                      Total product sales   $ 1,568,378   $ 1,217,216   29 %    $ 3,015,958   $ 2,358,522   28 %                                     Total product sales increased by 29% and 28% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2008, due primarily to an overall increase in our antiviral product sales, including the strong growth in sales of Atripla and Truvada. A significant percentage of our product sales continued to be denominated in foreign currencies. We used foreign currency exchange forward and option     31    Table of Contents  contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. This reduced, but did not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Antiviral Products  Antiviral product sales increased by 26% and 27% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth of Atripla and Truvada.        •    Truvada   Truvada sales increased by 18% and 20% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. Truvada sales accounted for 43% and 44% of our total antiviral product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively.        •    Atripla   Atripla sales increased by 60% and 59% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe including the launch of Atripla in France in the second quarter of 2009. Atripla sales include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin. The efavirenz portion of our Atripla sales was approximately $208.0 million and $395.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, and approximately $130.5 million and $250.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively. Atripla sales accounted for 40% and 39% of our total antiviral product sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively.        •    Other Antiviral Products  Other antiviral product sales, which include product sales of Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva decreased by six percent and four percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2008, driven primarily by sales volume decreases in Hepsera, partially offset by sales volume increases in Viread.  Letairis  Sales of Letairis increased by 79% and 86% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States.  Ranexa  Sales of Ranexa were $36.1 million from April 15, 2009 (the date of our acquisition of CV Therapeutics) to June 30, 2009.  Royalty Revenues  The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands, except percentages):                              Three Months EndedJune 30,         Six Months EndedJune 30,            2009   2008   Change     2009   2008   Change     Royalty revenues   $ 73,895   $ 50,608   46 %    $ 126,937   $ 160,060   (21 )%   Royalty revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2009 were $73.9 million, an increase of 46% compared to the same period in 2008, driven primarily by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $51.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2009, compared to Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $37.5     32    Table of Contents  million recognized in the same period in 2008. The higher Tamiflu royalties were due primarily to increased Roche sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Royalty revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2009 were $126.9 million, a decrease of 21% compared to the same period in 2008, driven primarily by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $85.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $130.9 million recognized in the same period in 2008. The lower Tamiflu royalties were due primarily to decreased Roche sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which the product is sold.  Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin  The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our total product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin:                                  Three Months EndedJune 30,     Change     Six Months EndedJune 30,     Change      2009     2008       2009     2008       Total product sales   $ 1,568,378     $ 1,217,216     29 %    $ 3,015,958     $ 2,358,522     28 %    Cost of goods sold   $ 383,045     $ 265,684     44 %    $ 712,459     $ 505,532     41 %    Product gross margin     76 %      78 %          76 %      79 %       Our product gross margin for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 was 76%, compared to 78% and 79% for the same periods in 2008, respectively. The lower product gross margins for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 were due primarily to the higher proportion of Atripla sales, which include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin as well as the amortization associated with the intangible assets related to the marketed products acquired in our acquisition of CV Therapeutics.  Restructuring  During the three months ended June 30, 2009, we approved a plan to realize certain synergies between us and CV Therapeutics to re-align our cardiovascular operations and eliminate certain redundancies. The restructuring plan includes the consolidation and re-alignment of the cardiovascular R&D organization, the exit from certain of our facilities and the termination of certain contractual obligations. As a result of this restructuring plan, we recorded $12.9 million and $11.2 million in SG&A expenses and R&D expenses, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2009, primarily related to employee severance and termination benefits costs in accordance with SFAS No. 146. We expect the total amount to be incurred in connection with the significant activities of our restructuring plan to be approximately $30 million for employee severance and termination benefits and $25 million for facilities-related costs. These costs are expected to be incurred through 2010 with the majority of the expenses to be incurred by the end of 2009.  Research and Development Expenses  The following table summarizes the period over period changes in the major components of our R&D expenses (in thousands):                              Three Months EndedJune 30,         Six Months EndedJune 30,            2009   2008   Change     2009   2008   Change     Research   $ 48,264   $ 40,757   18 %    $ 92,262   $ 75,266   23 %    Clinical development     156,248     109,987   42 %      271,320     204,755   33 %    Pharmaceutical development     37,126     25,798   44 %      66,835     51,822   29 %                                      Total research and development   $ 241,638   $ 176,542   37 %    $ 430,417   $ 331,843   30 %                                       33    Table of Contents R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. Our R&D activities are separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs. Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials. Pharmaceutical development expenses consist of costs for product formulation and chemical analysis.  R&D expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2009 increased by $65.1 million, or 37%, compared to the same period in 2008, due primarily to increased compensation and benefit expenses of $34.1 million driven primarily by higher headcount related to the acquisition of CV Therapeutics and the growth of our business, as well as severance and termination benefits associated with our restructuring activities of $9.1 million; and increased clinical study expenses of $8.6 million primarily in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas.  R&D expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2009 increased by $98.6 million, or 30%, compared to the same period in 2008, due primarily to increased compensation and benefit expenses of $47.9 million driven primarily by higher headcount related to the acquisition of CV Therapeutics and the growth of our business, as well as severance and termination benefits associated with our restructuring activities of $9.1 million; and increased clinical study expenses of $18.6 million primarily in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  The following summarizes the period over period changes in our SG&A expenses (in thousands):                              Three Months EndedJune 30,         Six Months EndedJune 30,            2009   2008   Change     2009   2008   Change     Selling, general and administrative   $ 261,411   $ 219,533   19 %    $ 465,362   $ 414,490   12 %   SG&A expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2009 increased by $41.9 million, or 19%, compared to the same period of 2008, due primarily to increased compensation and benefit expenses of $25.4 million driven primarily by higher headcount related to the acquisition of CV Therapeutics and the growth of our business, as well as severance and termination benefits associated with our restructuring activities of $12.3 million; and acquisition-related transaction costs of $8.2 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2008, we incurred costs of $12.4 million associated with certain employee termination-related disputes in our international operations.  SG&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2009 increased by $50.9 million, or 12%, compared to the same period in 2008, due primarily to increased compensation and benefit expenses of $38.0 million driven primarily by higher headcount related to the acquisition of CV Therapeutics and the growth of our business, as well as severance and termination benefits associated with our restructuring activities of $12.3 million; and acquisition-related transaction costs of $8.2 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2008, we incurred costs of $12.4 million associated with certain employee termination-related disputes in our international operations.  Interest and Other Income, Net   Interest and other income, net, was $12.9 million and $17.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, a decrease of $1.1 million and $19.6 million from the same periods in 2008, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 was due primarily to decreased interest income of $9.4 million due primarily to a reduction in the average yield of our investment portfolio as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by decreased costs related to our hedging     34    Table of Contents  activities of $7.8 million. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 was due primarily to decreased interest income of $19.5 million due primarily to a reduction in the average yield of our investment portfolio as a result of lower interest rates and increased costs related to our hedging activities of $7.1 million, partially offset by net foreign currency exchange gains of $9.3 million.  Provision for Income Taxes  Our income tax rate was 24.7% and 25.5% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, compared to 28.3% and 28.1% for the same periods in 2008, respectively. Our provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 was $186.4 million and $395.6 million, respectively, compared to $170.5 million and $358.8 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008. The tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with tax authorities and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be permanently reinvested.  Purchased In-process Research and Development  In connection with our acquisition of CV Therapeutics in April 2009, we recorded intangible assets of $180.1 million related to the IPR&D projects that we acquired from CV Therapeutics. Of the $180.1 million of intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects, $93.4 million related to CVT-3619, a product candidate in Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. The remaining balance of the intangible assets related to IPR&D projects represented various other in-process projects with no single project comprising a significant portion of the total value. In accordance with SFAS 141R and SFAS 142, intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time.  The estimated fair value of the intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects acquired from CV Therapeutics was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the fair value of these intangible assets using a present value discount rate of 9%, which is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles substantially similar to that of CV Therapeutics. This is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for CV Therapeutics’ operations and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets. We compensated for the differing phases of development of each project by probability-adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows associated with each project. We then determine the present value of the expected future cash flows using the discount rate of 9%. The projected cash flows from the IPR&D projects were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidates; the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.  In connection with our acquisition of the cicletanine assets from Navitas in 2008, we recorded IPR&D expense of $10.9 million during the three months ended June 30, 2008 in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combination (SFAS 141). As we do not consider the acquisition to be a material purchase, we have not made further disclosures regarding the related purchased IPR&D.    35    Table of Contents In connection with our acquisitions of Myogen Inc. (Myogen) and Corus Pharma, Inc. (Corus) in 2006, we recorded purchased IPR&D expenses of $2.06 billion and $335.6 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2006 in accordance with SFAS 141.  The purchased IPR&D expense for Myogen represented the estimated fair value of Myogen’s incomplete R&D programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. A summary of these programs at the acquisition date, updated for subsequent changes in status of development, is as follows:                Program    Description    Status of Development   EstimatedAcquisition DateFair Value(in millions)   Ambrisentan   An orally active, non-sulfonamide, propanoic acid-class, endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) for the treatment of PAH.   Phase 3 clinical trials were completed prior to the acquisition date. We filed an new drug application (NDA) with the FDA in December 2006 and, in June 2007, the FDA approved Letairis for the treatment of PAH in the United States. Additionally, in March 2007, the EMEA validated the MAA for ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH, filed by our collaboration partner, GSK. In April 2008, the European Commission granted GSK marketing authorization for ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH, which is marketed under the name Volibris by GSK.   $ 1,413.7        Darusentan   An orally active ETA-selective ERA for the treatment of resistant hypertension.   In Phase 3 clinical development as of the acquisition date and the date of this filing.   $ 644.5  The remaining efforts for completing the darusentan IPR&D program consist primarily of clinical trials, the cost, length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict, and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. Numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development, including the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. Feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical trials might require modifications to or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed. We cannot be certain that darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension will be approved in the United States or in countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. Future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for review, which may differ materially from current projections. Darusentan may never be successfully commercialized. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of darusentan if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If this program cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of this project will materialize as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.    36    Table of Contents The purchased IPR&D expense for Corus represented the estimated fair value of Corus’s incomplete aztreonam for inhalation solution for CF IPR&D program that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. A description of this program at the acquisition date, updated for subsequent changes in status of development, is as follows:                Program    Description    Status of Development   EstimatedAcquisition DateFair Value(in millions)  Aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of CF   Aztreonam formulation for inhalation to be used against Gram-negative bacteria that cause lung infections in patients with CF.   In Phase 3 clinical trials as of the acquisition date. We filed an NDA with the FDA in November 2007. In September 2008, we received a complete response letter from the FDA informing us that the FDA will not approve our NDA for aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of CF in its current form and requesting we conduct an additional Phase 3 clinical study. In November 2008, we filed a request for a formal dispute resolution with the FDA. In February 2009, in response to our appeal, the FDA notified us that it was reiterating its position that we will need to conduct another clinical study of aztreonam for inhalation solution before we can resubmit our NDA. In March 2008, we also submitted a MAA in the European Union and received notice of acceptance and priority review by Health Canada for approval in Canada. In March 2009, the CHMP notified us that it adopted a negative opinion on our MAA. In June 2009, the CHMP notified us that it adopted a positive opinion on the MAA for aztreonam lysine 75 mg powder and solvent for nebuliser solution for the suppressive therapy of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with CF aged 18 years and older. The CHMP’s positive recommendation will be reviewed by the European Commission, and we anticipate that the European Commission will issue its decision later in 2009.   $ 335.6  The remaining efforts for completing Corus’s IPR&D program consist primarily of clinical trials, the cost, length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict. Numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development, including the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trial and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. We cannot be certain that aztreonam for     37    Table of Contents  inhalation solution for the treatment of CF will be approved in the United States or in countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital, and our cash flow activity (in thousands):                    June 30,2009     December 31,2008     Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities   $ 2,898,446     $ 3,239,639     Working capital   $ 2,223,425     $ 3,057,416           Six Months EndedJune 30,        2009     2008     Cash provided by (used in):             Operating activities   $ 1,264,247     $ 1,046,581     Investing activities   $ (1,391,567 )    $ (98,316 )    Financing activities   $ (302,034 )    $ (753,192 )   Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.90 billion at June 30, 2009, a decrease of $341.2 million or 11% from December 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily attributable to:        •    cash used to acquire CV Therapeutics of $1.13 billion, net of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities assumed from CV Therapeutics of $245.4 million;        •    $468.2 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; and        •    $305.4 million used to extinguish the convertible senior notes we assumed in our acquisition of CV Therapeutics.  This decrease was partially offset by the following:        •    net cash provided by operations of $1.26 billion;        •    proceeds from our credit facility of $400.0 million; and        •    proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans of $102.1 million.  Working Capital  Working capital was $2.22 billion at June 30, 2009, a decrease of $834.0 million or 27% from December 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily attributable to:        •    a decrease of $545.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities; and        •    an increase of $400.0 million in the current portion of other long-term obligations driven by proceeds from our credit facility.    38    Table of Contents This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $219.5 million in accounts receivable, net, primarily driven by increased product sales.  Cash Provided by Operating Activities  Cash provided by operating activities of $1.26 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2009 primarily related to net income of $1.16 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $91.8 million of depreciation and amortization and $90.3 million of stock-based compensation expenses, partially offset by $140.0 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities.  Cash provided by operating activities of $1.05 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was comprised primarily of $919.0 million in net income, adjusted for non-cash items such as $129.4 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans and $73.0 million of stock-based compensation expenses. This was partially offset by $120.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises which are required to be included in cash used in financing activities in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, as well as $69.3 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Our operating cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2008 has been revised for our retrospective application of SFAS 160 on January 1, 2009, and the resulting reclassification of the change in noncontrolling interest from cash provided by operating activities to cash used in financing activities.  Cash Used in Investing Activities  Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2009 primarily related to our acquisition of CV Therapeutics, purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities as well as capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2008 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities as well as capital expenditures.  We used $1.39 billion of cash in investing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2009, compared to $98.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2008. The increase was due primarily to cash used in our acquisition of CV Therapeutics of $1.25 billion, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired and increased capital expenditures in the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Capital expenditures and other items of $184.9 million made in the six months ended June 30, 2009 related primarily to the purchase of an office building and approximately 30 acres of land located in Foster City, California.  Cash Used in Financing Activities  Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $302.0 million, driven primarily by the $468.2 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program and the $305.4 million used to extinguish the convertible senior notes assumed from the acquisition of CV Therapeutics. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $400.0 million that we borrowed under our existing revolving credit agreement to partially fund the acquisition of CV Therapeutics and proceeds of $102.1 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans.  Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $753.2 million, driven primarily by the $966.0 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program. The cash outflows were partially offset by $120.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises, as well as proceeds of $135.6 million that we received from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans.  As a result of our adoption of SFAS 160, we reclassified the changes in noncontrolling interest from cash provided by operating activities to cash used in financing activities, as discussed above.    39    Table of Contents Under our amended and restated credit agreement, we, along with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Corporation, may borrow up to an aggregate of $1.25 billion in revolving credit loans. The credit agreement also includes a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of credit. Loans under the credit agreement bear interest at an interest rate of either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.20 percent to 0.32 percent or the base rate, as defined in the credit agreement. In April 2009, in connection with the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, we borrowed $400.0 million under the credit agreement to partially fund the acquisition. The credit agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder shall be due and payable on December 17, 2012. As of June 30, 2009, approximately $846.2 million was available under our amended and restated credit agreement. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay loans under the credit agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty, subject to certain conditions. We expect to repay the $400.0 million loan within the next 12 months using cash flow generated from operations.  In October 2008, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $750.0 million of our common stock on an accelerated basis. Under the terms of this accelerated share repurchase agreement, we paid $750.0 million to settle the initial purchase transaction and received 14,874,519 shares of our common stock at a price of $50.42 per share. In March 2009, upon termination of the agreement and in accordance with the share delivery provisions of the agreement, we received an additional 1,356,337 shares of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume weighted-average prices of our common stock during a specified period less a predetermined discount per share. As a result, the total number of shares repurchased and retired under this transaction was 16,230,856 shares at an average purchase price of $46.21 per share. The accounting for this accelerated share repurchase was consistent with that of our previous accelerated share repurchase.  As of June 30, 2009, the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under our $3.00 billion Board-authorized stock repurchase program which expires in December 2010 was $530.0 million.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.      ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  There have been no material changes in our market risk during the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.  A portion of our marketable securities are held in auction rate securities. During the three months ended March 31, 2008, we began observing the failed auctions for our auction rate securities for which the underlying assets are comprised of student loans. Most of our auction rate securities, including those subject to the failed auctions, are currently rated AAA, consistent with the high quality rating required by our investment policy, are supported by the federal government as part of the Federal Family Education Loan Program, and are over-collateralized. Our auction rate securities reset every seven to 35 days with maturity dates ranging from 2023 through 2041 and have interest rates ranging from 0.6% to 1.0%. As of June 30, 2009, our auction rate securities continued to earn interest.  If auctions continue to fail for securities in which we have invested, we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par, should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities. However, based on our total cash and marketable securities position, our expected operating cash flows as well as access to funds through our credit facility, we believe that we will be able to hold these securities until there is a recovery in the auction market and the related securities, which may be at final maturity. As a result, we do not     40    Table of Contents  anticipate that the current illiquidity of these auction rate securities will have a material effect on our cash requirements or working capital.  In light of the volatility and developments that we have seen in the financial markets, we continue to review our cash equivalents and marketable securities carefully and strive to invest prudently. We believe that maintaining the primary goals of our investment policy, safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk, as well as liquidity, has protected us from many of the risks in the credit markets while allowing us to continue to meet our operating cash flow requirements as well as execute on other strategic opportunities such as the acquisition of CV Therapeutics.      ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  An evaluation as of June 30, 2009 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules as controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at June 30, 2009.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2009, and has concluded that there was no change during such quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met and, as set forth above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were sufficiently effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system were met.      PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  In November 2008, we received notice that Teva Pharmaceuticals (Teva) submitted an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Truvada. In the notice, Teva alleges that two of the patents associated with emtricitabine, U.S. Patent Numbers 6,642,245 and 6,703,396, owned by Emory University and licensed exclusively to us, are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva’s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In December 2008, we filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents. In March 2009, we received notice that Teva Pharmaceuticals submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic     41    Table of Contents  version of Atripla. In the notice, Teva alleges that the same two emtricitabine patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva’s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Atripla. In May 2009, we filed another lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, and we may spend significant resources defending these patents. If we are unsuccessful in one or both of these lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated, and the patent protection for Truvada and Atripla in the United States would be shortened to expire in 2017 instead of 2021.  Information pertaining to certain of our other legal proceedings can be found in “Part I. Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies” to the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and is incorporated by reference herein.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. A manifestation of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and, therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.  A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales of our HIV products, particularly Truvada and Atripla. If we are unable to maintain or continue increasing sales of these products, our results of operations may be adversely affected.  We are currently dependent on sales of our products for the treatment of HIV, particularly Truvada and Atripla, to support our existing operations. Our HIV products contain tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and/or emtricitabine, which belong to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. Were the treatment paradigm for HIV to change, causing nucleoside-based therapeutics to fall out of favor, or if we were unable to continue increasing our HIV product sales, our results of operations would likely suffer and we would likely need to scale back our operations, including our spending on research and development (R&D) efforts. For the three months ended June 30, 2009, Truvada and Atripla product sales together were $1.18 billion, or 71% of our total revenues. We may not be able to sustain the growth rate of sales of our HIV products, especially Truvada and Atripla, for any number of reasons including, but not limited to, the following:        •    As our HIV products are used over a longer period of time in many patients and in combination with other products, and additional studies are conducted, new issues with respect to safety, resistance and interactions with other drugs may arise, which could cause us to provide additional warnings or contraindications on our labels, narrow our approved indications or halt sales of a product, each of which could reduce our revenues.        •    As our HIV products mature, private insurers and government reimbursers often reduce the amount they will reimburse patients for these products, which increases pressure on us to reduce prices.        •    A large part of the market for our HIV products consists of patients who are already taking other HIV drugs. If we are not successful in encouraging physicians to change patients’ regimens to include our HIV products, the sales of our HIV products will be limited.        •    As generic HIV products are introduced into major markets, our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected.    42    Table of Contents Our inability to accurately estimate demand for our products, as well as sales fluctuations as a result of inventory levels held by wholesalers, pharmacies and non-retail customers make it difficult for us to accurately forecast sales and may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our financial results and our stock price.  During the six months ended June 30, 2009, approximately 84% of our product sales in the United States were to three wholesalers, Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corp. and AmerisourceBergen Corp. The U.S. wholesalers with whom we have entered into inventory management agreements make estimates to determine end user demand and may not be completely effective in matching their inventory levels to actual end user demand. As a result, changes in inventory levels held by those wholesalers can cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to these wholesalers do not match end user demand. In addition, inventory is held at retail pharmacies and other non-wholesale locations with whom we have no inventory management agreements and no control over buying patterns. Adverse changes in economic conditions or other factors may cause retail pharmacies to reduce their inventories of our products, which would reduce their orders from wholesalers and, consequently, the wholesalers’ orders from us, even if end user demand has not changed. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2008, strong prescription demand for Truvada and Atripla was not fully reflected in our revenues for that quarter. We believe this is because inventories were drawn down within the retail distribution channel during the quarter. During the second quarter of 2009, the wholesalers increased their inventory levels for Atripla and Truvada, while inventory levels for Viread decreased. Given that demand from retail pharmacies was consistent with both prescription demand and revenue growth during the quarter, we expect that U.S. wholesalers may decrease their inventory levels in the second half of 2009. As inventory in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter, we may continue to see fluctuations in our earnings and a mismatch between prescription demand for our products and our revenues.  In addition, the non-retail sector in the United States, which includes government institutions, including state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP), correctional facilities and large health maintenance organizations, tends to be even less consistent in terms of buying patterns, and often causes quarter over quarter fluctuations that do not necessarily mirror the purchasing patterns that can be seen within the retail sector. For example, in the first quarter of 2008, we observed large non-retail purchases by a small number of state ADAPs that purchase centrally and have significant warehousing capacity. We believe such purchases were driven by the grant cycle for federal ADAP funds rather than current patient demand, which tempered orders and our associated product sales, revenues and earnings in the second quarter of 2008 as these organizations depleted their increased inventory levels established during the first quarter of 2008. We expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the purchasing patterns of our non-retail customers which may result in fluctuations in our product sales, revenues and earnings in the future.  We estimate the future demand for our products, consider the shelf life of our inventory and regularly review the realizability of our inventory. If actual demand is less than our estimated demand, we could be required to record inventory write-downs, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and our stock price.  If we fail to commercialize new products or expand the indications for existing products, our prospects for future revenues may be adversely affected.  If we do not introduce new products to market or increase sales of our existing products, we will not be able to increase or maintain our total revenues and continue to expand our R&D efforts. For example, the new drug application (NDA) submitted by us for aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in the United States was delayed when we received a complete response letter from the FDA informing us that the FDA will not approve the NDA in its current form and requesting we conduct an additional Phase 3 clinical study. In November 2008, we filed a request for dispute resolution with the FDA to determine whether further analyses of the existing data could lead to approval or whether we will need to conduct an additional study. In February 2009, in response to our appeal, the FDA notified us that it was reiterating its position that we will need     43    Table of Contents  to conduct another clinical study of aztreonam for inhalation solution before we can resubmit our NDA. We are conferring with the FDA to determine what further studies would be required to address their concerns and support approval of this product candidate. Existing data from any ongoing or additional clinical trial that we may commence to satisfy FDA concerns may not support the approval of aztreonam for inhalation solution in the United States, which may cause us considerable expense and may lead to further delays or cause us to abandon further development of the product. There are also risks that health authorities in other countries where marketing authorization applications are pending will undertake similar additional reviews which would compound the risks described above. As a result, aztreonam for inhalation solution may never be successfully commercialized. Further, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of such product candidate if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If this program and others in our pipeline cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted.  A significant portion of our product sales occur outside the United States, and currency fluctuations and hedging expenses may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price.  Because a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative value of such sales increases. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business.  We use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. We cannot predict future fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate of the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly against certain currencies and our hedging program does not sufficiently offset the effects of such appreciation, our results of operations will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.  Additionally, the expenses that we recognize in relation to our hedging activities can also cause our earnings to fluctuate. The level of hedging expenses that we recognize in a particular period is impacted by the changes in interest rate spreads between the foreign currencies that we hedge and the U.S. dollar.  We face significant competition.  We face significant competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, most of whom have substantially greater resources than we do. In addition, our competitors have more products and have operated in the fields in which we compete for longer than we have. Our HIV products compete primarily with products from GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK), which markets fixed dose combination products that compete with Truvada and Atripla. GSK and Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) recently announced that they are combining their HIV drug businesses into a single, jointly-owned company that will focus solely on competing in the HIV market. For Hepsera and Viread for treatment of chronic hepatitis B, we compete primarily with products produced by GSK, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Novartis) in the United States, the European Union and China. For AmBisome, we compete primarily with products produced by Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) and Pfizer. In addition, we are aware of at least two lipid formulations that claim similarity to AmBisome becoming available outside of the United States, including the possible entry of one such formulation in Greece. These formulations may reduce market demand for AmBisome. Furthermore, the manufacture of lipid formulations of amphotericin B is very complex and if any of these formulations are found to be unsafe, sales of AmBisome may be negatively impacted by association. Letairis competes directly with     44    Table of Contents  Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (Actelion) and indirectly with PAH products from United Therapeutics Corporation and Pfizer. Ranexa competes predominately with generic compounds from three distinct classes of drugs, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates for the treatment of chronic angina in the United States. Tamiflu competes with products sold by GSK and generic competitors. Aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of CF, if approved for marketing, will compete with a product marketed by Novartis.  In addition, a number of companies are pursuing the development of technologies which are competitive with our existing products or research programs. These competing companies include specialized pharmaceutical firms and large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently or together with other pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs.  If significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates, our future sales may be reduced, which would adversely affect our results of operations.  The data supporting the marketing approvals for our products and forming the basis for the safety warnings in our product labels were obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration and, in some cases, from post-approval use. As our products are used over longer periods of time by many patients with underlying health problems, taking numerous other medicines, we expect to continue to find new issues such as safety, resistance or drug interaction issues, which may require us to provide additional warnings or contraindications on our labels or narrow our approved indications, each of which could reduce the market acceptance of these products.  Our product Letairis, which was approved by the FDA in June 2007, is a member of a class of compounds called endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) which pose specific risks, including serious risks of liver injury and birth defects. Because of these risks, Letairis is available only through the Letairis Education and Access Program (LEAP), a restricted distribution program intended to help physicians and patients learn about the risks associated with the product and assure appropriate use of the product. As the product is used by additional patients, we may discover new risks associated with Letairis which may result in changes to the distribution program and additional restrictions on the use of Letairis which may decrease demand for the product. For example, since the launch of Letairis, cases of edema in certain patients taking Letairis have been reported. This information has recently been added to the product label, which may negatively impact demand for the product.  If serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues arise with our marketed products, including Letairis, sales of these products could be limited or halted by us or by regulatory authorities and our results of operations would be adversely affected.  Our operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products.  The products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We are continuing clinical trials for Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva, AmBisome, Letairis and Ranexa for currently approved and additional uses. We anticipate that we will file for marketing approval in additional countries and for additional indications and products over the next several years. These products may fail to receive such marketing approvals on a timely basis, or at all.  In September 2008, we received a complete response letter from the FDA informing us that the FDA will not approve our NDA for aztreonam for inhalation solution for treatment of CF in its current form and requesting we conduct an additional Phase 3 clinical study. In November 2008, we filed a request for dispute resolution with the FDA to determine whether further analyses of the existing data could lead to approval or whether we will     45    Table of Contents  need to conduct an additional study. In February 2009, in response to our appeal, the FDA notified us that it was reiterating its position that we will need to conduct another clinical study of aztreonam for inhalation solution before we can resubmit our NDA. We are conferring with the FDA to determine what further studies would be required to address their concerns and support approval of this product candidate. Existing data from any ongoing or from any additional clinical trial that we may commence to satisfy FDA concerns may not support the approval of aztreonam for inhalation solution in the United States, which may cause us considerable expense and may lead to further delays or cause us to abandon further development of the product. There are also risks that health authorities in other countries where marketing authorization applications are pending will undertake similar additional reviews which would compound the risks described above.  In addition, our marketed products and how we manufacture and sell these products are subject to extensive regulation and review. Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing or promotional activities may result in restrictions on our products, including withdrawal of the products from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we could be subject to penalties including fines, suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products and criminal prosecution.  On September 27, 2007, President Bush signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, which significantly expanded the FDA’s authority, including, among other things, to:        •    require sponsors of marketed products to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk;        •    mandate labeling changes to products, at any point in a product’s lifecycle, based on new safety information; and        •    require sponsors to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for a product which could include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to healthcare providers or other elements as the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the drug, which could include imposing certain restrictions on distribution or use of a product.  Failure to comply with these or other requirements, if imposed on a sponsor by the FDA, could result in significant civil monetary penalties.  The results and anticipated timelines of our clinical trials are uncertain and may not support continued development of a product pipeline, which would adversely affect our prospects for future revenue growth.  We are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of products that we develop for each intended use through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials. The results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. Even successfully completed large-scale clinical trials may not result in marketable products. If any of our product candidates fails to achieve its primary endpoint in clinical trials, if safety issues arise or if the results from our clinical trials are otherwise inadequate to support regulatory approval of our product candidates, commercialization of that product candidate could be delayed or halted. We may also face challenges in clinical trial protocol design. If the clinical trials for any of the product candidates in our pipeline are delayed or terminated, our prospects for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted. For example, we face numerous risks and uncertainties with our product candidates, including elvitegravir, our novel HIV integrase inhibitor; darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension; and ambrisentan for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), each currently in Phase 3 clinical trials that could prevent completion of development of these product candidates. These risks include our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials, the need to modify or delay our clinical trials or to perform additional trials and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. As a result, our product candidates may never be successfully commercialized. Further, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of our product candidates if, for example, we believe     46    Table of Contents  commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If these programs and others in our pipeline cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. In addition, clinical trials involving our commercial products could raise new safety issues for our existing products, which could in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business.  Due to our reliance on third party contract research organizations to conduct our clinical trials, we are unable to directly control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials.  We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. We rely on independent third party contract research organizations (CROs), to perform most of our clinical studies, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, program management and bioanalytical analysis. Many important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are out of our direct control. If there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our CROs, our clinical trials may be delayed. Moreover, in our regulatory submissions, we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third party CROs. If any of our CROs’ processes, methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or inadequate, our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals could be adversely impacted.  We depend on relationships with other companies for sales and marketing performance and revenues. Failure to maintain these relationships, poor performance by these companies or disputes with these companies could negatively impact our business.  We rely on a number of significant collaborative relationships with major pharmaceutical companies for our sales and marketing performance in certain territories. These include collaborations with BMS for Atripla in the United States, Europe and Canada; Roche for Tamiflu; and GSK for ambrisentan in territories outside of the United States. In some countries, we rely on international distributors for sales of Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva and AmBisome. Some of these relationships also involve the clinical development of these products by our partners. Reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including the risk that:        •    we are unable to control the resources our corporate partners devote to our programs or products;        •    disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of rights to technology developed with our corporate partners;        •    disagreements with our corporate partners could cause delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of product candidates or result in litigation or arbitration;        •    contracts with our corporate partners may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if one of these partners fails to perform;        •    our corporate partners have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional products and may pursue alternative technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors;        •    our corporate partners with marketing rights may choose to pursue competing technologies or to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our products than they do to products of their own development; and        •    our distributors and our corporate partners may be unable to pay us, particularly in light of current economic conditions.  Given these risks, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed or revenues from products could decline.    47    Table of Contents Under our April 2002 licensing agreement with GSK, we gave GSK the right to control clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of Hepsera in territories in Asia, Africa and Latin America. These include major markets for Hepsera, such as China, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. The success of Hepsera in these territories depends almost entirely on the efforts of GSK. In this regard, GSK promotes Epivir-HBV/Zeffix, a product that competes with Hepsera. Consequently, GSK’s marketing strategy for Hepsera may be influenced by its promotion of Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. We receive royalties from GSK equal to a percentage of GSK’s net sales of Hepsera as well as net sales of GSK’s Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. If GSK fails to devote sufficient resources to, or does not succeed in developing or commercializing Hepsera in its territories, our potential revenues from sales of Hepsera related to these territories may be substantially reduced.  In addition, Letairis is distributed through third party specialty pharmacies, which are pharmacies specializing in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions that may require a high level of patient education and ongoing counseling. The use of specialty pharmacies requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing, medical affairs, regulatory affairs, legal and finance organizations and involves risks, including but not limited to risks that these specialty pharmacies will:        •    not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, patient data or safety complaints;        •    not effectively sell or support Letairis;        •    not devote the resources necessary to sell Letairis in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;        •    not be able to satisfy their financial obligations to us or others; or        •    cease operations.  We also rely on a third party to administer LEAP, the restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis. This third party provides information and education to prescribers and patients on the risks of Letairis, confirms insurance coverage and investigates alternative sources of reimbursement or assistance, ensures fulfillment of the risk management requirements mandated for Letairis by the FDA and coordinates and controls dispensing to patients through the third party specialty pharmacies. Failure of this third party or the specialty pharmacies that distribute Letairis to perform as expected may result in regulatory action from the FDA or decreased Letairis sales, either of which would harm our business.  Further, we will be dependent on the supplier of the inhalation device that delivers aztreonam for inhalation solution, if and when regulatory approval is obtained, to distribute the device through specialty pharmacies or other distribution channels, and we will not have control over many key aspects related to the device. For example, the supplier could encounter issues with regulatory agencies related to the device or be unable to supply sufficient quantities of this device at the time of a commercial launch or following a commercial launch. Moreover, because this device will be subject to a separate reimbursement approval process, in the event our supplier is unable to obtain reimbursement approval or receives approval at a lower-than-expected price, sales of aztreonam for inhalation solution may be adversely affected. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate supplies of inhalation devices from our supplier. Any of the previously described issues may limit or further delay the commercial launch of aztreonam for inhalation solution, which would adversely affect our financial results.  Our existing products are subject to reimbursement from government agencies and other third parties. Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressures may reduce profitability.  Successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of governmental and third party payor reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement. In     48    Table of Contents  the United States, the European Union and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and third party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. For example, a significant portion of our sales of the majority of our products are subject to significant discounts from list price and rebate obligations. In addition, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our product revenues and profitability. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and health care reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.  In Europe, the success of our commercialized products, and any other product candidates we may develop, will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because in many European countries patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In addition, negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization by 12 months or more. Reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. In many international markets, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals, including through the implementation of reference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes and profit control, and expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as volumes increase. In recent years, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on our products, and we expect this to continue as countries attempt to manage health care expenditures, especially in light of the global economic downturn. As new drugs come to market, we may face significant price decreases for our products across most of the European countries. We believe that this will continue into the foreseeable future as governments struggle with escalating health care spending. As a result of these pricing practices, it may become difficult to maintain our historic levels of profitability or to achieve expected rates of growth.  Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future health care reforms.  Legislative and regulatory changes to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. There have been significant changes to the federal Medicare system in recent years in the United States that could impact the pricing of our products. Under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, Medicare beneficiaries are able to elect coverage for prescription drugs under Medicare Part D. The prescription drug program began on January 1, 2006 and although we have benefited from patients transitioning from Medicaid to Medicare Part D since 2006, the longer term impact of Medicare Part D on our business is not yet clear to us, and the impact will depend in part on specific decisions regarding the level of coverage provided for the therapeutic categories in which our products are included, the terms on which such coverage is provided, and the extent to which preference is given to selected products in a category. Third party payors providing Medicare Part D coverage have attempted to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, discussions are taking place at the federal level to pass legislation that would either allow or require the federal government to directly negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers or set minimum requirements for Medicare pricing. The increasing pressure to lower prescription drug prices may limit drug access for Medicare Part D enrollees. Further, Medicare patients have to pay co-insurance, which may influence which products are recommended by physicians and selected by patients. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the reimbursement changes emerging from Medicare prescription drug coverage legislation. In addition to federal Medicare proposals, state Medicaid drug payment changes could also lower payment for our products. To the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow Medicaid coverage and payment developments, the adverse effects may be magnified by private insurers adopting lower payment schedules. Additionally, any additional statutory or regulatory changes, including potential changes to Medicare Part D, and health care reform at both the federal and state levels could adversely affect payment for our drugs and demand for our product. At this time, a few states have already enacted health care reform legislation, and the federal government and individual state governments continue to consider health care reform     49    Table of Contents  policies and legislation. The pricing and reimbursement environment for our products may change in the future and become more challenging due to, among other reasons, new policies of the new presidential administration or new health care legislation passed by Congress.  The Ryan White Program, the largest federal program designed to provide care and support services for people living with HIV in the United States, provides funding for our HIV products through state ADAPs to many patients who are uninsured or underinsured. Federal funding is appropriated by Congress each year and is provided to cities, states, providers and other organizations. In addition to federal funding, some states and localities provide additional funding for Ryan White Program services. The program is up for reauthorization again by September 2009 unless otherwise extended by Congress, and there may be changes to the program which would change or decrease the funding available for our HIV products. For example, if appropriations for the Ryan White Program are held at the same amount as in previous years and more people access our HIV drugs through ADAP, then it is likely that we will face pressures to provide even greater discounts for drugs purchased through the program. In addition, falling state revenues and budget cuts may result in reduction of state or local funding for the Ryan White Program, which could lead to increased demand on our patient assistance programs, under which we offer our HIV products free of charge to eligible patients.  Expenses associated with clinical trials may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price.  The clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our products, as well as clinical trials we are required to conduct after approval, are very expensive. It is difficult to accurately predict or control the amount or timing of these expenses from quarter to quarter, and the FDA may require more clinical testing that we originally anticipated. For example, the FDA has recently reiterated its position that we will need to conduct another Phase 3 clinical study of aztreonam for inhalation solution before we can resubmit our NDA. Uneven and unexpected spending on these programs may cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and our stock price may decline.  Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to protect our patents and other intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally. We may not be able to obtain effective patents to protect our technologies from use by competitors and patents of other companies could require us to stop using or pay for the use of required technology.  Patents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to:        •    obtain patents and licenses to patent rights;        •    preserve trade secrets; and        •    operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others.  If we have a properly designed and enforceable patent, it can be more difficult for our competitors to use our technology to create competitive products and more difficult for our competitors to obtain a patent that prevents us from using technology we create. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection both in the United States and internationally and file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements in our compounds, products and technology.  We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications and rights to patents related to our compounds, products and technology, but we cannot be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents. Patent applications are confidential for a period of time until a patent is issued. As a result, we may not know if our competitors filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent the     50    Table of Contents  technology that is the subject of our patent applications. Competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our patents. In addition, if competitors file patent applications covering our technology, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or litigation to determine the right to a patent. Litigation and interference proceedings are expensive, such that, even if we are ultimately successful, our results of operations may be adversely affected by such events.  From time to time, certain individuals or entities may challenge our patents. For example, in 2007, the Public Patent Foundation filed requests for re-examination with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) challenging four of our patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which is an active ingredient in Truvada, Atripla and Viread. The PTO granted these requests and issued non-final rejections for the four patents, which is a step common in a proceeding to initiate the re-examination process. In 2008, the PTO confirmed the patentability of all four patents.  Although we were successful in responding to the PTO office actions in the instance above, similar organizations may still challenge our patents in foreign jurisdictions. For example, in April 2008, the Brazilian Health Ministry, citing the U.S. patent re-examination proceedings as grounds for rejection, requested that the Brazilian patent authority issue a decision that is not supportive of our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in Brazil. In August 2008, an examiner in the Brazilian patent authority issued a final rejection of our fumarate salt patent application, the only patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate we have filed in Brazil. We then filed an appeal within the patent authority responding to the questions raised in the rejection. In July 2009, the Brazilian patent authority again rejected the application. This was the highest level of appeal available to us within the Brazilian patent authority. We intend to file a civil action in Brazilian federal court to further appeal the action of the Brazilian patent authority. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding on our tenofovir disoproxil fumarate patent application. If we are unable to successfully appeal the decision by the patent authority in the courts, the Brazilian government would likely purchase generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which would significantly reduce our sales of HIV products in Brazil.  Patents do not cover the active ingredients in AmBisome. In addition, we do not have patent filings in China or certain other Asian countries covering all forms of adefovir dipivoxil, the active ingredient in Hepsera. Asia is a major market for therapies for hepatitis B infection, the indication for which Hepsera has been developed.  We may obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained for those products. Because patents have a limited life, which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of the patent may be limited. However, we may be able to apply for patent term extensions.  As part of the approval process of some of our products, the FDA granted an exclusivity period during which other manufacturers’ applications for approval of generic versions of our product will not be granted. Generic manufacturers often wait to challenge the patents protecting products that have been granted exclusivity until one year prior to the end of the exclusivity period. From time to time, we have received notices from manufacturers indicating that they intend to import chemical intermediates possibly for use in making our products. It is, therefore, possible that generic manufacturers are considering attempts to seek FDA approval for a similar or identical drug through an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), which is the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. If our patents are subject to challenges, we may need to spend significant resources to defend such challenges and we may not be able to defend our patents successfully. For example, in November 2008, we received notice that Teva Pharmaceuticals (Teva) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Truvada. In the notice, Teva alleges that two of the patents associated with emtricitabine, owned by Emory University and licensed exclusively to us, are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva’s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In December 2008, we filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents. In March 2009, we received notice that Teva     51    Table of Contents  Pharmaceuticals submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Atripla. In the notice, Teva alleges that the same two emtricitabine patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva’s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Atripla. In May 2009, we filed another lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of either of these actions and we may spend significant resources defending these patents. If we are unsuccessful in one or both of these lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for Truvada and Atripla in the United States would be shortened to expire in 2017 instead of 2021.  In August 2007, the PTO adopted new rules which were scheduled to become effective on November 1, 2007. In October 2007, GSK successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against implementation of these rules, and in April 2008, the court ruled in support of GSK’s challenge to the rules and obtained a permanent injunction against their implementation. The rules would have restricted the number of claims permitted in a patent application and the number of continuing patent applications that can be filed. Following the court’s ruling, the PTO filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2009, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed one of the rules, vacated one of the rules, and remanded the case to the district court. The rule restricting the number of claims permitted in a patent application was held to be a legitimate exercise of the PTO’s authority. The rule restricting the number of continuing patent applications that can be filed was held to be beyond the authority of the PTO. Upon GSK’s petition for reconsideration, the Federal Circuit voted to reconsider the decision in an en banc proceeding, which is now pending. If GSK is ultimately unsuccessful in challenging the implementation of the rules and the rules are implemented, we may be limited in our ability to obtain broad patent coverage for our products and product candidates, which may allow competitors to market products very similar to ours or to obtain patent coverage for closely related products.   Our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.  If we infringe the patents of others, we may be prevented from commercializing products or may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties. We may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain these licenses or alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products. For example, we are aware of a body of patents that may relate to our operation of LEAP, our restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis. In addition, Actelion, which markets Tracleer, has applied for a patent that claims a method of use for ERAs for the treatment of IPF. If issued, this patent may interfere with our efforts to commercialize our own ERA, ambrisentan, for the treatment of IPF.  Furthermore, we use significant proprietary technology and rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect certain aspects of our production and other technologies. Our trade secrets may become known or independently discovered by our competitors.  We may not be able to successfully integrate our existing business with the business of CV Therapeutics, Inc., or any other business or assets that we may acquire.  Integrating the business of CV Therapeutics, Inc. (CV Therapeutics) with our existing business will be a complex and time-consuming process. Until recently, CV Therapeutics operated independently of us, with its own business, corporate culture, locations, employees and systems. As a result of this acquisition, we will have to operate our existing business, along with the business of CV Therapeutics, utilizing common information and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls and human resources practices, including benefits, training and professional development programs. There may be substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in the integration of our business with CV Therapeutics and the integration of our business with any other company or assets that we may from time to time acquire. The failure to successfully integrate our business with CV Therapeutics, or any other assets or companies we may acquire, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.    52    Table of Contents Manufacturing problems could delay product shipments and regulatory approvals, which may adversely affect our results of operations.  We depend on third parties to perform manufacturing activities effectively and on a timely basis for the majority of our solid dose products. In addition, Roche, either by itself or through third parties, is responsible for manufacturing Tamiflu. The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. We, our third party manufacturers and our corporate partners are subject to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards. Similar regulations are in effect in other countries. Our manufacturing operations are also subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies. Additionally, these third party manufacturers and corporate partners are independent entities who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks which are out of our control. If we or any of these third party manufacturers or corporate partners fail to perform as required, this could impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis or receive royalties or cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. To the extent these risks materialize and affect their performance obligations to us, our financial results may be adversely affected.  Our ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize aztreonam for inhalation solution, if approved, will depend upon our ability to manufacture in a multi-product facility.  Aztreonam is a mono-bactam Gram-negative antibiotic that we currently plan to manufacture, by ourselves or through third parties, in multi-product manufacturing facilities. Historically, the FDA has permitted the manufacture of mono-bactams in multi-product manufacturing facilities; however, there can be no assurance that the FDA will continue to allow this practice. We do not currently have a single-product facility that can be dedicated to the manufacture of aztreonam for inhalation solution nor have we engaged a contract manufacturer with a single-product facility for aztreonam for inhalation solution. If the FDA prohibits the manufacture of mono-bactam antibiotics, like aztreonam for inhalation solution, in multi-product manufacturing facilities in the future, we may not be able to procure a single-product manufacturing facility in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our commercial supplies of aztreonam for inhalation solution and our anticipated financial results attributable to such product, if approved.  We may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, which would limit our ability to generate revenues.  We need access to certain supplies and products to conduct our clinical trials and to manufacture our products. In light of the economic downturn, we have had increased difficulty in purchasing certain of the raw materials used in our manufacturing process. If we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of these materials or find suitable alternate materials in a timely manner, our development efforts for our product candidates may be delayed or our ability to manufacture our products would be limited, which would limit our ability to generate revenues.  Suppliers of key components and materials must be named in an NDA filed with the FDA for any product candidate for which we are seeking FDA approval, and significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required. Even after a manufacturer is qualified by the FDA, the manufacturer must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with GMP. Manufacturers are subject to regular, periodic inspections by the FDA following initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may suspend the manufacturing operations. If the manufacturing operations of any of the single suppliers for our products are suspended, we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of product to meet market demand, which would in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business.    53    Table of Contents In addition, if delivery of material from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason, we may be unable to ship certain of our products for commercial supply or to supply our products in development for clinical trials. In addition, some of our products and the materials that we utilize in our operations are made at only one facility. For example, we manufacture AmBisome and fill and finish Macugen exclusively at our facilities in San Dimas, California. In the event of a natural disaster, including an earthquake, equipment failure or other difficulty, we may be unable to replace this manufacturing capacity in a timely manner and may be unable to manufacture AmBisome and Macugen to meet market needs.  Our product candidate, aztreonam for inhalation solution, which is pending FDA approval, is dependent on four different single-source suppliers. First, aztreonam, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in aztreonam for inhalation solution, is manufactured by a single supplier at a single site. Second, it is administered to the lungs of patients through a device that is made by a single supplier at a single site. Third, the FDA recently approved our facilities in San Dimas to manufacture aztreonam for inhalation solution, subject to FDA approval of the product and delivery device. The San Dimas facility is the only manufacturing site authorized to manufacture aztreonam for inhalation solution, although we are pursuing FDA approval of a third party supplier. Fourth, the diluent for aztreonam for inhalation solution will be manufactured by a single manufacturer at a single site.  In addition, we depend on a single supplier for high quality cholesterol, which is used in the manufacture of AmBisome. We also depend on single suppliers for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Letairis and Ranexa and for the tableting of Letairis. Astellas Pharma US, Inc., which markets Lexiscan in the United States, is responsible for the commercial manufacture and supply of product in United States and is dependent on a single supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Lexiscan. Problems with any of the single suppliers we depend on may negatively impact our development and commercialization efforts.  We face credit risks from our European customers that may adversely affect our results of operations.  Our European product sales to government-owned or supported customers in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. This has resulted and may continue to result in an increase in days sales outstanding due to the average length of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding. Our accounts receivable in these countries totaled approximately $638.7 million as of June 30, 2009, of which $196.2 million was more than 120 days past due. Historically, receivables balances with certain government owned hospitals accumulated over a period of time and were then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments. If significant changes were to occur in the reimbursement practices of these European governments or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from these customers and our results of operations would be adversely affected.  Our product revenues and gross margin could be reduced by imports from countries where our products are available at lower prices.  Prices for our products are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country. Our sales in countries with relatively higher prices may be reduced if products can be imported into those or other countries from lower price markets. There have been cases in which other pharmaceutical products were sold at steeply discounted prices in the developing world and then re-exported to European countries where they could be re-sold at much higher prices. If this happens with our products, particularly Truvada and Viread, which we have agreed to make available at substantially reduced prices to more than 125 countries participating in our Gilead Access Program, or Atripla, which Merck distributes at substantially reduced prices to HIV infected patients in developing countries under our August 2006 agreement, our revenues would be adversely affected. In addition, we have established partnerships with ten Indian generic manufacturers to distribute high-quality, low-cost generic versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to 95 developing world countries, including India. If generic versions of our medications under these licenses are then re-exported to the United States, Europe or other markets outside of these 95 countries, our revenues would be adversely affected.    54    Table of Contents In addition, purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively high may adversely impact our revenues and gross margin and may cause our sales to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For example, in the European Union, we are required to permit products purchased in one country to be sold in another country. Purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively high affect the inventory level held by our wholesalers and can cause the relative sales levels in the various countries to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and be more difficult to forecast. In addition, wholesalers may attempt to arbitrage the pricing differential between countries by purchasing excessive quantities of our products. These activities may result in fluctuating quarterly sales in certain countries which do not reflect the actual demand for our products from customers. Such quarterly fluctuations may impact our earnings, which could adversely affect our stock price. For example, during 2007, we experienced increased sales of our HIV products in France. We believe a portion of these products was being re-exported to other countries and resold at higher prices. Our sales of Truvada, Atripla and Viread in France and any countries to or from which sales have been re-exported may continue to fluctuate. Although we established an order management system in France to manage Truvada, Atripla and Viread sales to facilitate the adequate and appropriate supply of those products commensurate with market demand in France, there can be no assurance that this management system will be effective or that these re-exporting activities will not continue in France, other European countries or elsewhere, and as a result, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  In some countries, we may be required to grant compulsory licenses for our products or face generic competition for our products.  In a number of developing countries, government officials and other interested groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs for HIV infection available at low cost. Alternatively, governments in those developing countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products, thereby reducing our product sales. For example, in the past, certain offices of the government of Brazil have expressed concern over the affordability of our HIV products and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory licenses to permit the manufacture of otherwise patented products for HIV infection, including Viread. In July 2009, the Brazilian patent authority rejected our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viread. We intend to file a civil action in Brazilian federal court to further appeal the action of the Brazilian patent authority. If we are unable to successfully appeal the decision by the patent authority in the courts, the Brazilian government would likely purchase generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which would significantly reduce our sales of HIV products in Brazil. In addition, concerns over the cost and availability of Tamiflu related to a potential avian flu pandemic have generated international discussions over compulsory licensing of our Tamiflu patents. For example, the Canadian government may allow Canadian manufacturers to manufacture and export the active ingredient in Tamiflu to eligible developing and least developed countries under Canada’s Access to Medicines Regime. Furthermore, Roche has issued voluntary licenses to permit third party manufacturing of Tamiflu. For example, Roche has granted a sublicense to Shanghai Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. for China and a sublicense to India’s Hetero Drugs Limited for India and certain developing countries. Should one or more compulsory licenses be issued permitting generic manufacturing to override our Tamiflu patents, or should Roche issue additional voluntary licenses to permit third party manufacturing of Tamiflu, those developments could reduce royalties we receive from Roche’s sales of Tamiflu. Certain countries do not permit enforcement of our patents, and third party manufacturers are able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries. Compulsory licenses or sales of generic versions of our products could significantly reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if generic versions of our products are imported into territories where we have existing commercial sales.    55    Table of Contents We may face significant liability resulting from our products that may not be covered by insurance and successful claims could materially reduce our earnings.  The testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our commercial products, as well as product candidates in development, involve substantial risk of product liability claims. These claims may be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others. In recent years, coverage and availability of product liability insurance has decreased. In addition, the cost to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims may exceed our coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate coverage or if claims exceed our coverage, our financial condition and our ability to clinically test our product candidates and to market our products will be adversely impacted. In addition, negative publicity associated with any claims, regardless of their merit, may decrease the future demand for our products and impair our financial condition.  Our assumptions used to determine our self-insurance levels could be wrong and materially impact our business.   We continually evaluate our levels of self-insurance based on historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. However, if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially impacted by claims and other expenses.  Expensive litigation and government investigations may reduce our earnings.  In November 2008, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Truvada. In the notice, Teva alleges that two of the patents associated with emtricitabine, owned by Emory University and licensed exclusively to us, are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva’s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In December 2008, we filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents. In March 2009, we received notice that Teva Pharmaceuticals submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Atripla. In the notice, Teva alleges that the same two emtricitabine patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva’s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Atripla. In May 2009, we filed another lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of either of these actions, and we may spend significant resources defending these patents. If we are unsuccessful in one or both of these lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated, and the patent protection for Truvada and Atripla in the United States would be shortened to expire in 2017 instead of 2021.  In addition, we, along with certain of our officers and a former officer, were named as defendants in a class action lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws. The lawsuit was dismissed by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, but in August 2008 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the dismissal and remanded the case to the district court. In February 2009, we filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States, requesting that the Supreme Court review the judgment of the court of appeals. In April 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court denied our petition. The case continues before the district court. In February 2009, we filed a further motion to dismiss the fourth consolidated amended complaint on alternative grounds. On June 3, 2009, the district court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss and gave plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint. On July 10, 2009, plaintiffs filed a fifth consolidated amended complaint. Our deadline to respond to the fifth consolidated amended complaint is August 12, 2009. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this action, and we may spend significant resources defending this lawsuit.    56    Table of Contents Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.  Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, mergers and acquisitions, future levels of R&D spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings and finalization of federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income. For example, California recently passed legislation which may potentially reduce our California income tax commencing in 2011. In response to the legislation, we have evaluated certain tax planning strategies. If the tax planning strategies are not implemented, we may need to revalue certain of our tax assets. Any required revaluation may impact our income tax provision which could have a negative impact on our earnings.  Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.  Changes in accounting rules or policies may affect our financial position and results of operations.  U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and related implementation guidelines and interpretations can be highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation, the adoption of new pronouncements or the application of existing pronouncements to changes in our business could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations.  If we fail to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop new product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates.  Our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, governmental regulation and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense, and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms. If we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts, our business may be harmed.    57    Table of Contents   ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
