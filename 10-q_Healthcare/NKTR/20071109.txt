Item 1A. Risk Factors  Investors in Nektar Therapeutics should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. The risks described below may not be the only ones relating to our company. This description includes any material changes to and supersedes the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2007. Additional risks that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, results of operation, financial condition, cash flow and future prospects and the trading price of our common stock and our abilities to repay our convertible notes could be harmed as a result of any of these risks, and investors may lose all or part of their investment. In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, and our other filings from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  Risks Related to Our Business  The termination of the Pfizer Agreements will significantly reduce our future revenue.  On October 18, 2007, Pfizer delivered a notice of termination of our Collaborative Development and License Agreement and certain related agreements as part of its public announcement that Pfizer would exit the Exubera product area and our collaboration to develop a next-generation inhaled insulin product. Since the inception of the Company, we have historically depended on revenue from Pfizer related to Exubera. Our total revenue from the Pfizer agreements for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2007, was 63% and 69%, respectively, of our total revenue for such periods. As a result of the termination of the Pfizer agreements, we anticipate that we will not continue to receive significant future revenue from the commercial manufacture and sale of Exubera inhalers and inhalation powder to Pfizer. Accordingly, our revenue will decline significantly in the first half of 2008 with no revenue from Pfizer expected at all in the second half of 2008. We cannot currently estimate the timing or amounts of any revenue to be received from Pfizer in 2008 which will depend on such uncertainties as interpretations of post-termination contractual commitments and certain mitigation obligations.    27    Table of Contents Any future value from Exubera and our next-generation inhaled insulin development program depends on successfully securing a new collaboration partnership.  Pfizer had sole responsibility for the distribution, sales, and marketing of Exubera and Pfizer was also responsible for manufacturing and delivering bulk insulin for powder processing, filling the insulin powder into blister packs for the Exubera inhaler and providing the packaging for the final Exubera product. We do not have a sales and marketing organization or distribution operation, nor can we manufacture the final Exubera product as currently packaged on our own. To generate ongoing revenue from Exubera, we need to complete a collaboration partnership with another pharmaceutical company who can continue the role played by Pfizer. We may not be able to secure such a partner. Even if we are able to enter into a collaboration agreement with a suitable commercialization partner, we anticipate any commercialization partner would require substantial time and incur substantial costs to commercialize Exubera successfully and a certain level of cooperation by Pfizer would likely be required and Pfizer has no obligation to do so under our agreements. In addition, a new commercialization partner would be required to obtain or secure the transfer of regulatory approval from the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities prior to marketing Exubera. Although the regulatory approval process could be shorter if Pfizer assisted us in obtaining transfer of regulatory approvals, such assistance is not required under the termination provisions of our agreements with Pfizer. Any failure, delay or inability to address manufacturing, packaging or regulatory challenges could impede commercialization of Exubera with a new partner when or if a new collaboration is completed.  In addition to our collaboration with Pfizer on Exubera, we had been collaborating with Pfizer on the development of a next-generation inhaled insulin device with the goal to maintain a long-term competitive advantage in the inhaled insulin market. The objective of these development efforts has been to improve the device portability, convenience, reliability and ease of use. There are significant development and marketing risks associated with this program, including developing the insulin formulation for the next-generation inhaler device, design engineering challenges, design for manufacturability and cost effectiveness and clinical development and regulatory considerations. With the termination of our Pfizer collaboration, further clinical development will be delayed until we find a development and commercialization partner for this program. Our ability to successfully complete a partnership will also likely depend on a potential partner’s interest in Exubera. Even if we do find a partner, any delay could result in lost potential market share. The next-generation inhaled insulin product candidate will require regulatory approval which could be a very costly and time consuming process and which might not be obtained. Competitors with products under development could develop, obtain regulatory approval, and commercialize a more convenient, easier to use, smaller pulmonary insulin inhaler device for insulin or be quicker to market with a new inhaler device. Either event could reduce future market share for Exubera or our next generation inhaled insulin program. The inhaled insulin market competes against other, more well known and established methods of delivering insulin such as injection. While we believe inhaled insulin has significant delivery advantages over such methods, the market remains small and we will not be able to establish a large market unless diabetics and their doctors perceive a need to switch from traditional methods of delivery to inhaled insulin.  The termination of the Pfizer Agreements could result in significant expenses and charges.  As a result of the termination of the Pfizer agreements, if we are not successful in finding a new collaboration partner in the near-term, we will incur significant cash and non-cash expenses and charges related to manufacturing capacity wind-down expenses, facility closures, severance and other costs relating to reduction in personnel, supplier contract liabilities and potential termination of our contract with two contract manufacturers for the Exubera inhalers that will require us to reimburse those manufacturers for un-recaptured prior capital expenditures, severance costs and other wind-down costs. These expenses and charges may be significant and may result in cash expenditures by us for our own restructuring activities and other third party liabilities. We are assessing the timing and amount of any such charges and the recoverability of such expenses from Pfizer, and we may not be able to recover the amount of our liabilities to the contract manufacturers.  Our revenue historically depends on revenue from collaboration agreements and therefore fluctuates significantly from quarter to quarter.  Historically, our revenue is principally derived from collaboration agreements with third parties. Such revenue includes milestone payments and a portion of our research and development expenses that was charged to our partners pursuant to collaborative arrangements with them. The amount of our revenue derived from collaboration agreements in any given period will depend on a number of unpredictable factors, including our ability to find suitable partners, the timing of the negotiation and conclusion of agreements with such partners, whether and when we achieve milestones agreed upon with our partners, whether the partnership is exclusive or whether we can seek other partners, the timing of regulatory approvals and the market introduction of new products, and other factors. As a result, our revenue tends to fluctuate materially on a quarterly basis. We believe that our revenue will continue to fluctuate as a result of the factors described above.    28    Table of Contents We expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.  In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, we reported net losses of $71.8 million If and when we achieve profitability depends upon a number of factors, including the timing and recognition of milestone payments and license fees received, the timing of revenue under collaboration agreements, the amount of investments we make in our proprietary product candidates, and the regulatory approval and market success of our product candidates. We may not be able to achieve and sustain profitability.  Other factors that will affect whether we achieve and sustain profitability include our ability, alone or together with our partners, to:        •    develop products utilizing our technologies, either independently or in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies;        •    receive necessary regulatory and marketing approvals;        •    maintain or expand manufacturing at necessary levels;        •    achieve market acceptance for our products;        •    receive royalties on products that have been approved, marketed or submitted for marketing approval with regulatory authorities in line with our current forecasts; and        •    maintain sufficient funds to finance our activities.  If we do not generate sufficient cash flow through increased revenue or raising additional capital, then we may not be able to meet our substantial debt obligations.  As of September 30, 2007, we had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and investments in marketable securities valued at approximately $452.6 million and approximately $413.2 million of indebtedness, including approximately $381.6 million in convertible subordinated notes, $23.1 million in capital lease obligations, and $8.5 million of other long-term liabilities. We expect to use a substantial portion of our cash to fund our ongoing operations over the next few years. In addition, we repaid $66.6 million of convertible subordinated notes due in October 2007. The remaining $315.0 million of convertible subordinated notes will mature in 2012.  Our substantial indebtedness has and will continue to impact us by:        •    making it more difficult to obtain additional financing;        •    constraining our ability to react quickly in an unfavorable economic climate;        •    constraining our stock price; and        •    constraining our ability to invest in our proprietary product development programs.  Currently we are not generating positive cash flow. The termination of the Pfizer Agreements may further reduce our ability to meet our debt obligations. In addition, since the market price of our common stock is significantly below the related conversion price, the holders of the related outstanding convertible subordinated notes will not likely convert such securities to equity in accordance with their existing terms. If we are unable to satisfy our debt service requirements, substantial liquidity problems could result.  In the future, we may not generate sufficient cash from operations to repay our remaining convertible subordinated notes or satisfy any other of these obligations when they become due and may have to raise additional funds from the sale of equity or debt securities or otherwise restructure our obligations in order to do so. Any such financing or restructuring may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.  If we cannot raise additional capital, our financial condition will suffer.  We have no material credit facility or other material committed sources of capital. To the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital needs, we will have to raise additional funds from partners or the capital markets to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies and proprietary products. Such funds may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. We may be unable to obtain suitable partners on attractive terms and our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain additional capital markets financing. If adequate funds are not available on reasonable terms, we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into     29    Table of Contents  financing, supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms. Our inability to raise capital could harm our business and our stock price. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities would result in dilution to our stockholders.  Our future depends on the proper management of our current and future business operations and their associated expenses.  Our business strategy requires us to manage our business to provide for the continued development and potential commercialization of our proprietary product candidates. Our strategy also calls for us to undertake increased research and development activities, and to manage an increasing number of relationships with collaborators and other third parties, while simultaneously managing the expenses generated by these activities. As a result of the Pfizer termination, we will be required either to find a new partner to take on the commercialization of Exubera and development of next-generation inhaled insulin, or we will need to restructure our business to eliminate the costs and infrastructure associated with these programs in order to direct our resources towards other proprietary product development programs and partnered products. If we are unable to manage effectively our current operations and any growth we may experience, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If we are unable to effectively manage our expenses, we may find it necessary to reduce our personnel-related costs through further reductions in our workforce, which could harm our operations, employee morale, and could impair our ability to retain and recruit talent. Furthermore, if adequate funds are not available, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or other sources that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products that we would not otherwise relinquish.  Because our proprietary product candidates are in the early stages of development, there is a high risk of failure, and we may never succeed in developing marketable products or generating revenue from our proprietary product candidates.  Our efforts to apply our Pulmonary Technology and PEGylation Technology to our proprietary product development programs may fail. None of our product candidates have received regulatory approval and our development efforts may never result in another commercialized product. Development of our proprietary products will require extensive additional time, effort and cost in preclinical testing and clinical trials. Our proprietary product candidates also require lengthy regulatory reviews before they can be marketed by us or our partners. Drug development is an uncertain process that involves trial and error, and we may fail at numerous stages along the way. In addition, it can also be very difficult to estimate the commercial potential of early stage product candidates due to such factors such as safety and efficacy when compared to other available treatments, changing standards of care, patient and physician preferences and the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the long development process or after commercial introduction.  Our investment in the development and commercialization of our proprietary product candidates prior to seeking partnering arrangements may be unsuccessful and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.  Our strategy is to fund our proprietary product development programs, including some or all of the clinical trials, prior to partnering with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. While we believe this strategy may result in improved economics for our proprietary product candidates, it will require significant investment by us without reimbursement. As a result, we bear an increased economic risk in the event one or more of our proprietary product candidates is not successful. Even if the product development is ultimately successful, our increased investment could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition prior to commercialization.  If we fail to establish future successful collaborative relationships, then our results of operation and financial condition will be adversely impacted.  In addition to our new efforts to find a partner for Exubera and the next-generation inhaled insulin development program, we intend to seek future collaborative relationships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to fund some of our research and development expenses and develop and commercialize product candidates. In 2007, we accomplished our goal of completing a partnership based on our Pulmonary Technology with the execution of the Bayer partnership for NKTR-061 on August 1, 2007. In addition, we are also working to achieve a successful partnership based on our PEGylation Technology. The success, timing and terms and conditions of these partnering efforts will affect our revenue and financial results in 2007 and beyond. If we are ultimately not able to negotiate acceptable collaborative arrangements with respect to our existing and future product candidates, or if any arrangements we do negotiate do not include sufficiently favorable commercial terms, we may not receive an adequate return on these investments and our results of operations and financial condition would suffer.    30    Table of Contents We depend on collaborative partners to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our partner products, and if they are not successful, or if such collaborations fail, then the product development or commercialization of our partner products may be delayed or unsuccessful.  When we sign a collaborative development agreement or license agreement to develop a product candidate with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, the pharmaceutical or biotechnology company is generally expected to:        •    synthesize active pharmaceutical ingredients to be used in the product candidate;        •    design and conduct large scale clinical studies;        •    prepare and file documents necessary to obtain government approvals to sell a given product candidate; or        •    market and sell our products when and if they are approved.  Reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including:        •    we may be unable to control whether and the extent to which our collaborative partners will devote sufficient resources to the development programs or commercial efforts;        •    disputes may arise in the future with respect to the ownership of rights to technology or intellectual property developed with collaborative partners;        •    disagreements with collaborative partners could lead to delays in or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, or result in litigation or arbitration;        •    contracts with our collaborative partners may fail to provide significant protection or be effectively enforced if one of these partners fails to perform. Collaborative partners have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional product candidates and may pursue alternative technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors;        •    collaborative partners with marketing rights may choose to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our products than they do to products of their own development;        •    the timing and level of resources that our collaborative partners’ dedicate to the development program will affect the timing and amount of revenue we receive;        •    our collaborative partners may be unable to pay us as expected; and        •    collaborative partners may terminate their agreements with us unilaterally for any or no reason.  Given these risks, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative partner arrangements.  We have entered into collaborations in the past that have been subsequently terminated. If other collaborations are suspended or terminated, our ability to commercialize certain other proposed product candidates could also be negatively impacted. If our collaborations fail, our product development or commercialization of product candidates could be delayed or cancelled, which would negatively impact our revenue and results of operations.  If our preclinical testing or clinical trials or those of our collaborative partners are delayed or unsuccessful, our business could be significantly harmed.  All of our partner product candidates and proprietary product candidates are in research and development, including preclinical testing and clinical trials. Preclinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and uncertain processes. It may take us, or our collaborative partners, several years to complete clinical trials, and failure can occur at any stage and at any time. Typically, there is a high rate of attrition for product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not necessarily predict success in later clinical trials. Two of our important proprietary product candidates, NKTR-102 (PEGylated irinotecan) and NKTR-118 (PEGylated naloxol), are currently scheduled to enter Phase II clinical trials in the fourth quarter of 2007 with such trials planned to continue throughout 2008. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later stage clinical trials due to such factors as inconclusive results and adverse medical events, even after achieving positive results in earlier trials that were satisfactory both to them and to the reviewing regulatory agencies. If our partner product candidates or proprietary product candidates fail during any clinical trial stage, it could have a significant and adverse impact on our business prospects.    31    Table of Contents We depend on third parties to conduct our proprietary product candidate clinical trials and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could harm our development and commercialization plans.  We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third party service providers and our collaborators to conduct clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials and do not control many aspects of their activities. For example, the investigators are not our employees. However, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The early termination of any of these clinical trial arrangements, the failure of these collaborators to comply with the regulations and requirements governing clinical trials, or the reliance upon results of trials that we have not directly conducted or monitored could hinder or delay the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates.  If we or our partners do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates on a timely basis or at all, or if the terms of any approval impose significant restrictions or limitations on use, then our revenue and results of operations will be affected negatively.  There is a risk that we, or our partners, will not obtain regulatory approval (which in some countries includes pricing approval) for product candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or that the terms of any approval will impose significant restrictions or limitations on use. Product candidates must undergo rigorous animal and human testing and an extensive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated or equivalent foreign authorities’ review process for safety and efficacy. This process generally takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The time required for completing such testing and obtaining such approvals is uncertain. The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies also have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials, require additional testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and mandate product withdrawals, including recalls. Even though our partners have obtained regulatory approval for some of our products, these products and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Even if we or our partners receive regulatory approval of a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. In addition, any marketed products and manufacturing facilities used in the manufacture of such products will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections. Later discovery from such review and inspection of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketed products or on us, including withdrawal of such products from the market, recall, or suspension of our manufacturing operations. The failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of product candidates, any product marketing limitations or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our revenue and results of operations.  Our collaboration agreements with our partners contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes or litigation that could materially and adversely affect our revenue, results of operations or financial condition.  We currently derive, and expect to derive in the foreseeable future, all of our revenue from collaboration agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These collaboration agreements contain complex commercial terms including:        •    research and development performance and reimbursement obligations for our personnel and other resources allocated to partner product development programs;        •    clinical and commercial manufacturing agreements, some of which are priced on an actual cost basis for products supplied to partners by us with complicated cost calculation and allocation formulas and methodologies;        •    intellectual property ownership allocation between us and our partners for improvements and new inventions developed during the course of the collaborative partnership;        •    royalties on end product sales based on a number of complex variables including net sales calculations, cost of goods, geography, patent life and other financial metrics; and        •    indemnity obligations for third-party intellectual property, infringement, product liability and certain other claims.  From time to time, we have informal dispute resolution discussions with our partners regarding the appropriate interpretation of the complex commercial terms contained in our collaboration agreements. One or more disputes may arise in the future regarding our collaborative contracts that may ultimately result in costly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which would have a material adverse impact on our revenue, results of operations or financial condition.    32    Table of Contents If earthquakes and other catastrophic events strike, our business may be harmed.  Our corporate headquarters, including a substantial portion of our research and development and manufacturing operations, are located in the San Francisco Peninsula, a region known for seismic activity. A significant natural disaster such as an earthquake would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There are no backup facilities for our manufacturing operations located in the San Francisco Peninsula and in the event of any earthquake or other natural disaster or terrorist event, we would not be able to manufacture and supply bulk powder drugs without significant disruption. Certain of our collaborative partners located elsewhere may also be subject to catastrophic events such as hurricanes and tornadoes, any of which could have harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business and financial results from a major earthquake or other catastrophic events such as fires, power loss, terrorist activity or other disasters and do not have a recovery plan for such disasters. In addition, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate us for actual losses from interruption of our business that may occur.  Risks Related to Our Industry  Our manufacturing operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to governmental regulatory requirements that if not met would have a material negative impact on our revenue, results of operations and financial position.  We and our contract manufacturers are required to maintain compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, including any additional cGMP guidelines applicable to active pharmaceutical ingredients, and are subject to inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. We anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of our drug manufacturing facilities and the device manufacturing facilities of our contract manufacturers for compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure to follow and document our or our contract manufacturers’ adherence to such cGMP regulations or satisfy other manufacturing and product release regulatory requirements may lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study, may result in the termination or hold on a clinical study, or may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulations may also result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business. The results of these inspections could also result in costly manufacturing changes or facility or capital equipment upgrades such that the FDA is satisfied that the manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with cGMP. Manufacturing delays for us or our contract manufacturers pending resolution of regulatory deficiencies or suspensions would have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations.  If we are not able to manufacture products in commercially feasible quantities or at commercially feasible costs, then our proprietary product candidates or those of our partners will not be successfully commercialized.  If we are not able to scale-up manufacturing to meet the drug quantities required to support large clinical trials or commercial manufacturing in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost, we risk not meeting our collaborative partners’ supply requirements, our contractual obligations or supply requirements for our proprietary product candidates. Building and validating commercial-scale manufacturing facilities and processes, recruiting and training qualified personnel and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals is complex, expensive and time-consuming. In addition, we also sometimes face very limited supply for certain critical raw materials from single or a limited number of suppliers that could constrain our manufacturing output. Failure to manufacture products in commercially feasible quantities or at commercially feasible costs, would negatively impact our revenue and results of operations and cause us not to meet our customers’ supply requirements, contractual obligations or requirements for our proprietary product candidates.  We are currently involved in legal proceedings and may incur substantial litigation costs and liabilities, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.  Third parties from time to time have asserted or may assert that we or our commercial partners are infringing their proprietary rights based upon their patents that they believe cover our technology. In addition, future patents may issue to third parties that may give rise to similar assertions of infringement. We agree, in certain circumstances, to indemnify and hold harmless our collaborative partners from intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our commercial partners against any such claims. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability or the ability of our partners to develop or commercialize some or all of our products or product candidates in the     33    Table of Contents  U.S. and abroad, and could result in the award of substantial damages. We cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any pending litigation or future litigation. Costs associated with such litigation, substantial damage claims, indemnification claims, or royalties paid for licenses from third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  On August 1, 2006, Novo Nordisk filed a lawsuit against Pfizer in federal court claiming that Pfizer willfully infringes on Novo’s patents covering inhaled insulin with Exubera. The case is currently proceeding with discovery and other pre-trial activities. Although we are not currently a named party in this litigation, we have incurred litigation costs as a result of such litigation and may incur substantial future costs and potential indemnity claims from Pfizer associated with the litigation. These and other disputes may have a material impact on our business, results of operation and financial condition.  If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.  The manufacture, testing, marketing and sale of medical products involves an inherent risk of product liability. If product liability costs exceed our product liability insurance coverage, we may incur substantial liabilities that could have a severe negative impact on our financial position. Whether or not we were ultimately successful in product liability litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, and might result in adverse publicity, all of which would impair our business. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain our clinical trial insurance or product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all, and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims or losses.  If any of our pending patent applications do not issue or following issuance are deemed invalid, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection. We rely on trade secret protection for important proprietary technologies.  We have filed patent applications (and we plan to file additional patent applications) covering, among other things, aspects of our Pulmonary Technology (in general and as it relates to specific molecules) including, without limitation, our powder processing technology, our powder formulation technology, and our inhalation device technology; our PEGylation Technology; and certain other early stage technologies. We own over 1,000 U.S. and foreign patents and a number of patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies.  The patent positions of pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies, including ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues. There can be no assurance that patents we apply for will issue, or that patents that have issued will be valid and enforceable. Even if such patents are enforceable, we anticipate that any attempt to enforce our patents could be time consuming and costly. Additionally, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. As a consequence, we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in patents with broad coverage, or if any issued patents will be subjected to further proceedings to limit their scope so as not to provide meaningful protection or whether the claims that eventually issue or that have issued will be circumvented or otherwise invalidated. In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost. Since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lag behind the date such discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our patents or patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require us to cease using the technology in dispute. Further, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following commercialization of products.  There are many laws, regulations and judicial decisions that dictate and otherwise influence the manner in which patent applications are filed and prosecuted and in which patents are granted and enforced. Changes to these laws, regulations and judicial decisions are subject to influences outside of our control and may negatively affect our business, including, but not limited to, our ability to obtain meaningful patent coverage or enforcement rights of any of our issued patents. Further, new laws, regulations and judicial decisions may be retroactive in effect, thereby potentially reducing or eliminating our ability to implement our patent-related strategies. The changes to the laws, regulations and judicial decisions that affect our business are often difficult or impossible to foresee, thereby potentially limiting our ability to adequately adapt our patent strategies these changes.  We also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.    34    Table of Contents We may be required to obtain intellectual property licenses from third parties and there is a risk we may not be able to obtain such licenses on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.  Numerous pending and issued U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights owned by third parties relate to pharmaceutical compositions, medical devices, and equipment and methods for preparation, packaging, and delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, patent references will be considered relevant to our or our collaborative partners’ technology by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternate technology. The failure to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, if needed, would have a material adverse effect on us.  Significant competition for our technology platforms, our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates could make our technologies, products or product candidates obsolete or uncompetitive, which would negatively impact our revenue and results of operations.  There are competitors to our platform technologies and partnered and proprietary products and product candidates. Some of our competitors with regard to our Pulmonary Technology include Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Alkermes, Inc., Aradigm Corporation, 3M, MannKind Corporation, Microdose Technologies Inc., Skyepharma and Vectura. Some of our competitors with regard to our PEGylation Technology include Dow Chemical Company, Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SunBio Corporation, Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Neose, NOF Corporation and Valentis, Inc., and there may be several chemical, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical companies also developing PEGylation technologies. Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others are developing the technology for internal use.  There are several direct competitors with development programs underway for inhaled insulin products. If these products are approved, they could be competitive to Exubera or our next-generation inhaled insulin product candidate. These companies include Novo Nordisk, Alkermes, Inc. in collaboration with Eli Lilly Company, MannKind Corporation, and Kos Pharmaceuticals, all of which are working on various versions of inhaled insulin products in either a liquid or dry powder form. Some products are in late stage clinical testing including Alkermes’s inhalable insulin product (AIR Insulin System™) in Phase 3 clinical development and Mannkind’s Technosphere® Insulin System also in Phase 3 clinical development. There are other smaller companies that we believe are developing oral or buccal products for insulin delivery, such as Biocon, Emisphere Technologies, Inc., Coremed Corporation, and Generex Biotechnology Corporation. Inhaled insulin products also compete with approved injectable insulins, including both fast-acting and longer-acting basal insulins, as well as other treatment modalities for diabetes including oral agents and other injectable products approved for patients with Type 2 diabetes, such as Amilyn Pharmaceutical’s Byetta.  Many of our competitors have greater research and development capabilities, experience, manufacturing, marketing, financial and managerial resources than we do and represent significant competition for us. Acquisitions of or collaborations with competing drug delivery companies by large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies could enhance our competitors’ financial, marketing and other resources. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies, obtaining regulatory approval for products, or gaining market acceptance before us. Developments by others could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. There can be no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals, and commercialize next-generation products or new products that will successfully compete with those of certain of our competitors.  If government and private insurance programs do not provide reimbursement for our partnered products or proprietary products, those products will not be widely accepted, which would have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations.  In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our partners’ products and any of our proprietary products that have received approval will depend in part upon our ability to gain market acceptance among physicians and patients, pricing approvals by government authorities and the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government health administration authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Such third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services. Therefore, significant uncertainty exists as to the pricing approvals for, and the reimbursement status of, newly approved health care products. For example, since Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients have current insulin therapies available to them (primarily injectable and oral insulin therapies), an important factor in the commercial success of our next-generation inhaled insulin program would be the timing and availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, in addition to patients’ overall willingness to adopt a new form of insulin therapy. Moreover, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before regulatory agencies approve our proposed products for marketing. Adoption of such legislation and regulations could further limit pricing approvals for, and reimbursement of, medical products. A government or third-party payor decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursements of, our products would limit market acceptance of such products.    35    Table of Contents We depend on our key technical and management personnel to advance our technology, and the loss of these personnel could impair the development of our products.  We rely and will continue to rely on our key management and scientific staff. Because all employees are employed at-will, they can leave at any time. The loss of key personnel or the failure in our industry to recruit necessary additional qualified personnel could harm our business and results of operations. There is intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies, research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. We will need to continue to recruit experts in the areas of clinical testing, manufacturing, regulatory, finance, marketing and distribution and to develop additional expertise in our existing personnel. If we do not succeed in hiring or retaining necessary personnel or developing this expertise, our business could suffer significantly.  Risks Related to Our Securities  We have implemented certain anti-takeover measures, which make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.  Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:        •    establishment of a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board may be elected at one time;        •    lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;        •    the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;        •    prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders;        •    establishment of advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and        •    limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.  Further, we have in place a preferred share purchase rights plan, commonly known as a “poison pill.” The provisions described above, our “poison pill” and provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market prices. We also have a change of control severance benefits plan which provides for certain cash severance, stock award acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition. This severance plan could discourage a third party from acquiring us.  The prices of our common stock and senior convertible debt are expected to remain volatile.  Our stock price is volatile. During the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2007, based on closing bid prices on the NASDAQ Stock Market, our stock price ranged from $7.63 to $17.20. We expect our stock price to remain volatile. In addition, as our convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, volatility or depressed prices of our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of the notes. Also, interest rate fluctuations can affect the price of our convertible senior notes. A variety of factors may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock or notes, including:        •    announcements of data from, or material developments in, our clinical trial or those of our competitors, including delays in product development, approval or launch;        •    announcements by collaboration partners as to their plans or expectations related to products using our technologies;    36    Table of Contents     •    announcements or terminations of collaborative relationships by us or our competitors;        •    fluctuations in our results of operations;        •    developments in patent or other proprietary rights;        •    announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products that may compete with our approved products or products under development;        •    announcements of changes in governmental regulation affecting us or our competitors;        •    hedging activities by purchasers of our convertible senior notes;        •    litigation brought against us or third parties to whom we have indemnification obligations;        •    public concern as to the safety of drug formulations developed by us or others; and        •    general market conditions.  Our securityholders may be diluted, and the prices of our securities may decrease, by the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants or by future issuances of securities.  We may issue additional common stock, preferred stock, restricted stock units, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. Furthermore, substantially all shares of common stock for which our outstanding stock options or warrants are exercisable are, once they have been purchased, eligible for immediate sale in the public market. The issuance of additional common stock, preferred stock, restricted stock units, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock or the exercise of stock options or warrants would dilute existing investors and could adversely affect the price of our securities.
