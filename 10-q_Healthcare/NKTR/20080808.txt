Item 1A. Risk Factors  Investors in Nektar Therapeutics should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. The risks described below may not be the only ones relating to our company. This description includes any material changes to and supersedes the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2008. Additional risks that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, results of operation, financial condition, cash flow and future prospects and the trading price of our common stock and our abilities to repay our convertible notes could be harmed as a result of any of these risks, and investors may lose all or part of their investment. In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, and our other filings made from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  Risks Related to Our Business  The termination of our partnership with Pfizer and the discontinuance of our efforts to find a new marketing and development partner for Exubera and NGI will reduce our revenue significantly in 2008 as compared to 2007.  From our inception through the end of our 2007 fiscal year, we depended on Pfizer for revenue related to Exubera contract research and manufacturing. Our revenue from Pfizer related to Exubera and NGI was approximately $41.9 million and $106.2 million, representing 64% and 70% of total revenue, for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively. On November 9, 2007, we entered into a termination agreement and mutual release with Pfizer, pursuant to which Pfizer made a one-time payment of $135.0 million to us in satisfaction of all outstanding contractual obligations under our then-existing agreements with Pfizer related to Exubera and the next-generation inhaled insulin development program, also known as NGI. All of our agreements with Pfizer, other than the termination agreement and mutual release, terminated as of November 9, 2007, including our collaborative development and licensing agreement with Pfizer.  Pursuant to our termination agreement and mutual release with Pfizer, Pfizer agreed to provide certain cooperation to assist us in securing a new marketing and development partner for Exubera and NGI. However, on April 9, 2008, we announced that we would cease all efforts to find a new marketing and development partner for Exubera and NGI in response to a new data analysis performed by Pfizer from ongoing clinical trials indicating an increase in the number of new cases of lung cancer in Exubera patients who were former smokers as compared to the control group. Prior to the termination of our partnership with Pfizer, Pfizer had sole responsibility for all regulatory matters, distribution, sales and marketing of Exubera and was also responsible for manufacturing and delivering bulk insulin for powder processing, filling the insulin powder into blister packs for the Exubera inhaler and providing the packaging for the final Exubera product. Thus, we could not derive any future revenue from Exubera or NGI without securing a new marketing and development partner to assist in the manufacture of the products and provide sales, marketing and distribution services. However, as a result of the termination of our partnership with Pfizer and the discontinuance of our efforts to find a new partner for Exubera and NGI, we expect to derive no revenue from Pfizer in 2008 and no future revenue from Exubera or NGI.   23    Table of Contents  If the preclinical testing or clinical trials conducted by us or our partners are delayed or unsuccessful, our business could be significantly harmed.  We have a number of partnered product candidates and proprietary product candidates in research and development, including preclinical testing and clinical trials. Preclinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and uncertain processes. It may take us, or our collaborative partners, several years to complete clinical trials. We have limited experience in clinical development. Failure can occur at any stage and at any time, regardless of how successful the results from preclinical and prior clinical testing may have been. Typically, there is a high rate of attrition for product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials due to safety, efficacy or other factors. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not necessarily predict success in later clinical trials. A number of other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later stage clinical trials (i.e., Phase 2 or Phase 3 trials) due to factors such as inconclusive results and adverse medical events, even after achieving positive results in earlier trials that were satisfactory both to them and to reviewing regulatory agencies. If our partnered product candidates or proprietary product candidates fail during any clinical trial stage, it could have a significant and adverse impact on our business prospects. The timing of the completion of clinical trials and the availability of data from those trials can be very difficult to estimate due to many factors, including but not limited to, clinical trial design, the rate of qualified patient enrollment, changing standards of care (alternative treatments, patient screening testing), the time it takes to reach clinical trial end points, and certain other medical and scientific developments that are not controlled by us or our partners. Therefore, the completion of clinical trials and the availability of data from those trials can take much longer than we plan.  Because our proprietary product candidates are in the early stages of development, there is a high risk of failure, and we may never succeed in developing marketable products or generating revenue from our proprietary product candidates.  Our efforts to apply our pulmonary technology and PEGylation technology to our proprietary product development programs may fail. None of our proprietary product candidates have received regulatory approval and our development efforts may not result in a commercialized product. Drug development is an uncertain process that involves trial and error, and we may fail at numerous stages along the way or choose to discontinue development. Development of our proprietary product candidates will require extensive time, effort and cost in preclinical testing and clinical trials and will involve a lengthy regulatory review process before they can be marketed. In particular, successful pre-clinical and Phase 1 clinical study results do not necessarily predict success in later stage clinical trials. It can also be very difficult to estimate the commercial potential of early stage product candidates due to factors such as safety and efficacy when compared to other available treatments, including potential generic drug alternatives with similar efficacy profiles, changing standards of care, patient and physician preferences and the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the long drug development process or after commercial introduction. Although NKTR-102 (PEG-irinotecan) and NKTR-118 (oral PEG-naloxol) entered Phase 2 clinical development in late 2007, because of the substantial risks and uncertainties of clinical programs at this early stage of development, there is no assurance that either product will be approved for marketing or, if approved, will be accepted and used by patients and physicians.  Our strategy to develop our proprietary product candidates prior to seeking partnership arrangements may be unsuccessful and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our strategy is to fund our proprietary product development programs, including some or all of the clinical trials, prior to partnering with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. While we believe this strategy may result in improved economics for our proprietary product candidates, it will require significant investment by us without reimbursement. For example, we may expand the number of clinical trials for one or more of our proprietary product candidates to additional therapeutic indications to increase the likelihood of success but such strategy can be very expensive and may not result in a successful trial in any of the therapeutic indications due to one or more factors. As a result, we bear an increased economic risk in the event one or more of our proprietary product candidates does not receive regulatory approval or is not successfully commercialized. Even if the development of a proprietary product is ultimately successful, our increased investment could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition prior to commercialization since we will have fewer funds available to invest in other products and efforts.   24    Table of Contents  If we are unable to establish and maintain partnerships on commercially attractive terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.  We intend to continue to seek partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to fund some of our research and development expense and develop and commercialize product candidates. For instance, we secured partnerships in 2007 based on our pulmonary and PEGylation technology, namely with the execution of a co-development, license and co-promotion agreement with Bayer for NKTR-061 and an exclusive research, development, license and manufacturing and supply agreement with Baxter for Hemophilia B, respectively. The timing of any future partnership, as well as the terms and conditions of the partnership, will affect our results of operation and financial condition. If we are unable to find suitable partners or to negotiate acceptable collaborative arrangements with respect to our existing and future product candidates or the licensing of our technology, or if any arrangements we negotiate, or have negotiated, include unfavorable commercial terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.  If product liability claims are brought against us, we may incur significant liabilities and suffer damage to our reputation.  The manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical and pharmaceutical products involve inherent product liability risks. Although Pfizer owns the new drug application with the FDA for Exubera and had sole responsibility for preparing prescribing information for physicians and the Exubera patient medication guide, as well as for the sales and marketing of Exubera, there remains a risk of product liability claims being brought against us. Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, potential decrease in demand for products based on our technology platforms, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers and loss of revenue, all of which would impair our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, product liability claims could result in substantial judgments or settlements. Our insurance coverage may not cover or be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise, and we may not be able to maintain our clinical trial insurance or product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all. If our product liability costs exceed our product liability insurance coverage, we may incur substantial liabilities that could have a severe negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For instance, such uninsured liabilities could deplete financial resources that would otherwise be used to complete the development or commercialization of our product candidates.  We expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.  In the three months and six months ended June 30, 2008, we reported net losses of $33.4 million and $74.1 million, respectively. If and when we achieve profitability depends upon a number of factors, including the timing and recognition of milestone payments and license fees received, the timing of revenue under collaboration agreements, the amount of investments we make in our proprietary product candidates, the regulatory approval and market success of our product candidates and the success of our strategy to fund our proprietary product development programs prior to partnering with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We may not be able to achieve and sustain profitability.  Other factors that will affect whether we achieve and sustain profitability include our ability, alone or together with our partners, to:       •   develop products utilizing our technologies, either independently or in collaboration with other pharmaceutical or biotech companies;         •   receive necessary regulatory and marketing approvals;         •   maintain or expand manufacturing at necessary levels;         •   achieve market acceptance of our partner products;         •   receive royalties on products that have been approved, marketed or submitted for marketing approval with regulatory authorities; and         •   maintain sufficient funds to finance our activities.     25    Table of Contents     If we do not generate sufficient cash flow through increased revenue or raising additional capital, we may not be able to meet our substantial debt obligations.  As of June 30, 2008, we had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and investments in marketable securities valued at approximately $373.9 million and approximately $343.6 million of indebtedness, including approximately $315.0 million in convertible subordinated notes, $22.9 million in capital lease obligations and $5.7 million of other liabilities. We expect to use a substantial portion of our cash to fund our ongoing operations over the next few years. In 2012, $315.0 million of our 3.25% convertible subordinated notes will mature.  Our substantial indebtedness has and will continue to impact us by:       •   making it more difficult to obtain additional financing;         •   constraining our ability to react quickly in an unfavorable economic climate;         •   constraining our stock price; and         •   constraining our ability to invest in our proprietary product development programs.    Currently, we are not generating positive cash flow and the negative impact to our revenue of the termination of our Exubera and NGI efforts, and corresponding expectation that we will derive no future revenue associated with those products, may further reduce our ability to meet our debt obligations. If we are unable to satisfy our debt service requirements, substantial liquidity problems could result. In relation to our convertible subordinated notes, since the market price of our common stock is significantly below the conversion price, the holders of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes are unlikely to convert the notes to common stock in accordance with the existing terms of the notes. If we do not generate sufficient cash from operations to repay principal or interest on our remaining convertible subordinated notes, or satisfy any of our other debt obligations, when due, we may have to raise additional funds from the issuance of equity or debt securities or otherwise restructure our obligations. Any such financing or restructuring may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.  If we cannot raise additional capital, our financial condition will suffer.  We have no material credit facility or other material committed sources of capital. To the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital needs, we will have to raise additional funds from new collaboration partnerships or the capital markets to continue the marketing and development of our technologies and proprietary products. Such funds may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. We may be unable to obtain suitable new collaboration partners on attractive terms and our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain additional capital markets financing. If adequate funds are not available on reasonable terms, we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing, supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms. Our inability to raise capital could harm our business and our stock price. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities would result in dilution to our stockholders.   26    Table of Contents  Our revenue has historically depended on revenue from collaboration agreements, causing significant fluctuation in our revenue from period to period.  Other than revenue from sales of Exubera inhalation powder and inhaler devices to Pfizer in 2007 and 2006, historically, our revenue is principally derived from collaboration agreements with partners. Such revenue includes milestone payments and reimbursement of a portion of our research and development expense charged to our partners pursuant to collaborative arrangements with them. The amount of our revenue derived from collaboration agreements in any given period will depend on a number of unpredictable factors, including our ability to find and maintain suitable partners, the timing of the negotiation and conclusion of collaboration agreements with such partners, whether and when we achieve milestones agreed upon with our partners, whether the partnership is exclusive or whether we can seek other partners, the timing of regulatory approvals and the market introduction of new products, as well as other factors.  If our partners, on which we depend to obtain regulatory approvals for and to commercialize our partnered products, are not successful, or if such collaborations fail, the development or commercialization of our partnered products may be delayed or unsuccessful.  When we sign a collaborative development agreement or license agreement to develop a product candidate with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, the pharmaceutical or biotechnology company is generally expected to:       •   synthesize active pharmaceutical ingredients to be used in the product candidate;         •   design and conduct large scale clinical studies;         •   prepare and file documents necessary to obtain government approvals to sell a given product candidate; and/or         •   market and sell our products when and if they are approved.    Our reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including risks that:       •   we may be unable to control whether, and the extent to which, our partners devote sufficient resources to the development programs or commercial efforts;         •   disputes may arise in the future with respect to the ownership of rights to technology or intellectual property developed with partners;         •   disagreements with partners could lead to delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of product candidates or to litigation or arbitration;         •   contracts with our partners may fail to provide us with significant protection, or to be effectively enforced, in the event one of our partners fails to perform;         •   partners have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional product candidates and may pursue alternative technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors;         •   partners with marketing rights may choose to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our products than they do to products of their own development;         •   the timing and level of resources that our partners dedicate to the development program will affect the timing and amount of revenue we receive;         •   partners may be unable to pay us as expected; and         •   partners may terminate their agreements with us unilaterally for any or no reason, in some cases with the payment of a termination fee penalty and in other cases with no termination fee penalty.     27    Table of Contents     Given these risks, the success of our current and future partnerships are highly uncertain.  We have entered into collaborations in the past that have been subsequently terminated, such as our collaboration with Pfizer for Exubera and NGI. If other collaborations are suspended or terminated, our ability to commercialize certain other proposed product candidates could also be negatively impacted. If our collaborations fail, our product development or commercialization of product candidates could be delayed or cancelled, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  If we or our partners do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all, or if the terms of any approval impose significant restrictions or limitations on use, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.  We or our partners may not obtain regulatory approval for product candidates on a timely basis, if at all, or the terms of any approval (which in some countries includes pricing approval) may impose significant restrictions or limitations on use. Product candidates must undergo rigorous animal and human testing and an extensive FDA mandated or equivalent foreign authorities’ review process for safety and efficacy. This process generally takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The time required for completing testing and obtaining approvals is uncertain, and the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials, require additional testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and mandate product withdrawals, including recalls. In addition, undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restricted label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by regulatory authorities.  Even if we or our partners receive regulatory approval of a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. Our partnered products that have obtained regulatory approval, and the manufacturing processes for these products, are subject to continued review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Discovery from such review and inspection of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketed products or on us, including withdrawal or recall of such products from the market, suspension of related manufacturing operations or a more restricted label. For instance, Pfizer’s update of the Exubera labeling in April 2008 to include information in the warnings section for doctors and patients regarding an imbalance of the number of new cases of lung cancer in Exubera patients who were former smokers as compared to the control group could have significantly and negatively impacted the market for Exubera had this product still been actively marketed. The failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of product candidates, any product marketing limitations or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  If we or our partners are not able to manufacture products in quantities and at costs that are commercially feasible, our proprietary and partnered product candidates will not be successfully commercialized.  If we are not able to scale-up manufacturing to meet the drug or inhaler device quantities required to support large clinical trials or commercial manufacturing in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost, we risk not meeting our supply requirements and contractual obligations. Building and validating large scale clinical or commercial-scale manufacturing facilities and processes, recruiting and training qualified personnel and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals is complex, expensive and time consuming. We also sometimes face very limited supply of a critical raw material that can only be obtained from a single, or a limited number of, suppliers, which could constrain our manufacturing output which could negatively impact our revenues or delay progress of clinical programs. In addition, in the past we have encountered challenges in scaling up manufacturing to meet the requirements of large scale clinical trials without making modifications to the drug formulation or device design which has the potential to cause significant and unanticipated delays in clinical development. Failure to manufacture products in quantities or at costs that are commercially feasible could cause us not to meet our supply requirements, contractual obligations or other requirements for our proprietary or partner product candidates and, as a result, would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.   28    Table of Contents  If government and private insurance programs do not provide reimbursement for our partnered products or proprietary products, those products will not be widely accepted, which would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our partnered and proprietary products that have received regulatory approval will depend in part on market acceptance among physicians and patients, pricing approvals by government authorities and the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, such as government health administration authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Such third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services. Therefore, significant uncertainty exists as to the pricing approvals for, and the reimbursement status of, newly approved healthcare products. Moreover, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before regulatory agencies approve our proposed products for marketing and could further limit pricing approvals for, and reimbursement of, our products from government authorities and third-party payers. A government or third-party payer decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursements of, our products would limit market acceptance of such products.  We depend on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could harm our development and commercialization plans.  We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates. Though we rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials and are ultimately responsible for the results of their activities, many aspects of their activities are beyond our control. For example, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial, but the independent clinical investigators may prioritize other projects over ours or communicate issues regarding our products to us in an untimely manner. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The early termination of any of our clinical trial arrangements, the failure of third parties to comply with the regulations and requirements governing clinical trials or our reliance on results of trials that we have not directly conducted or monitored could hinder or delay the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and would adversely effect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our manufacturing operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to governmental regulatory requirements, which, if not met, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We and our contract manufacturers are required to maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), including cGMP guidelines applicable to active pharmaceutical ingredients, and are subject to inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. We anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of our drug manufacturing facilities and the device manufacturing facilities of our contract manufacturers for compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure to follow and document our or our contract manufacturers’ adherence to such cGMP regulations or satisfy other manufacturing and product release regulatory requirements may lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study, result in the termination or hold on a clinical study or delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulations may also result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business. The results of these inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes or facility or capital equipment upgrades to satisfy the FDA that our manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with cGMP. Manufacturing delays, for us or our contract manufacturers, pending resolution of regulatory deficiencies or suspensions would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   29    Table of Contents  If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.  The patent positions of pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues. We own over 220 U.S. and over 1,200 foreign patents and a number of patent applications pending that cover various aspects of our technologies. We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our technologies, including our pulmonary technology, both in general and as it relates to specific molecules, our powder processing technology, our powder formulation technology, our inhalation device technology, our PEGylation technology and certain other of our early stage technologies. There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be valid and enforceable or that patents for which we apply will issue with broad coverage, if at all. The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued and, as a consequence, our patent applications may result in patents with narrow coverage. Since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lag behind the date of such discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our patents or patent applications. As part of the patent application process, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable. Further, an issued patent may undergo further proceedings to limit its scope so as not to provide meaningful protection and any claims that have issued, or that eventually issue, may be circumvented or otherwise invalidated. Any attempt to enforce our patents or patent application rights could be time consuming and costly. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require us to cease using the technology in dispute. Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following commercialization of related products.  There are many laws, regulations and judicial decisions that dictate and otherwise influence the manner in which patent applications are filed and prosecuted and in which patents are granted and enforced. Changes to these laws, regulations and judicial decisions are subject to influences outside of our control and may negatively affect our business, including our ability to obtain meaningful patent coverage or enforcement rights to any of our issued patents. New laws, regulations and judicial decisions may be retroactive in effect, potentially reducing or eliminating our ability to implement our patent-related strategies to these changes. Changes to laws, regulations and judicial decisions that affect our business are often difficult or impossible to foresee, which limits our ability to adequately adapt our patent strategies to these changes.  We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost. Any loss of trade secret protection or other unpatented proprietary rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our technology on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.  Numerous pending and issued U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights owned by third parties relate to pharmaceutical compositions, medical devices and equipment and methods for preparation, packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, patent references will be considered relevant to our or our collaborative partners’ technology by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternate technology. If we are required to enter into a license with a third party, our potential economic benefit for the products subject to the license will be diminished. The failure to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, if needed, would have a material adverse effect on us.   30    Table of Contents  Significant competition for our technology platforms, our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates could make our technologies, products or product candidates obsolete or uncompetitive, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our platform technologies and partnered and proprietary products and product candidates compete with various pharmaceutical and biotech companies. In the PEGylation technology field, our competitors include Dow Chemical Company, Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SunBio Corporation, Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Neose Technologies, Inc., NOF Corporation and Urigen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies may also be developing PEGylation technologies. Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others are developing the technology for internal use. Our competitors in the pulmonary technology field include Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Alkermes, Inc., Aradigm Corporation, 3M Company, MannKind Corporation, Microdose Technologies, Inc., SkyePharma Plc and Vectura Group Plc.  There are several competitors for our proprietary product candidates currently in development. For NKTR-061 (inhaled Amikacin), the current standard of care includes several approved intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of either hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients on mechanical ventilators. For NKTR-118 (PEGylated naloxol), there are currently several alternative therapies used to address opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OBD) including over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners such as docusate sodium, senna and milk of magnesia. In addition, there are a number of companies developing potential products which are in various stages of clinical development and are being evaluated for the treatment of OIC and OBD in different patient populations, including Adolor Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Wyeth, Mundipharma International Limited, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. For NKTR-102 (PEG-irinotecan), there are a number of approved therapies for the treatment of colorectal cancer, including Eloxatin, Camptosar, Avastin, Erbitux, Vectibux, Xeloda, Adrucil and Wellcovorin. In addition, there are a number of drugs in various stages of preclinical and clinical development from companies exploring cancer therapies or improved chemotherapeutic agents to potentially treat colorectal cancer, including, but not limited to, products in development from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Alchemia Limited, Antigenics Inc., F. Hoffman La Roche Ltd., Novartis AG, Cell Therapeutics, Inc., Neopharm, Inc., Meditech Research Limited, Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and others.  There can be no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize next-generation or new products that will successfully compete with those of our competitors. Many of our competitors have greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales, manufacturing and managerial capabilities. We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies. As a result, our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies, obtaining regulatory approval or gaining market acceptance for products before we do. These developments could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.  Our collaboration agreements with our partners contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes or litigation that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We currently derive, and expect to derive in the foreseeable future, all of our revenue from collaboration agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These collaboration agreements contain complex commercial terms, including:       •   research and development performance and reimbursement obligations for our personnel and other resources allocated to partnered product development programs;         •   clinical and commercial manufacturing agreements, some of which are priced on an actual cost basis for products supplied by us to our partners with complicated cost calculation and allocation formulas and methodologies;         •   intellectual property ownership allocation between us and our partners for improvements and new inventions developed during the course of the partnership;         •   royalties on end product sales based on a number of complex variables, including net sales calculations, cost of goods, geography, patent life and other financial metrics; and         •   indemnity obligations for third-party intellectual property, infringement, product liability and certain other claims.         31    Table of Contents     From time to time, we have informal dispute resolution discussions with our partners regarding the appropriate interpretation of the complex commercial terms contained in our collaboration agreements. One or more disputes may arise in the future regarding our collaborative contracts that may ultimately result in costly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  We could be involved in legal proceedings regarding our intellectual property rights, or those of our partners, and may incur substantial litigation costs and liabilities that will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that we or our partners infringe their proprietary rights. The third party often bases its assertions on a claim that its patents cover our technology. Similar assertions of infringement could be based on future patents that may issue to third parties. In certain of our agreements with our partners, we are obligated to indemnify and hold harmless our partners from intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims, which could cause us to incur substantial costs if we are called upon to defend ourselves and our partners against any claims. If a third party obtains injunctive or other equitable relief against us or our partners, our ability, and that of our partners, to develop or commercialize, or derive revenue from, certain products or product candidates in the U.S. and abroad which could be effectively blocked. For instance, F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd, to which we license our proprietary PEGylation reagent for use in the manufacture of Roche’s MIRCERA product, is currently the subject of a significant patent infringement lawsuit brought by Amgen Inc. related to Roche’s patents for the use of MIRCERA to treat chemotherapy anemia in the U.S. Amgen has received a favorable ruling in U.S. federal district court in the state of Massachusetts and the parties are currently litigating the remedy phase. It is uncertain whether Roche will be prevented from marketing and selling MIRCERA in the U.S. or whether an economic settlement with Amgen will be concluded and approved by the court. Although we are not a party to this lawsuit, if Roche is prevented from marketing and selling MIRCERA in the U.S., it will have a negative impact on our revenue from our license with Roche. Third-party claims could also result in the award of substantial damages to be paid by us or a settlement resulting in significant payments to be made by us. For instance, a settlement might require us to enter a license agreement under which we pay substantial royalties to a third party, diminishing our future economic returns from the related product. For instance, on June 30, 2006, we entered into a litigation settlement related to an intellectual property dispute with the University of Alabama in Huntsville pursuant to which we paid $11.0 million and agreed to pay an additional $10.0 million in equal $1.0 million installments over ten years beginning on July 1, 2007. We cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any pending or future litigation. Costs associated with such litigation, substantial damage claims, indemnification claims or royalties paid for licenses from third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our future depends on the proper management of our current and future business operations and their associated expenses.  Our business strategy requires us to manage our business to provide for the continued development and potential commercialization of our proprietary and partnered product candidates. Our strategy also calls for us to undertake increased research and development activities and to manage an increasing number of relationships with partners and other third parties, while simultaneously managing the expenses generated by these activities. If we are unable to manage effectively our current operations and any growth we may experience, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our restructuring efforts in February 2008 resulted in a reduction of approximately 110 employees, or approximately 20 percent of our regular full-time staff. If we are unable to effectively manage our expenses, we may find it necessary to reduce our personnel-related costs through further reductions in our workforce, which could harm our operations, employee morale and impair our ability to retain and recruit talent. Furthermore, if adequate funds are not available, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with partners or other sources that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products that we would not otherwise relinquish.   32    Table of Contents  We are dependent on our management team and key technical personnel, and the loss of any key manager or employee may impair our ability to develop our products effectively and may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our success largely depends on the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. The relationships that our key managers have cultivated within our industry make us particularly dependent upon their continued employment with us. We are also dependent on the continued services of our technical personnel because of the highly technical nature of our products and the regulatory approval process. Because our executive officers and key employees are not obligated to provide us with continued services, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty. We do not have any post-employment non-competition agreements with any of our employees and do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key employees. On February 8, 2008, Hoyoung Huh, our Chief Operating Officer and Head of the PEGylation Business Unit, resigned from his positions with us effective February 29, 2008. In May 2008, we appointed Bharatt M. Chowrira as our Chief Operating Officer and Head of the PEGylation Business Unit and as Chairman of Nektar Therapeutics India Pvt. Ltd. In the future, if we are unable to retain our executive officers and key employees or integrate new members of our management team, our operations may be disrupted and we may not be able to achieve our business objectives.  Because competition for highly qualified technical personnel is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel we need to support our operations and growth.  We must attract and retain experts in the areas of clinical testing, manufacturing, regulatory, finance, marketing and distribution and develop additional expertise in our existing personnel. We face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies, research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel. Many of the organizations with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources than we have. Because competition for skilled personnel in our industry is intense, companies such as ours sometimes experience high attrition rates with regard to their skilled employees. Further, in making employment decisions, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment. Our equity incentive plan and employee benefit plans may not be effective in motivating or retaining our employees or attracting new employees, and significant volatility in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.  If earthquakes and other catastrophic events strike, our business may be harmed.  Our corporate headquarters, including a substantial portion of our research and development and manufacturing operations for bulk powder drugs, are located in the Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity and a potential terrorist target. In addition, we own facilities for the manufacture of products using our PEGylation technology in Huntsville, Alabama and lease offices in Hyderabad, India. There are no backup facilities for our manufacturing operations located in the Bay Area and Huntsville, Alabama. In the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster or terrorist event in any of these locations, our ability to manufacture and supply certain products would be significantly disrupted and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed. Our collaborative partners may also be subject to catastrophic events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business, results of operations and financial condition from a major earthquake or other catastrophic event, such as a fire, power loss, terrorist activity or other disaster, and do not have a recovery plan for such disasters. In addition, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate us for actual losses from any interruption of our business that may occur.  We have implemented certain anti-takeover measures, which make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.  Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:       •   establishment of a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board may be elected at one time;         •   lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;     33    Table of Contents      •   the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;         •   prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders;         •   establishment of advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and         •   limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.    Further, we have in place a preferred share purchase rights plan, commonly known as a “poison pill.” The provisions described above, our “poison pill” and provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market prices. We also have a change of control severance benefits plan which provides for certain cash severance, stock award acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition. This severance plan could discourage a third party from acquiring us.  Risks Related to Our Securities  The prices of our common stock and senior convertible debt are expected to remain volatile.  Our stock price is volatile. In the three months ended June 30, 2008, based on closing bid prices on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, our stock price ranged from $3.35 to $7.35. We expect our stock price to remain volatile. In addition, as our convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, volatility or depressed prices of our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of the notes. Interest rate fluctuations can also affect the price of our convertible senior notes. A variety of factors may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock or notes, including:       •   announcements of data from, or material developments in, our clinical trials or those of our competitors, including safety data indicating potential risks in the use of our proprietary or partnered product candidates, such as the inclusion of information in the labeling regarding a data imbalance observing an increased number of lung carcinoma in users of Exubera who were former smokers, or delays in the development, approval or launch of our proprietary product candidates;         •   announcements of changes in governmental regulation, orders or recommendations affecting us or our competitors, such as Pfizer’s update of the Exubera labeling in April 2008;         •   public concern as to the safety of drug formulations, such as Exubera, developed by us or others;         •   product liability claims against us or our partners or litigation brought against us by, or by us against, third parties to whom we have indemnification obligations;         •   announcements by collaboration partners as to their plans or expectations related to products using our technologies;         •   announcements or terminations of collaborative relationships by us or our competitors, such as Pfizer’s announcement late in our 2007 fiscal year that it had terminated our partnership for Exubera and NGI;         •   developments in patent or other proprietary rights;         •   announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products that may compete with our approved products or products under development;         •   hedging activities by purchasers of our convertible senior notes;         •   fluctuations in our results of operations; and         •   general market conditions.     34    Table of Contents     Our securityholders may be diluted, and the price of our securities may decrease, by the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants or by future issuances of securities.  We may issue additional common stock, preferred stock, restricted stock units or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. Furthermore, substantially all shares of common stock for which our outstanding stock options or warrants are exercisable are, once they have been purchased, eligible for immediate sale in the public market. The issuance of additional common stock, preferred stock, restricted stock units or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock or the exercise of stock options or warrants would dilute existing investors and could adversely affect the price of our securities.
