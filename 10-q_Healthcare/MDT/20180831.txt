Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskCURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISKDue to the global nature of our operations, we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes which may cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. We use operational and economic hedges, as well as currency exchange rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated transactions in other currencies and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the contract, the derivative instrument is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. The primary currencies of our derivative instruments are the Euro, Japanese Yen, and British Pound. Fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged, such as in certain emerging markets, may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility. We do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes.The gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at July 27, 2018 and April 27, 2018 was $11.8 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively. At July 27, 2018, these contracts were in a net unrealized gain position of $104 million. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at July 27, 2018 indicates that, if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened/weakened by 10 percent against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase/decrease by approximately $950 million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis. INTEREST RATE RISKWe are subject to interest rate risk on our short-term investments and our borrowings. We manage interest rate risk in the aggregate, while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs. Our debt portfolio at July 27, 2018 was comprised of debt predominately denominated in U.S. dollars, of which approximately 95% is fixed rate debt and approximately 5% is floating-rate debt. We are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments, which include our marketable debt securities, fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements, and forward starting interest rate swap agreements.A sensitivity analysis of the impact on our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates, compared to interest rates at July 27, 2018, indicates that the fair value of these instruments would correspondingly change by $70 million.For a discussion of current market conditions and the impact on our financial condition and results of operations, please see the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of the current period's Management's Discussion and Analysis. For additional discussion of market risk, refer to Notes 6 and 8 to the current period's consolidated financial statements.66Item 4. Controls and ProceduresEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) and changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are effective.CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGThe Company is deploying an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software program, SAP, to the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, the Company continued the deployment of this software along with other enterprise systems, which resulted in changes to the internal controls over financial reporting for the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group in Latin America. The internal controls were updated to reflect these changes. These system deployments will continue with projected completion in fiscal year 2020. There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.PART II — OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.
