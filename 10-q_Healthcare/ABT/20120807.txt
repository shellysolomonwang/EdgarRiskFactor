Item 1A. Risk Factors   There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Abbott’s 2011 Form 10-K, except for the following:   Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business and a cyber attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s results of operations.   Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of Abbott’s information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Abbott’s systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. Abbott has invested in its systems and the protection of its data to reduce the risk of an invasion or interruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns that could have a significant effect on Abbott’s business.   23        Item 2.
