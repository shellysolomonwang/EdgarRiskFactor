Item 1A. Risk Factors   There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Abbott’s 2011 Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, except for the following:   Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.   Abbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and   23        time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and in substantial additional costs.   In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. Many of Abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of Abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott’s products, and criminal prosecution. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott’s business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott’s products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of Abbott’s facilities while Abbott or Abbott’s suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability and financial condition.   Abbott is a party to a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) relating to Abbott’s United States pharmaceuticals business. The CIA requires enhancements to certain compliance procedures and contains numerous reporting and monitoring obligations. If Abbott fails to comply with the CIA, it may be subject to monetary penalties or exclusion from federal health care programs. Abbott also submitted to a term of probation that is initially set at 5 years, and will be shortened to 3 years upon the separation of Abbott and AbbVie Inc., Abbott’s wholly-owned subsidiary formed to hold Abbott’s research-based pharmaceuticals business. The conditions of probation include certain reporting requirements, maintenance of certain compliance measures, certifications of the CEO and board of directors, and other conditions. If Abbott violates the terms of its probation, it may face additional monetary sanctions and other such remedies as the court deems appropriate. The obligations under the CIA and the conditions of probation became effective in October 2012 and transfer to and become fully binding on AbbVie upon the separation and distribution.   24        Item 2.
