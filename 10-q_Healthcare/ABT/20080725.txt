Item 1A. Risk Factors   There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Abbott’s 2007 Form 10-K, except for the following:   The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott’s business could suffer.   The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability.   Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.   Many other factors can affect Abbott’s profitability and its financial condition, including:   · Differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount.   · Changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and environmental laws in domestic or foreign jurisdictions.   · Changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott’s equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts.   · Changes in business and political conditions, including (i) war, political instability, terrorist attacks in the U.S. and other parts of the world, the threat of future terrorist activity in the U.S. and other parts of the world and related military action, (ii) natural disasters, (iii) the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events, (iv) labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs or other forms of labor or union activity, and (v) pressure from third-party interest groups.   · Changes in Abbott’s business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future.   · Changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors and business partners.   · Difficulties related to Abbott’s information technology systems, any of which could adversely affect business operations, including any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of these systems.   · In connection with Abbott’s acquisition of the vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses of Guidant Corporation, Abbott loaned BSC International Holding, Limited (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific) $900 million on a subordinated basis. As long as the loan is outstanding, Abbott will be a creditor of Boston Scientific with respect to the $900 million loan and, as such, is subject to credit risk.   · Legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, adverse litigation decisions, and issues regarding compliance with any governmental consent decree or corporate integrity agreement.   20        Item 2.
