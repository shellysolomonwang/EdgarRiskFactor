Item 1A. Risk Factors   There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Abbott’s 2009 Form 10-K, except for the following:   Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott’s business.   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law on March 23, 2010 and March 30, 2010, respectively. A number of the provisions of those laws require rulemaking action by governmental agencies to implement, which has not yet occurred. The laws change access to health care products and services and create new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking.   23        Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
