Item 1A. Risk Factors   There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Abbott’s 2009 Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, except for the following:   Significant safety issues could arise for Abbott’s products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and financial condition.   All health care products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. If serious safety issues with an Abbott product arise, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott’s products.   In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business and reputation and on Abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are generally self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition.   Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.   Many other factors can affect Abbott’s profitability and its financial condition, including:   · Differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount.   · Changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, and environmental laws in domestic or foreign jurisdictions.   26        · Changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott’s equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts.   · Changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts.   · Changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks in the U.S. and other parts of the world, the threat of future terrorist activity in the U.S. and other parts of the world and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups.   · Changes in Abbott’s business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future.   · Changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners.   · Difficulties related to Abbott’s information technology systems, any of which could adversely affect business operations, including any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction, or interruption of these systems.   · Changes in credit markets impacting Abbott’s ability to obtain financing for its business operations.   · Legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, adverse litigation decisions, and issues regarding compliance with any governmental consent decree.   27        Item 2.
