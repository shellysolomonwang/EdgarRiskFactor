Item 1A. Risk Factors Perrigo Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2013 includes a detailed discussion of the Company’s risk factors. Other than the items noted below, there have been no material changes during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 to the risk factors that were included in the Form 10-K.Risks Relating to the Company's BusinessThe Company operates in a highly regulated industry. An inability to meet current or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position and operating results. On February 10, 2014, the FDA published an interim final rule (“IFR”) entitled “Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Quality Control Procedures, Quality Factors, Notification Requirements, and Records and Reports, for Infant Formula.” The IFR includes, among other things, new or modified requirements related to infant formula manufacturing, quality controls, record-keeping, and clinical trials. While it is uncertain how the FDA will interpret and enforce the IFR or whether FDA will modify any of the IFR provisions prior to the July 10, 2014 effective date, the Company is taking steps to comply with the provisions of the IFR. Compliance with the IFR may require significant expenditures and lead to delays in commercialization of new infant formula products, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. To the extent the FDA believes that the Company has not complied with the IFR, it could lead to potential supply chain disruptions and additional delays in commercialization of new infant formula products, which could impede the Company’s sales and revenue and adversely affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations.Changes in tax laws or income tax rates, or the resolution of any pending or future tax audit, examination or challenge, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and the ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner.  A number of factors may adversely impact the Company's future effective tax rates, such as income tax rate changes by governments; the jurisdictions in which the Company's profits are determined to be earned and taxed, and the relative amounts of income in these jurisdictions; changes in the valuation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; adjustments to the Company's interpretation of transfer pricing standards, changes in available tax credits, grants and other incentives; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws (e.g., proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform); changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; expiration or the inability to renew tax rulings or tax holiday incentives; and the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings with respect to which the Company has not previously provided for U.S. taxes. A change in the Company's effective tax rate due to any of these factors may adversely impact the Company's future results from operations. Also, changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner. In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by its relevant tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of outcomes from these examinations, if predictable, to determine the Company’s estimated income tax liabilities. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is currently auditing fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and the Israeli Tax Authority is currently auditing fiscal years 2011 and 2012. There are numerous other income tax returns that are not yet settled, none of which is individually significant. The outcome from these audits or other examinations or challenges could result in material income taxes and income tax liabilities. The Company's reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program and other governmental purchasing and rebate programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any determination that the Company has failed to comply with those obligations could subject it to penalties and sanctions, which could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. The regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations with respect to Medicaid reimbursement and rebates and other governmental programs are complex. The Company's calculations and methodologies are subject to review and challenge by the governmental agencies, and it is possible that such reviews could result in changes. In addition, because these  52Table of Contentscalculations involve, and will continue to involve, subjective decisions and complex methodologies, they are subject to the risk of errors. Any governmental agencies that have commenced or that may commence an investigation of the Company could impose civil and/or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties and possible exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicaid and Medicare). Furthermore, should there be ambiguity with regard to how to properly calculate and report payments, and even in the absence of any such ambiguity, a governmental authority may take a position contrary to a position that we have taken and may impose civil and/or criminal sanctions on us. Any such penalties, sanctions, or exclusion from federal health care programs could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of its common stock to decline. In June 2013, the Company received notices from the Office of the Attorney General for the State of Texas, of civil investigative demands to two of the Company’s affiliates, Perrigo Pharmaceuticals Company and Paddock Laboratories, LLC, for information under the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act relating to the submission of prices to Texas Medicaid in claims for reimbursement for drugs. The Company has cooperated with requests for information and is in the process of evaluating this and other information. While the Company does not know the full extent of its potential liability at this time and intends to vigorously defend against any claims, the Company could be subject to material penalties and damages. The Company cannot predict whether settlement on terms acceptable to it will occur, or that a settlement or potential liability for these claims will not be material. Risks Relating to the Elan AcquisitionThe Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Elan acquisition, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. The Company may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses.The Company's ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Elan acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on its ability to integrate the Perrigo and Elan businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, the Company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Perrigo and Elan. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by the Company. The Company's failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the Elan acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the Company's activities and could adversely affect the Company's results of operations.In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management’s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:•the diversion of management’s attention to integration matters;•difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the business of Perrigo with that of Elan;•difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; and•difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company.Many of these factors will be outside of the Company's control, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of Perrigo. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses of Perrigo and Elan are integrated successfully, the Company may not realize the full benefits of the Elan acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that were expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Or, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of Perrigo and Elan. All of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of Perrigo, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transactions, and negatively impact the price of Perrigo’s ordinary shares. As a result, the Company cannot assure that the combination of the Perrigo and Elan businesses will result in the realization of all anticipated benefits. 53Table of ContentsThe Company's actual financial positions and results of operations may differ materially from the unaudited pro forma financial data included in Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.The pro forma financial information contained in Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of what the Company's financial position or results of operations would have been had the acquisitions been completed on the dates indicated. The pro forma financial information has been derived from the historical financial information of Perrigo Company, Elan and the acquired Fera and Aspen assets, and certain adjustments and assumptions have been made regarding the combined company after giving effect to the transactions. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been measured at fair value based on various preliminary estimates using assumptions that the Company's management believes are reasonable utilizing information currently available. The process for estimating the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires the use of judgment in determining the appropriate assumptions and estimates. These estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. The pro forma financial data is based on a preliminary purchase price allocation, and the actual allocation of the purchase price will be performed only after all purchase price adjustments have been completed. Accordingly, the actual financial condition and results of operations of the combined company may not be consistent with, or evident from, this pro forma financial information. In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Acquisition accounting rules require evaluation of certain assumptions, estimates or determination of financial statement classifications which are completed during the measurement period as defined in current accounting standards. The Company's accounting policies and acquisition accounting rules may materially vary from those of Elan. Any changes in assumptions, estimates, or financial statement classifications may be material and have a material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities or future earnings of the new combined consolidated company. Any potential decline in the Company's financial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations in the Company's share price.The Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) may not agree with the conclusion that the Company is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.Although the Company is incorporated in Ireland, the IRS may assert that it should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the Code. For U.S. federal tax purposes, a corporation generally is considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Because the Company is an Irish incorporated entity, it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.For the Company to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes under section 7874, either (i) the former stockholders of Perrigo Company must own (within the meaning of section 7874) less than 80% (by both vote and value) of the Company's stock by reason of holding shares in Perrigo Company (the “ownership test”) or (ii) the Company must have substantial business activities in Ireland after the Elan acquisition (taking into account the activities of the Company’s expanded affiliated group). As of the acquisition date, Perrigo Company stockholders held 71% (by both vote and value) of the shares in the Company. As a result, the Company believes that under current law, it should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. However, the Company cannot assure that the IRS will agree with the position that the ownership test is satisfied. There is limited guidance regarding the section 7874 provisions, including the application of the ownership test.Section 7874 of the Code likely will limit the Company's and its U.S. affiliates’ ability to utilize their U.S. tax attributes to offset certain U.S. taxable income, if any, generated by the Elan acquisition or certain specified transactions for a period of time following the Elan acquisition.Following the acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a foreign corporation, section 7874 can limit the ability of the acquired U.S. corporation and its U.S. affiliates to utilize U.S. tax attributes such as net operating losses to offset U.S. taxable income resulting from certain transactions. Based on the limited guidance available, the Company currently expects this limitation will apply and as a result, the Company currently does not expect that it or its U.S. affiliates will be able to utilize their U.S. tax attributes to offset their U.S. taxable income, if any, resulting from certain specified taxable transactions. Future changes to the international tax laws could adversely affect the Company. The Company believes that under current law, it should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax  54Table of Contentspurposes. However, changes to the inversion rules in section 7874 could adversely affect the Company's status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application to the Company, Perrigo Company, and/or their respective stockholders, shareholders and affiliates. In addition, recent legislative proposals have aimed to expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence, and such legislation, if passed, could have an adverse effect on the Company.Moreover, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, U.S. Congress, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and other Government agencies in jurisdictions where the Company and its affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting”, where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company and its affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect the Company.A number of factors may limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends in the future. The Company recently created distributable reserves by means of a reduction of share capital which was approved by the shareholders of the Company and the Irish High Court. In the event the Company chooses to seek to create further distributable reserves by means of a further capital reduction, this will also require Irish High Court approval and shareholder approval. The Company is not aware of any reason why the Irish High Court would not approve the further creation of additional distributable reserves by means of a further capital reduction; however the issuance of the required order is a matter for the discretion of the Irish High Court. There will also be no guarantee that shareholder approval will be obtained.The Company’s ability to pay dividends will be limited by the availability of distributable reserves. Although distributable reserves can be created by means of a reduction in capital, the ongoing availability of distributable reserves will depend on whether the Company has, on an individual entity basis, “profits available for distribution” (within the meaning of the Irish Companies Acts); however, the future generation of additional distributable reserves cannot be guaranteed. The Company is a holding company that does not expect to conduct any business operations of its own. As a result, the Company will be dependent on cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from its subsidiaries in order to pay dividends to its shareholders. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made at the discretion of the Company’s board of directors, subject to compliance with applicable laws (including the Irish Companies Acts) and covenants under current or future credit facilities, which may restrict or limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends. The determination also will depend on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that the Company’s board of directors may deem relevant. Irish shareholder voting requirements may limit the Company's flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management.Under Irish law, the authorized share capital of the Company can be increased by an ordinary resolution of its shareholders, and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by the articles of association of the Company or by an ordinary resolution of the Company's shareholders. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash, but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemption rights by way of special resolution with respect to any particular allotment of shares. Accordingly, the Company's articles of association contain, as permitted by Irish company law, a provision authorizing the board to issue new shares for cash without offering preemption rights. The authorization of the directors to issue shares and the authorization of the waiver of the statutory preemption rights must both be renewed by the shareholders at least every five years, and the Company cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved, which could limit the Company's ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of the Company's securities. In certain limited circumstances, dividends paid by the Company may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax.In certain limited circumstances, dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 20%) may arise in respect of dividends, if any, paid on Perrigo ordinary shares. A number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the United States and shareholders resident in certain other countries may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax (the “Relevant Territories”).Shareholders resident in the United States that hold their shares through the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the U.S. (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant  55Table of Contentsinformation to a qualifying intermediary appointed by Perrigo). All U.S. resident shareholders in the Company that hold their shares outside of DTC and shareholders resident in other Relevant Territories will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the beneficial owners of such shares have furnished completed and valid dividend withholding tax forms and an IRS Form 6166, as appropriate, to the Company's transfer agent or their brokers (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to the Company's transfer agent). However, other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of your shares. Dividends received by Irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax.Shareholders entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from the Company will not be subject to Irish income tax in respect of those dividends, unless they have some connection with Ireland other than their shareholding in Perrigo (for example, they are resident in Ireland). Shareholders who are not resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland but who are not entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on those dividends which suffer dividend withholding tax. Perrigo ordinary shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to Irish capital acquisitions tax.Irish capital acquisitions tax (“CAT”) could apply to a gift or inheritance of Perrigo ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties. This is because Perrigo ordinary shares will be regarded as property situated in Ireland. The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT. Children have a tax-free threshold of €225,000 in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents. Biogen Idec is directly responsible for the sales and distribution of Tysabri® and as a result any change in strategy by Biogen Idec or negative developments relating to Tysabri® could have a material impact on the Company’s revenues, operating income and cash flows.The Company acquired a significant revenue stream and a $6.1 billion intangible asset related to sales of the Multiple Sclerosis drug Tysabri® with the acquisition of Elan. The Company collects quarterly royalty payments from Biogen Idec, which is solely responsible for the sales and distribution of the drug. The Tysabri® royalty stream is expected to contribute significant revenues, operating income and cash flows to the Company’s results of operations. Any negative developments relating to Tysabri®, such as safety, efficacy or reimbursement issues, the introduction or greater acceptance of competing products, including biosimilars, or adverse regulatory or legislative developments may reduce the payments the Company receives and adversely affect the results of operations. New competing products for use in the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis are beginning to (or will soon) enter the market, including BG-12 for which Biogen Idec has filed for marketing approval in the United States and Europe. If any of these competing products have a similar or more attractive profile in terms of efficacy, convenience or safety, future sales of Tysabri® could be limited, which would reduce royalties received. Tysabri®'s sales growth cannot be assured given the significant restrictions on its use and the significant safety warnings in the label, including the risk of developing Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy ("PML"), a serious brain infection. The risk of developing PML increases with prior immunosuppressant ("IS") use, which may cause patients who have previously received IS or their physicians to refrain from using or prescribing Tysabri®. The risk of developing PML also increases with longer treatment duration, with limited experience beyond four years. This may cause prescribing physicians or patients to suspend treatment with Tysabri®. In addition, the risk of developing PML is heightened when a patient has anti-JC virus ("JCV") antibodies. In January 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a product label change for Tysabri® that identifies anti-JCV antibody status as a risk factor for PML. This risk had already been incorporated into the European label for Tysabri® in June 2011. Physicians have discontinued treatment and are likely to continue to discontinue treatment with Tysabri® in patients who test positive for JCV antibodies. Increased incidence of PML could limit sales growth, prompt regulatory review, require significant changes to the label or result in market withdrawal. Additional regulatory restrictions on the use of Tysabri® or safety-related label changes, including enhanced risk management programs, whether as a result of additional cases of PML or otherwise, may significantly reduce expected revenues and require significant expense and management time to address the associated legal and regulatory issues. In addition, ongoing or future clinical trials involving Tysabri®, efforts at stratifying patients into groups with lower or higher risk for developing PML and the commercial availability of the JCV antibody assay may have an adverse impact on prescribing behavior and reduce sales of Tysabri®. Further, the utility of the JCV antibody assay may be diminished as a result of the assay’s false negative rate and because a patient who tests negative for JCV antibodies may be infected by the JCV after testing. Any or all of the above factors could lead to volatility in the number of patients who begin or continue to use Tysabri® or discontinue the use of Tysabri® in any period. 56Table of ContentsThe Company acquired significant assets that could become impaired or subject the Company to losses and may result in an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations.In addition to the $6.1 billion Tysabri® and Prialt distribution and license agreements recorded as intangible assets and described above, the Company also acquired investment securities and equity method investments, and recorded $2.1 billion of goodwill. All of these assets are subject to impairment, which would adversely impact the Company's results of operations. For intangible assets subject to amortization such as Tysabri®, an impairment analysis is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any individual asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Any significant change in market conditions, estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairment in the period that the change becomes known. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company assesses whether temporary or other-than-temporary gains or losses on its investment securities have occurred due to increases or declines in fair value or other market conditions. If losses are considered other-than-temporary, the credit loss portion is charged to operations and the non-credit loss portion is charged to OCI. If the Company determines that a loss in the value of its equity method investments is other than temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value. Any such losses are recorded to (income) loss from equity method investments. Evaluations of recoverability under ASC 323 are primarily based on projected cash flows. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates. Additionally, the equity method of accounting requires the Company to record a proportionate share of the profits and losses of its equity method investments. Between December 18, 2013, the date the Company acquired Elan, and March 29, 2014, the Company recorded a total of $5.2 million of losses on all of its acquired equity method investments. If the entities accounted for as equity method investments experience significant losses, the Company will have to record a proportionate share of those losses, which could significantly impact the Company's results of operations.The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. The test for impairment requires the Company to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds The Company does not currently have an ordinary share repurchase program, but may repurchase shares in private party transactions from time to time. Private party transactions are shares repurchased in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards to satisfy employees' minimum statutory tax withholding obligations. All ordinary shares repurchased by the Company will either be cancelled or held as treasury shares available for reissuance in the future for general corporate purposes.The table below lists the Company’s repurchases of ordinary shares during its most recently completed quarter: Fiscal 2014 TotalNumber ofSharesPurchased (1) AveragePrice Paidper Share Total Number ofShares Purchasedas Part of PubliclyAnnounced Plans Value ofSharesAvailable forPurchase         December 29 to February 1 894 $155.49 — $—February 2 to March 1 137 $159.06 — $—March 2 to March 29 — $— — $—Total 1,031   —   (1)Private party transactions accounted for all purchases from December 29 to March 29.Item 4.
