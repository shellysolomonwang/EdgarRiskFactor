ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors. At the time of this filing, there have been no material changes to the risk factors that were included in the Form 10-K, other than described below.We identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting; failure to remediate the material weaknesses could negatively impact our business and the price of our ordinary shares.In connection with our review of certain material misstatements related to the characterization of the Tysabri® royalty stream acquired in the Elan transaction, as well as material misstatements related to the calculation of deferred tax liabilities that existed at the time of the acquisition of Omega, and the evaluation of long-lived assets in our animal health reporting unit for impairment testing, in each case contained in certain of our historical financial statements, we concluded that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that contributed to those misstatements. As a result of the material weaknesses, which existed at December 31, 2016 and some of which remained at September 30, 2017, we have concluded that we did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, April 1, 2017, July 1, 2017 or September 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). The failure to maintain effective control over financial reporting in turn resulted in material deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures. We have identified and begun the implementation of actions, and continue to identify and implement, actions to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, but there can be no assurance that such remediation efforts will be successful. We have also incurred and will continue to incur substantial accounting, legal, consulting, and other costs in connection with identifying and remediating the material weaknesses. Failure to remediate the material weaknesses could have a negative impact on our business and the market for our ordinary shares. For more information on our material weaknesses and the status of our remediation efforts, See Part I, Item 4 - Controls and Procedures.We are currently involved in a search for a new Chief Executive Officer and a subsequent search for a permanent Chief Financial Officer. If these searches are delayed, our business could be negatively impacted. On June 5, 2017, we announced the forthcoming retirement of John T. Hendrickson as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hendrickson will continue to serve as our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board until such time as a successor has been appointed. Our Board of Directors has initiated a Chief Executive Officer search process and has retained an executive search and leadership advisory firm to assist with the process of identifying and evaluating candidates.  55Perrigo Company plc - Item 1ARisk FactorsIn addition, on February 21, 2017, we announced the resignation of Judy L. Brown as our Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer, effective February 27, 2017. Since that time, Ronald L. Winowiecki has served as our acting Chief Financial Officer. Although Mr. Winowiecki remains a key candidate for our permanent Chief Financial Officer, our Board of Directors has suspended its Chief Financial Officer search during its search for Mr. Hendrickson’s successor as Chief Executive Officer. There are no assurances concerning the timing or outcome of our search for a new Chief Executive Officer or subsequent search for a permanent Chief Financial Officer. If there are any delays in this process, or if any transition is not successful, our business could be negatively impacted.The resolution of uncertain tax positions could be unfavorable, which could have an adverse effect on our business.Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that our tax filings are prepared in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on operating results or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties or interest assessments.•On August 15, 2017, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan to recover $163.6 million of Federal income tax, penalties, and interest assessed and collected by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), plus statutory interest thereon from the dates of payment, for the fiscal years ended June 27, 2009, June 26, 2010, June 25, 2011, and June 30, 2012 (the “2009 tax year,” “2010 tax year,” “2011 tax year,” and “2012 tax year,” respectively). The IRS audits of those years culminated in the issuances of two statutory notices of deficiency: (1) on August 27, 2014 for the 2009 and 2010 tax years and (2) on April 20, 2017 for the 2011 and 2012 tax years. The statutory notices of deficiency both included un-agreed income adjustments related principally to transfer pricing adjustments regarding the purchase, distribution, and sale of store-brand OTC pharmaceutical products in the United States. In addition, the statutory notice of deficiency for the 2011 and 2012 tax years included the capitalization of certain expenses that were deducted when paid or incurred in defending against certain patent infringement lawsuits. We fully paid the assessed amounts of tax, interest, and penalties set forth in the statutory notices and filed timely claims for refund on June 11, 2015 and June 7, 2017 for the 2009-2010 tax years and 2011-2012 tax years, respectively. Our claims for refund were disallowed by certified letters dated August 18, 2015 and July 11, 2017, for the 2009-2010 tax years and 2011-2012 tax years, respectively. The complaint was timely, based upon the refund claim denials, and seeks refunds of tax, interest, and penalties of $37.2 million for the 2009 tax year, $61.5 million for the 2010 tax year, $40.2 million for the 2011 tax year and $24.7 million for the 2012 tax year. The amounts sought in the complaint for the 2009 and 2010 tax years were recorded as deferred charges on our balance sheet during the three months ended March 28, 2015, and the amounts sought in the complaint for the 2011 and 2012 tax years were recorded as deferred charges on our balance sheet in the second quarter of the year ending December 31, 2017.•On December 22, 2016, we received a notice of proposed adjustment for the IRS audit of Athena Neurosciences, Inc. (“Athena”), a subsidiary of Elan Corporation plc (“Elan”) acquired in 1996, for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. We acquired Elan in December 2013. This proposed amendment relates to the deductibility of litigation costs. We disagree with the IRS’s position asserted in the notice of proposed adjustment and intend to contest it. On July 11, 2017, we received a draft notice of proposed adjustment associated with transfer pricing positions for the IRS audit of Athena for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. Athena was the originator of the patents associated with Tysabri® prior to the acquisition of Athena by Elan in 1996. The amount of adjustments that may be asserted by the IRS in the final notice of proposed adjustment cannot be quantified at this time; however, based on the draft notice received, the amount to be assessed may be material. We disagree with the IRS’s position as asserted in the draft notice of proposed adjustment and intend to contest it. 56Perrigo Company plc - Item 1ARisk FactorsThere are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which are individually significant. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of any audit or related litigation. Unfavorable resolutions of the audit matters discussed above could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods. ITEM 2.
