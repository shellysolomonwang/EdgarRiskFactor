Item 1A. Risk FactorsThe Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2014 includes a detailed discussion of the Company’s risk factors. Other than the items noted below, there have been no material changes during fiscal 2015 to the risk factors that were included in the Form 10-K. Risks relating to OmegaThe Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Omega acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. The Company may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses.The Company's ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Omega acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on its ability to integrate the Perrigo and Omega businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. As a result, the Company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Perrigo and Omega. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by the Company. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the Company and could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management’s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:•difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, and growth prospects from combining the businesses;•difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; and•difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complexcompany.Many of these factors will be outside of the Company's control, and any one of them could result in increased or anticipated costs, decreases in the amount of expected sales, and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially impact the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses of Perrigo and Omega are integrated successfully, the Company may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings, sales, or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. All of these factors could cause dilution to the Company's earnings per ordinary share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Omega acquisition, and negatively impact the price of the Company's ordinary shares. The Company's business has historically focused on the U.S. market, while Omega operates primarily in Europe. The success of the Company's expansion in Europe as a result of the Omega acquisition depends on a number of factors.Historically, the Company has largely focused on the U.S. market. Omega operates primarily in European markets. After the Omega acquisition, the Company’s expansion in Europe could subject it to additional business, financial, and competitive risks. The Company’s success in the European markets in which Omega operates will depend on a number of factors, such as:•consistency and transparency of foreign tax systems, transfer pricing stability across jurisdictions, and ability to reinvest earnings and cash as appropriate;•appropriate compliance with import or export licensing requirements; 45Table of Contents•compliance with differing regulatory and legal requirements, including tax laws, trade laws, labor, safety, local content, and consumer protection regulations;•ability to adapt to changes in economic and political conditions; and•fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates.Many of these factors are beyond the Company's control, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased sales, and diversion of management’s time and energy, any or all of which could materially impact the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.Omega’s strategy is dependent upon its broad European commercial and regulatory network and OTC branded product sales. If the reputation of Omega or one or more of its brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on the Company's combined financial results. Omega’s reputation is the foundation of its relationships with key stakeholders and other counterparties, such as customers and suppliers. In addition, many of Omega’s brands have European recognition. This recognition is the result of the large investments that Omega has made in its products over many years. The quality and safety of Omega's products are critical to its business. If Omega is unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, sentiments toward Omega or its products could be negatively impacted, its ability to operate freely could be impaired, and the Company's combined financial results could suffer.Omega’s financial success is directly dependent on the success of its brands, and the success of these brands can suffer if marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or ability to attract consumers. The Company's results could also be negatively impacted if an Omega brand's reputation is impaired by a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering, or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. Negative or inaccurate postings or comments about Omega could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of its brands. In addition, given the association of individual products within Omega's commercial network, an issue with one of its products could negatively affect the reputation of other products, or Omega as a whole, thereby potentially hurting results.The uncertainties associated with the Omega acquisition may cause key personnel of Omega to leave. In connection with the acquisition, key employees of Omega may perceive uncertainty about their future role until strategies regarding the combined business are fully executed. Any uncertainty may affect the Company's ability to retain key management, sales, marketing, research and development, technical, and financial personnel. The loss of key personnel may impede the achievement of the Company's objectives with the Omega acquisition.Political, economic and governmental instability in Russia and Ukraine could materially adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.Political, ethnic, religious, historical, and other differences have, on occasion, given rise to tensions within certain regions of Russia and Ukraine. Further, political and economic relations between the United States and Russia and Ukraine, two of the jurisdictions in which Omega operates, are complex. The current situation in Ukraine and Crimea, along with the response of the governments of Russia, the United States, member states of the European Union, the European Union itself, and other nations to this situation, has the potential to materially adversely affect Omega’s operations in Russia and Ukraine. In connection with the current situation in Ukraine, the United States, the European Union, and certain other states have imposed a broad array of sanctions against Russian and Crimean officials, Russian businesses and certain businessmen, including sectoral sanctions applicable to businesses operating in certain sectors of the economy, including energy and finance. Russia has responded with certain countermeasures, including limiting the import of certain goods from the United States and other countries. While the Company does not anticipate that the current sanctions will materially affect Omega’s business directly, if further sanctions are ordered by the European Union, the United States, or other international interests, such sanctions may materially adversely affect Omega’s operations in Russia and the Ukraine. 46Table of ContentsOmega has not historically been subject to certain U.S. anti-corruption, anti-bribery and economic sanctions laws and regulations to which the Company's business is subject. Any non-compliance could have a negative effect on the Company's business operations, financial condition or results of operations.Omega has operations, assets, and/or makes sales throughout Europe and in other countries around the world and is now subject to certain laws and regulations to which it was not subject prior to the acquisition, including those related to privacy, anti-corruption, and anti-bribery. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. State Department administer certain laws and regulations that impose penalties upon U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. entities, for conducting activities or transacting business with certain countries, governments, entities, or individuals subject to such laws and regulations. While Omega has not historically been subject to U.S. laws and regulations, it has been subject to the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, which is more restrictive. Although the Company believes that Omega conducts its business in compliance with applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and economic sanctions laws, the comparable U.S. laws and regulations to which Omega is now subject to may differ in certain ways from those to which Omega was historically subject. Therefore, the Company may determine that certain Omega sales or other activities that were permitted while Omega was an independent company may no longer be permitted. The Company will put into place compliance processes and controls intended to ensure compliance with all U.S. and global laws that now apply to Omega, but might not have applied in the past. If Omega’s operations fail to comply with such laws and regulations, the Company could be subject to governmental investigations, legal or regulatory proceedings, substantial fines, and/or other legal or equitable penalties. Any non-compliance could have a negative effect on the Company's business operations, financial condition, or results of operations.Omega is subject to regulation by various governmental agencies for manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, storing, distribution, advertising, and sales. Changes to existing regulation and/or introduction of new regulation may materially adversely affect Omega’s operations and the conduct of its business.Various governmental agencies regulate the manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, storing, distribution, advertising, and sale of Omega’s products. Changes to existing regulation and/or introduction of new regulation may materially adversely affect Omega’s operations and the conduct of its business. Should Omega or one of its third-party suppliers fail to comply with these laws and regulations, it could result in fines, sanctions, increased costs of compliance or third-party litigation, as well as damage to Omega’s brands and reputation.Omega maintains several single-source supplier relationships. Unavailability or delivery delays of single-source supplier components or products could adversely affect Omega’s ability to ship the related product in a timely manner.Omega maintains several single-source supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous due to regulatory, performance, quality, support, or price considerations. Unavailability or delivery delays of single-source components or products could adversely affect Omega’s ability to ship the related product in a timely manner. Omega also grows, cultivates and harvests raw materials for several naturally occurring products. Climate change and vulnerability of crops to attack by insects, pests, fungus and disease may affect raw material yields, which could materially adversely affect Omega’s ability to supply the related products to customers.Risks Related to Capital Resources and LiquidityThe Company's leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect the business. The Company's total indebtedness as of March 28, 2015 was $4.7 billion, which includes $1.6 billion raised to finance the Omega acquisition. This amount does not include the $1.4 billion principal amount of Omega debt the Company assumed in connection with the closing of the acquisition on March 30, 2015. On April 8, 2015, the  47Table of ContentsCompany repaid $539.1 million of debt that Omega had outstanding under its revolving credit facility and terminated the facility. The degree to which the Company is leveraged could have important consequences for the Company, including, but not limited to:•increasing the Company's vulnerability to, and reducing its flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;•requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of the Company's cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, or other general corporate purposes;•limiting the Company's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the business and the competitive environment and the industry in which the Company operates;•placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage to the extent that its competitors are not as highly leveraged; and•limiting the Company's ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.Risks Related to the BusinessThe Company operates globally and a portion of its net sales, assets, indebtedness and other liabilities and costs are denominated in foreign currencies. The addition of Omega, a euro-denominated business, will represent a significant portion of the consolidated Company’s future results. Currency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates, particularly the EUR/USD exchange rate post the Omega acquisition, could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial conditions, and results of operations.Although the Company reports its financial results in U.S. dollars, a portion of the Company’s net sales, assets, indebtedness and other liabilities, and costs are denominated in foreign currencies, including among others the euro, Indian rupee, British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and Mexican peso. The addition of Omega, a euro-denominated business which will represent a significant portion of the Company's future net sales and earnings, as well as substantial portion of its net assets, significantly increases the Company’s exposure to changes in the EUR/USD exchange rate. In addition, approximately 25% of Omega’s sales are in other foreign currencies with the majority of the product costs for these markets denominated in euros. The Company’s results of operations and, in some cases, cash flows, have in the past been and may in the future be adversely affected by movements in exchange rates. From time to time, the Company may implement currency hedges or take other actions intended to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Notwithstanding the Company's efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in exchange rates on its business, its efforts may not be successful. Therefore, the Company will continue to be subject to market fluctuations in exchange rates which could materially impact its results.Mylan’s unsolicited proposal to purchase all of the Company's outstanding ordinary shares may be disruptive to the business and could have a negative effect on the Company’s business operations, financial condition, or results of operations.           On April 6, 2015, Mylan N.V. ("Mylan") sent the Company a letter containing an unsolicited proposal to acquire all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Perrigo for $205.00 per share (the "Proposal"), which Mylan made public on April 8. Following a comprehensive review, the Company's Board of Directors unanimously rejected the Proposal, concluding that it substantially undervalued the Company and its future growth prospects, and was not in the best interests of Perrigo’s shareholders. On April 24, 2015 Mylan provided a firm offer to acquire all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Perrigo for $60.00 per share in cash and 2.2 Mylan ordinary shares for each Perrigo ordinary share (the “Offer”). The same day, the Company announced its rejection of the Offer, citing the same reasons as its rejection of the Proposal.On April 29, 2015, Mylan announced a revised offer to acquire all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Perrigo for $75.00 per share in cash and 2.3 Mylan ordinary shares for each Perrigo ordinary share (the “Revised Offer”). The same day, the Company announced its rejection of the Revised Offer.Prior to making the Proposal, Mylan was the subject of market speculation related to a possible offer for Mylan from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ("Teva"). On April 21, 2015, Teva announced an unsolicited  48Table of Contentsproposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Mylan for $82.00 per share, with the consideration to be comprised of approximately 50 percent cash and 50 percent stock. On April 27, 2015, Mylan announced that its Board of Directors had rejected this proposal, following which Teva announced that it reiterated its commitment to its proposal.The uncertainty regarding Mylan’s future actions or further pursuit of a revised proposal or offer may disrupt the Company's business, which could have a negative effect on its business operations, financial condition, or results of operations. Responding to the Proposal, Offer, and Revised Offer has been, and may continue to be, a distraction for management and employees, and has required, and may continue to require, the Company to incur additional expenses and costs. Management and employee distraction related to the Proposal, Offer, Revised Offer, or any additional revised proposal or offer also may adversely impact the Company's ability to optimally conduct its business and pursue its strategic objectives.The Company has direct interactions with health care professionals, which is often referred to as physician detailing. Failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations may result in governmental investigation, regulatory action, and legal proceedings. The Company has expanded its pharmaceutical marketing to include direct interactions with health care professionals, which is known as “detailing.” This activity is subject to extensive regulation under a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, including anti-kickback, anti-bribery, and false claims laws; the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act with respect to claims and off-label promotions; and similar laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions. If any of these activities are found to be improper, the Company could be subject to civil and governmental actions and penalties. These risks may increase as non-U.S. jurisdictions adopt new anti-bribery laws and regulations.The Company's increasing role in the global marketplace may place it at greater risk of cyber events or other security incidents adversely affecting the Company’s manufacturing, supply chain, operations and financial position. Company systems, information, and operations, as well as the Company's independent vendor relationships (where they support information technology and manufacturing infrastructure), are vulnerable to disruption or damage from, but not limited to, security breaches, hacking, data theft, denial of service attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss, fire, sabotage, industrial espionage, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, insufficient quality, or pandemic at any of the Company’s facilities. These and other similar events could impair the Company’s ability to develop, meet regulatory approval efforts for, produce and/or ship products on a timely basis. This would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s manufacturing, supply chain, operations and financial position. Given the Company's position in the pharmaceutical industry, it may be more likely to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of such events.While the Company continues to employ resources to monitor its systems and protect its infrastructure, these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed. Any system issue, whether as a result of an intentional breach or a natural disaster, could damage the Company's reputation and cause it to lose customers, experience lower sales volume, incur significant liabilities or otherwise have a negative impact on the business, financial condition, and operating results. The Company also could incur significant expense in addressing any of these problems and in addressing related data security and privacy concerns. 49Table of ContentsTax-related risksChanges in tax laws or income tax rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and the ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner. The Company believes that under current law, it should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. However, changes to the inversion rules in section 7874 of the Code, or the IRS Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, or other IRS guidance, could adversely affect the Company's status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application to the Company, Perrigo Company, and/or their respective stockholders, shareholders and affiliates. In addition, recent legislative proposals have aimed to expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence, and such legislation, if passed, could have an adverse effect on the Company.Moreover, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, U.S. Congress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and other Government agencies in jurisdictions where the Company and its affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of "base erosion and profit shifting", where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company and its affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect the Company.A number of factors may adversely impact the Company's future effective tax rates, such as income tax rate changes by governments; the jurisdictions in which the Company's profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the valuation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; adjustments to the Company's interpretation of transfer pricing standards, changes in available tax credits, grants and other incentives; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws (e.g., proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform); changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; expiration or the inability to renew tax rulings or tax holiday incentives; and the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings with respect to which the Company has not previously provided for U.S. taxes. A change in the Company's effective tax rate due to any of these factors may adversely impact the Company's future results from operations. Also, changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner. Although the Company believes that its tax estimates are reasonable and that the Company's tax filings are prepared in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audit, and any related litigation, could be materially different from the Company's estimates or from the Company's historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on operating results or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties, or interest assessments.The Company is currently under audit by the Israel Tax Authority and the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal 2011 and 2012. The IRS audit of fiscal 2009 and 2010 had previously concluded with the issuance of a statutory notice of deficiency on August 27, 2014. While the Company had previously agreed on certain adjustments and made associated payments of $8.0 million inclusive of interest in November 2014 the statutory notice of deficiency asserted various additional positions, including transfer pricing, relative to the same fiscal 2009 and 2010 audit. The statutory notice asserted an incremental tax obligation of approximately $69.2 million, inclusive of interest and penalties. The Company disagrees with the IRS’s positions asserted in the notice of deficiency and plans to contest them in U.S. Federal court. In January 2015, the Company paid this amount, a prerequisite to being able to contest the IRS’s positions in U.S. Federal court. The payment was recorded in the third fiscal quarter as a deferred charge on the balance sheet given the Company's anticipated action to recover this amount. An unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements in future periods. There are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which are individually significant. At this time, the Company cannot predict the outcome of any audit or related litigation.  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
