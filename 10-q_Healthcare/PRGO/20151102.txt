Item 1A. Risk Factors.We have rejected each of Mylan’s unsolicited proposals, and on September 17, 2015, we filed a solicitation/recommendation statement unanimously recommending that shareholders do not tender into the Exchange Offer.Defending against Mylan's proposals and the Exchange Offer has required, and will continue to require, us to incur fees. During the three months ended September 26, 2015, we incurred $15.6 million in consulting and legal fees related to our defense against Mylan's unsolicited offer. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information on risks relating to the Exchange Offer.We have $517.7 million of outstanding term loans and a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (no borrowings outstanding) as of September 26, 2015, that each have an event of default for changes of control that would be triggered upon Mylan’s acquisition of more than 35% of our ordinary shares in the Exchange Offer. The occurrence of this event of default would give our term lenders the right to immediately accelerate and declare due and payable all of such outstanding term loans and our revolving lenders the right to declare any amounts then outstanding immediately due and payable and all commitments immediately terminated. In addition, an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.9 billion (as of September 26, 2015) of our outstanding public bonds contain change of control provisions that would be triggered if (1) a change of control were to occur and (2) our public bonds were to suffer a rating downgrade to a level below investment grade from both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services. If these provisions were triggered, we would be required to commence a change of control offer to repurchase the public bonds at 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Any of our future debt agreements could contain similar restrictions and provisions. We might not have sufficient funds to repay the amounts due in relation to our debt instruments following a change of control.The consummation of the Exchange Offer also presents additional risks, as discussed in Item 4, “The Solicitation or Recommendation-Reasons for Recommendation” of our Solicitation/Recommendation Statement filed in response to the Exchange Offer on Schedule 14D-9, on September 17, 2015. 25Perrigo Company plc - Item 2ConsolidatedRESULTS OF OPERATIONSCONSOLIDATEDSignificant Trends and DevelopmentsOn October 22, 2015, we announced that we intend to undertake certain initiatives designed to increase operational efficiency and improve our return on invested capital by globalizing our supply chain through global shared service arrangements, streamlining our organizational structure, and disposing of certain assets.

Selling expense as a percent of net sales of the BCH segment was significantly higher for the BCH segment than it was for our other business segments due to advertising and promotional expenses that are unique to the BCH segment.PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALSSegment Results  Three Months Ended($ in millions)September 27, 2014 September 26, 2015Net sales$194.5 $260.3Gross profit$96.4 $130.4Gross profit %49.6% 50.1%Operating income$64.7 $91.0Operating income %33.3% 34.9% 28Perrigo Company plc - Item 2RxThree Months Ended September 26, 2015 vs Three Months Ended September 27, 2014 Segment operating income increased $26.3 million, or 40%, as a result of:• An increase in net sales of $65.8 million, or 34%, due primarily to:•New product sales of $18.4 million related primarily to the launches of clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray and tacrolimus 0.1% ointment;•Increased sales of existing products of $46.7 million; and•Absence of planned contractual wholesaler chargeback and stock adjustments associated with pricing programs completed in the prior year; offset partially by •Unfavorable foreign exchange movement of $1.2 million.•An increase of $34.0 million in gross profit due primarily to:•Higher net sales and an improved gross profit percentage; and •Favorable product mix and absence of pricing initiatives completed in the prior year.•Partially offset by a $7.7 million increase in operating expenses due to:•Higher research and development expenses resulting from planned higher spending on new product development; and•Increased selling and administrative expenses related to the specialty pharmaceuticals sales force.

Unallocated expenses increased from $24.3 million for the three months ended September 27, 2014 to $39.3 million for the three months ended September 26, 2015 due primarily to $15.6 million in fees incurred in our defense against Mylan's unsolicited offer.  Interest and Other (Consolidated)Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 26, 2015 was $43.7 million, compared to $26.1 million for the three months ended September 27, 2014. The increase was due to the interest expense incurred on the incremental debt we issued to finance the Omega acquisition and the additional debt we assumed from Omega. Other expense, net, was $13.0 million during the three months ended September 26, 2015, compared to $2.7 million during the three months ended September 27, 2014. The increase was due mainly to changes in cash balances held in foreign currencies, the largest portion consisting of a $4.6 million foreign exchange loss resulting from the impact of holding €200.0 million ($223.6 million) in cash associated with the euro-denominated purchase price of the GSK acquisition. The increase in Other expense, net, was also due to a $1.3 million increase in losses from equity method investments in the three months ended September 26, 2015, compared to the prior year period, and the absence of a $1.2 million cash distribution received from an investment in the prior year. Income Taxes (Consolidated)The effective tax rate was 14.8% and 11.4% for the three months ended September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, respectively. 30Perrigo Company plc - Item 2Unallocated, Interest, Other, and TaxesAlthough we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that we prepare our tax filings in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audit, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on operating results or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties, or interest assessments. We are under audit by the Israel Tax Authority and the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2011 and June 30, 2012. The IRS audit of the fiscal year ended June 27, 2009 and June 26, 2010 had previously concluded with the issuance of a statutory notice of deficiency on August 27, 2014. While we had previously agreed on certain adjustments and made associated payments of $8.0 million, inclusive of interest, in November 2014, the statutory notice of deficiency asserted various additional positions, including transfer pricing, relative to the same fiscal year ended June 27, 2009 and June 26, 2010 audit. The statutory notice asserted an incremental tax obligation of approximately $68.9 million, inclusive of interest and penalties. We disagree with the IRS’s positions asserted in the notice of deficiency. In January 2015, we paid this amount, a prerequisite to being able to contest the IRS’s positions in U.S. Federal court, and in June 2015, we filed a request for a refund. As the IRS has denied our request for a refund, we intend to contest the IRS’s asserted positions in U.S. Federal court. The payment was recorded as a deferred charge on the balance sheet given our anticipated action to recover this amount. An unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods. There are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which are individually significant. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of any audit or related litigation.FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash and Cash Equivalents* Working capital represents current assets less current liabilities. Cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities are expected to be sufficient to finance our known and/or foreseeable liquidity, capital expenditures, dividends, and, to the extent authorized, our share repurchases. Although our lenders have made commitments to make funds available to us in a timely fashion under our revolving credit agreements and overdraft facilities, if economic conditions worsen or new information becomes publicly available impacting the institutions’ credit rating or capital ratios, these lenders may be unable or unwilling to lend money pursuant to our existing credit facilities.  31Perrigo Company plc - Item 2Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flows OperatingWe generated $136.0 million from operating activities during the three months ended September 26, 2015, a $59.1 million decrease over the comparable prior year period as a result of changes in working capital due primarily to the Omega acquisition. The primary driver of the decrease was payments on accounts payable, which used $194.0 million of cash compared to $32.5 million in the prior year period. The change is largely attributable to Omega as its payments to suppliers are higher in the quarters ended in March and September due primarily to inventory purchases in these periods. Omega has historically experienced favorable operating cash flow in the second and fourth calendar quarters consistent with the sales seasonality of the business. Operating cash flow was also impacted by the use of $57.0 million to increase inventory compared to $29.7 million in the prior year period, which was due primarily to the inclusion of Omega.These decreases were offset partially by increased accrued liabilities of $61.5 million, compared to $0.6 million in the prior year period, due primarily to timing of accrued interest on the debt we assumed in the Omega acquisition, other accruals attributable to Omega, and accrued fees related to our defense against Mylan's unsolicited offer. Additionally, operating cash flow was impacted positively by increased net earnings after adjusting for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, which resulted in an increase in operating cash of $79.9 million over the prior year period. Investing Cash used for investing activities totaled $448.7 million for the three months ended September 26, 2015, an increase of $418.0 million over the comparable prior period. The increase in cash used was due primarily to the acquisitions we completed in the current year, which used $405.1 million in cash. There were no acquisitions during the three months ended September 27, 2014. 32Perrigo Company plc - Item 2Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancingCash generated from financing activities totaled $43.7 million for the three months ended September 26, 2015, compared to cash used for financing activities of $61.3 million for the comparable prior year period. The primary contributor to the cash generation in the current year period was the borrowing of $79.0 million of short-term debt in the current year versus net payments of short-term debt of $2.1 million in the prior year period. The increase in borrowings was due to Omega's use of overdraft facilities in its day-to-day operations. In addition, we used $25.2 million less in the current year period for payments on long-term debt than in the prior year period. The declaration and payment of dividends, if any, is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, availability of distributable reserves, capital and surplus requirements, and other factors our Board of Directors may consider relevant.Capital Resources Accounts Receivable FactoringWe have multiple accounts receivable factoring arrangements with non-related third-party financial institutions (the “Factors”) that we assumed in the Omega acquisition. Pursuant to the terms of the arrangements, we sell to the Factors certain of our accounts receivable balances on a non-recourse basis for credit approved accounts. An administrative fee ranging from 0.14% to 0.15% per invoice is charged on the gross amount of accounts receivables assigned to the Factors, plus interest is calculated at the applicable EUR LIBOR rate plus 70 basis points. The total amount factored and excluded from accounts receivable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was $159.3 million at September 26, 2015, a $12.3 million decrease since June 27, 2015.Revolving Credit Agreements There were no borrowings outstanding under our $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement at September 26, 2015 or June 27, 2015. Long-Term DebtWe had $4.7 billion of public bonds and a $517.7 million term loan outstanding at September 26, 2015, as well as the ability to draw on a €300.0 million term loan. At June 27, 2015, we had $4.7 billion of public bonds and a $530.5 million term loan outstanding. Subsequent to September 26, 2015, we allowed the undrawn €300.0 million term loan tranche to expire.We were in compliance with all covenants under our various debt agreements as of September 26, 2015. See Item 1. Note 8 for more information on all of the above debt facilities. 33Perrigo Company plc - Item 2Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesShare RepurchasesOn October 22, 2015, we announced a $2.0 billion share repurchase plan over three years, including $500.0 million expected to be repurchased during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015. We plan to fund these share repurchases through our available liquidity.Credit Ratings Our credit ratings on September 26, 2015 were Baa3 (stable) and BBB (watch negative) by Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's ("S&P") Rating Services, respectively. On April 9, 2015, after the announcement of Mylan’s unsolicited proposal to acquire all of our outstanding ordinary shares, S&P placed our BBB credit rating on CreditWatch with negative implications. Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in operating performance, the economic environment, our financial position, and changes in business strategy. If changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, and vendor financing terms.ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There have been no material changes to our quantitative or qualitative disclosures found in Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk," of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2015.ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAs of September 26, 2015, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that all material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be included in our periodic SEC filings would be made known to them by others within those entities in a timely manner and that no changes are required at this time. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingIn connection with the evaluation by our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, no changes during the quarter ended September 26, 2015, were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting except as noted below. 34Perrigo Company plc - Item 4Controls and ProceduresChanges in Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe acquired Omega Pharma Invest N.V. ("Omega") and Gelcaps Exportadora de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. ("Gelcaps") during the three months ended June 27, 2015 and we acquired Naturwohl Pharma GmbH ("Naturwohl") during the three months ended September 26, 2015 (see Item 1. Note 2 for additional information). As permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff interpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses, management excluded Omega, Gelcaps, and Naturwohl from its evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2015, other than goodwill and intangible asset controls that have been incorporated into our existing control environment. We are in the process of documenting and testing Omega's, Gelcaps', and Naturwohl's internal controls over financial reporting. We will incorporate the acquired entities into our transition report on internal control over financial reporting for our six-month transition period ending December 31, 2015. As of September 26, 2015, assets excluded from management's assessment totaled $920.8 million and contributed $310.2 million of net sales and $2.9 million of operating income to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended September 26, 2015. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Refer to Part I, Item 1. Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2015 includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors. At the time of this filing, there have been no material changes to the risk factors that were included in the Form 10-K, other than those noted below.We have been the subject of unsolicited interest from Mylan N.V. ("Mylan"), which has been, and may continue to be, a distraction to our management and employees and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. The pharmaceutical industry has been intensely acquisitive over the past several years. Mylan has made an exchange offer to purchase all of our outstanding ordinary shares (the "Exchange Offer"). The uncertainty regarding the Exchange Offer may be disruptive to our business, which could have a negative effect on our operations, financial condition, or results of operations. As discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2015, in April 2015, Mylan made a series of proposals to acquire all our outstanding ordinary shares (the “Proposals”). Our Board of Directors unanimously rejected each of the Proposals, concluding that they substantially undervalued us and our future growth prospects and were not in the best interests of our shareholders. Subsequent to the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have been further developments in Mylan's unsolicited interest in acquiring our shares, including:•On August 28, 2015, Mylan held an extraordinary meeting of its shareholders in which Mylan received the necessary Mylan shareholder approval to move forward with the Exchange Offer. •On September 14, 2015, Mylan commenced the Exchange Offer, which will expire on November 13, 2015, unless it is extended with the consent of the Irish Takeover Panel. The Exchange Offer provides that if all conditions to the Exchange Offer are satisfied or waived, Mylan will exchange $75.00 in cash and 2.3 Mylan ordinary shares for each of our outstanding ordinary shares that is validly tendered. The Exchange Offer is subject to various conditions, including that Mylan receive valid acceptances of holders greater than 50% of Perrigo ordinary shares. •On September 17, 2015, we issued a solicitation/recommendation statement unanimously recommending that our shareholders do not tender into the Exchange Offer. Responding to and defending against the Proposals and the Exchange Offer has been, and may continue to be, a distraction for our management and employees, and has required, and may continue to require, us to incur  35Perrigo Company plc - Item 1ARisk Factorsadditional expenses and costs. Since the announcement of the initial Proposal, we have incurred $29.0 million in consulting and legal fees related to our defense. Management and employee distraction related to Mylan's unsolicited interest also may adversely impact our ability to optimally conduct our business and pursue our strategic objectives. Further, we are deemed to be in an "offer period" for purposes of the Irish Takeover Rules, which may restrict our ability to execute our strategy on a timely basis. We have $517.7 million of outstanding term loans and a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (no borrowings outstanding) as of September 26, 2015, that each have an event of default for changes of control that would be triggered upon Mylan’s acquisition of more than 35% of our ordinary shares in the Exchange Offer. The occurrence of this event of default would give our term lenders the right to immediately accelerate and declare due and payable all of such outstanding term loans and our revolving lenders the right to declare any amounts then outstanding immediately due and payable and all commitments immediately terminated. In addition, an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.9 billion (as of September 26, 2015) of our outstanding public bonds contain change of control provisions that would be triggered if (1) a change of control were to occur and (2) our public bonds were to suffer a rating downgrade to a level below investment grade from both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services. If these provisions were triggered, we would be required to commence a change of control offer to repurchase the public bonds at 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Any of our future debt agreements could contain similar restrictions and provisions. We might not have sufficient funds to repay the amounts due in relation to our debt instruments following a change of control.The consummation of the Exchange Offer also presents additional risks, as discussed in Item 4, “The Solicitation or Recommendation-Reasons for Recommendation” of our Solicitation/Recommendation Statement filed in response to the Exchange Offer on Schedule 14D-9, on September 17, 2015.There can be no assurance that our strategic initiatives will achieve their intended effects. We are in the process of implementing certain initiatives designed to increase operational efficiency and improve our return on invested capital by globalizing our supply chain through global shared service arrangements, streamlining our organizational structure, and disposing of certain assets. We believe these initiatives will enhance our revenue, operating margins and earnings. There can be no assurance that these initiatives will produce the anticipated benefits. Any delay or failure to achieve the anticipated benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.We cannot guarantee that we will buy back our ordinary shares pursuant to our recently announced share repurchase plan or that our share repurchase plan will enhance long-term shareholder value.Our board of directors recently authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase plan, consisting of $500.0 million of initial share repurchases that are expected be completed by the end of 2015, and an additional $1.5 billion in repurchases that may extend through the year ended December 31, 2018. Though we anticipate that we will complete the initial $500.0 million of share repurchases before the end of 2015 and the remaining $1.5 billion in accordance with the announced timeline, the specific timing and amount of buybacks, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our ordinary shares, and, with respect to the expected repurchases in 2016 and beyond, the nature of other investment opportunities. Buybacks of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase plan could affect the market price of our ordinary shares or increase its volatility. Additionally, our share repurchase plan could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. Although our share repurchase plan is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so, and short-term share price fluctuations could reduce the plan’s effectiveness.ITEM 2.
