NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - The   accompanying unaudited interim financial
statements  and  related  notes  should  be   read   in
conjunction with the Consolidated Financial  Statements
of Johnson & Johnson and Subsidiaries  (the  "Company")
and  related notes as contained in the Company's Annual
Report  on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31,  2006.  The unaudited interim financial  statements
include  all  adjustments (consisting  only  of  normal
recurring  adjustments  except  for  the  restructuring
charge  in  note  11)  and accruals  necessary  in  the
judgment  of  management for a fair  statement  of  the
results for the periods presented.

During  the  fiscal first quarter of 2007, the  Company
adopted FASB Interpretation 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB
Statement  No  109.  This interpretation  prescribes  a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial  statement recognition and measurement  of  a
tax  position taken or expected to be taken  in  a  tax
return.   The interpretation also provides guidance  on
derecognition, classification and other  matters.   See
note 3 for more details.


NOTE 2 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The  Company  follows the provisions  of  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 133, SFAS 138 and
SFAS  149 requiring that all derivative instruments  be
recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.

As  of September 30, 2007, the balance of deferred  net
losses  on  derivatives included in  accumulated  other
comprehensive  income was $118 million  after-tax.  For
additional information, see Note 8. The Company expects
that   substantially  all  of  this  amount   will   be
reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a
result of transactions that are expected to occur  over
that period. The amount ultimately realized in earnings
will  differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized
gains  and  losses are ultimately determined by  actual
exchange   rates   at  maturity  of   the   derivative.
Transactions with third parties will cause  the  amount
in accumulated other comprehensive income to affect net
earnings.  The  maximum length of time over  which  the
Company is hedging is 18 months.  The Company also uses
currency   swaps  to  manage  currency  risk  primarily
related to borrowings, which may exceed 18 months.

For  the fiscal third quarters ended September 30, 2007
and  October  1,  2006, the net impact of  the  hedges'
ineffectiveness, transactions not qualifying for  hedge
accounting  and  discontinuance  of  hedges,   to   the
Company's financial statements was insignificant. Refer
to  Note  8 for disclosures of movements in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income.


NOTE 3 - INCOME TAXES
The  worldwide effective income tax rates for the first
fiscal  nine  months of 2007 and 2006  were  25.1%  and
25.2%,  respectively,  a decrease  of  0.1%.  This  was
primarily due to increases in taxable income  in  lower
tax  jurisdictions relative to taxable income in higher
tax  jurisdictions  and  the Research  and  Development
(R&D)  tax credit, which was not in effect in the first
fiscal  nine months of 2006. This was partially  offset
by  higher  IPR&D charges  recorded in the fiscal  nine
months  of  2007  versus 2006, which was non-deductible
for  tax  purposes. The tax rate for the  first  fiscal
nine  months  of  2006 benefited  from  a  reversal  of
deferred  tax valuation allowances associated with  the
Tibotec business.

The   Company  adopted  FIN  No  48,  "Accounting   for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes" effective January 1,  2007
which resulted in the recognition of an additional  $19
million  of previously unrecognized tax benefits,  with
the corresponding adjustment to retained earnings.  The
Company  had $1.1 billion of unrecognized tax  benefits
as of January 1, 2007 including the previous adjustment
mentioned  above.   The  Company  classifies   interest
expense  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax
benefits  as income tax expense.  The total  amount  of
accrued interest on January 1, 2007 was $0.2 billion.

The Company conducts business and files tax returns in
numerous countries and currently has tax audits in
progress with a number of tax authorities.  The U.S.
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)has completed their audit
for tax years through 1999; however, the years 1996
through 1999 remain open while a limited number of
issues are being considered at the IRS appeals level.
In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts
business, the tax years remain open generally back to
the year 2000 with some jurisdictions remaining open
back to 1995.

NOTE 5 - INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL
Intangible  assets that have finite  useful  lives  are
amortized  over their estimated useful lives.  Goodwill
and  indefinite  lived intangible assets  are  assessed
annually   for   impairment.   The  latest   impairment
assessment  of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible
assets  was  completed in the fiscal fourth quarter  of
2006   and   no  impairment  was  determined.    Future
impairment  tests  will be performed  annually  in  the
fiscal  fourth  quarter,  or  sooner  if  warranted  by
economic conditions.

The diluted earnings per share calculation included the
dilutive effect of convertible debt that was offset  by
the related reduction in interest expense of $1 million
for  both the fiscal third quarters ended September 30,
2007 and October 1, 2006.

The diluted earnings per share calculation excluded  66

The diluted earnings per share calculation included the
dilutive effect of convertible debt that was offset  by
the related reduction in interest expense of $3 million
for  both  the first fiscal nine months ended September
30, 2007 and October 1, 2006.

The diluted earnings per share calculation excluded  65
million  and  44 million shares related to options  and

Company Contributions
For  the  fiscal nine months ended September 30,  2007,
the Company contributed $16 million and $15 million  to
its    U.S.   and   international   retirement   plans,
respectively.   The  Company  does  not  anticipate   a
minimum  statutory  funding requirement  for  its  U.S.
retirement plans in 2007.  International plans will  be
funded in accordance with local regulations.

NOTE 11 - RESTRUCTURING

In  the  third  quarter of 2007, the Company  announced
restructuring initiatives in an effort to  improve  its
overall cost structure. This action was taken to offset
the   anticipated  negative  impacts  associated   with
generic  competition in the Pharmaceutical segment  and
challenges in the Drug-Eluting stent market. As part of
this  program  the Company will eliminate approximately
4,400  positions and consolidate certain facilities  in
operations,   primarily  impacting  the  Pharmaceutical
segment and the Cordis franchise of the Medical Devices
and Diagnostics segment.

During  the  fiscal third quarter of 2007, the  Company
recorded  $745  million in pre-tax  charges  of  which,
approximately,    $500   million   of    the    pre-tax
restructuring  charges  are expected  to  require  cash
payments.  The  $745  million of restructuring  charges
consists of      severance costs of $450 million, asset
write  offs of $272 million and $23 million related  to
leasehold obligations. The $272 million of asset  write
offs  relate to property, plant and equipment  of  $166
million,  intangible assets of $48  million  and  other
assets of $58 million.

The  following  table summarizes the severance  charges
and  the  associated  spending  for  the  fiscal  third
quarter of 2007:

(Dollars in Millions)          Severance

*Cash outlays for severance are expected to be paid out
over the next 12 to 18 months.

For additional information on the restructuring as it
relates to the segments see note 6.

NOTE 12 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

PRODUCT LIABILITY

The Company is involved in numerous product liability
cases in the United States, many of which concern
adverse reactions to drugs and medical devices. The
damages claimed are substantial, and while the Company
is confident of the adequacy of the warnings and
instructions for use that accompany such products, it
is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of
litigation. However, the Company believes that if any
liability results from such cases, it will be
substantially covered by existing amounts accrued in
the Company's balance sheet and, where available, by
third-party product liability insurance.

Multiple products of Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries are
subject to numerous product liability claims and
lawsuits, including ORTHO EVRA(R), RISPERDAL(R), DURAGESIC(R)
and the CHARITE(TM) Artificial Disc. There are
approximately 3,000 claimants who have filed lawsuits
or made claims regarding injuries allegedly due to
ORTHO EVRA(R), 620 claimants with respect to RISPERDAL(R),
250 with respect to CHARITE(TM) and 72 with respect to
DURAGESIC(R).  These claimants seek substantial
compensatory and, where available, punitive damages.

With respect to RISPERDAL(R), the Attorneys General of
four states and the Office of General Counsel of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have filed actions seeking
reimbursement of Medicaid or other public funds for
RISPERDAL(R) prescriptions written for off-label use,
compensation for treating their citizens for alleged
adverse reactions to RISPERDAL(R), civil fines or
penalties, punitive damages, or other relief.  The
Attorney General of Texas has joined a qui tam action
in that state seeking similar relief.  Certain of these
actions also seek injunctive relief relating to the
promotion of RISPERDAL(R).  In addition, there are six
cases filed by union health plans seeking damages for
alleged overpayments for RISPERDAL(R), several of which
seek certification as class actions.

Numerous claims and lawsuits in the United States
relating to the drug PROPULSID(R), withdrawn from general
sale by the Company's Janssen Pharmaceutica Inc.
(Janssen) subsidiary in 2000, have been resolved or are
currently enrolled in settlement programs with an
aggregate cap below $100 million in payments by the
Company. Litigation concerning PROPULSID(R) is pending in
Canada, where a class action of persons alleging
adverse reactions to the drug has been certified.

AFFIRMATIVE STENT PATENT LITIGATION

In patent infringement actions tried in Delaware
Federal District Court in late 2000, Cordis Corporation
(Cordis), a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, obtained
verdicts of infringement and patent validity, and
damage awards against Boston Scientific Corporation
(Boston Scientific) and Medtronic AVE, Inc. (Medtronic)
based on a number of Cordis vascular stent patents. In
December 2000, the jury in the damage action against
Boston Scientific returned a verdict of $324 million
and the jury in the Medtronic action returned a verdict
of $271 million. Multiple post-trial proceedings and
appeals have ensued with respect to these verdicts,
with the ultimate outcome still subject to uncertainty.

Cordis also has an arbitration claim against Medtronic
accusing Medtronic of infringement by sale of stent
products introduced by Medtronic subsequent to its
products subject to the earlier action referenced
above. Those subsequent products were found to have
been licensed to Medtronic pursuant to a 1997 license
by an arbitration panel in March 2005. Further
arbitration proceedings will determine whether
royalties are owed for those products.

In January 2003, Cordis filed a patent infringement
action against Boston Scientific in Delaware Federal
District Court accusing its Express2TM, Taxus(R) and
Liberte(R) stents of infringing the Palmaz patent that
expired in November 2005. The Liberte(R) stent was also
accused of infringing Cordis' Gray patent that expires
in 2016. In June 2005, a jury found that the
Express2TM, Taxus(R) and Liberte(R) stents infringed the
Palmaz patent and that the Liberte(R) stent also
infringed the Gray patent. Boston Scientific has
appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit.

PATENT LITIGATION AGAINST VARIOUS JOHNSON & JOHNSON
SUBSIDIARIES

The products of various Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries
are the subject of various patent lawsuits, the
outcomes of which could potentially adversely affect
the ability of those subsidiaries to sell those
products, or require the payment of past damages and
future royalties.

In July 2005, a jury in Federal District Court in
Delaware found that the Cordis CYPHER(R) stent infringed
Boston Scientific's Ding '536 patent and that the
Cordis CYPHER(R) and BX VELOCITY(R) stents also infringed
Boston Scientific's Jang '021 patent. The jury also
found both of those patents valid. Boston Scientific
seeks substantial damages and an injunction in that
action. The District Court denied motions by Cordis to
overturn the jury verdicts or grant a new trial. Cordis
has appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit. The District Court indicated it will consider
damages, willfulness and injunctive relief after the
appeals have been decided.

Boston Scientific has brought actions in Belgium, the
Netherlands and Germany under its Kastenhofer patent,
which purports to cover two layer catheters such as
those used to deliver the Cypher Stent, to enjoin the
manufacture and sale of allegedly infringing catheters
in those countries, and to recover damages. The hearing
in the Belgian case took place in  September 2007.  A
decision by the lower court in the Netherlands in
Boston Scientific's favor was reversed on appeal in
April 2007.  Boston Scientific has filed an appeal to
the Dutch Supreme Court. In October 2007, Boston
Scientific prevailed in the nullity action challenging
the validity of the Kastenhofer patent filed by Cordis
in Germany.

Trial in Boston Scientific's U.S. case based on the
Kastenhofer patent concluded in Federal Court in
California on October 31, 2007, with a jury verdict in
favor of Cordis. The jury found the Kastenhofer patent
invalid and found for Cordis with respect to
infringement of the patent asserted by Cordis in its
counterclaim. Post trial motions and appeals are
anticipated.

In Germany, Boston Scientific has several actions based
on its Ding patents pending against the Cordis CYPHER(R)
stent. Cordis was successful in these actions at the
trial level, but Boston Scientific has appealed.

The following chart summarizes various patent lawsuits
concerning products of Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries

LITIGATION  AGAINST  FILERS  OF  ABBREVIATED  NEW  DRUG
APPLICATIONS (ANDA)

The following chart indicates lawsuits pending against
generic firms that filed Abbreviated New Drug
Applications seeking to market generic forms of
products sold by various subsidiaries of
the Company prior to expiration of the applicable
patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically
include allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and
unenforceability of these patents. In the event the
subsidiary of the Company involved is not successful in
these actions, or the statutory 30-month stay expires
before a ruling from the district court is obtained,
the firms involved will have the ability, upon FDA
approval, to introduce generic versions of the product
at issue resulting in very substantial market share and
revenue losses for the product of the Company's
subsidiary.

As noted in the following chart, 30-month stays expired
during 2006 and will expire in 2007 or 2008 with
respect to ANDA challenges regarding various products:

Trial in the action against Teva, Dr. Reddy's and Mylan
with respect to their ANDA challenges to the patent on
ACIPHEX(R) of Eisai Inc., Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical's
marketing partner, proceeded before the district court
in New York in March 2007.  On May 11, 2007, the Court
held that the ACIPHEX(R) compound patent is enforceable.
The Court had previously held that the patent is valid.
Teva, Dr. Reddy's and Mylan have appealed both
decisions to the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit.

In the action against Mylan and Dr. Reddy's
Laboratories regarding RISPERDAL(R) (risperidone) tablets
and M-Tabs, the District Court in New Jersey ruled, on
October 13, 2006, that the RISPERDAL(R) patent was valid,
enforceable, and infringed by the generic products at
issue, and entered an injunction prohibiting Mylan and
Dr. Reddy's from marketing their generic risperidone
products until a date no earlier than patent expiration
in December 2007. Mylan appealed that ruling.  On May
11, 2007, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District
Court's judgment of patent validity and enforceability.
Mylan did not seek further review of the decision and
this matter is concluded.

In the action against Apotex regarding RISPERDAL(R)
(risperidone) tablets, the District Court in New Jersey
entered judgment for Janssen on October 2, 2007,
pursuant to Apotex's stipulation to be bound by the
outcome of the Mylan litigation. On October 12, 2007,
the court also dismissed a second suit relating to the
Oral Solution in which Apotex challenged the validity
and infringement of two patents relating to
formulations for an oral solution product. Apotex
appealed this decision on October 19, 2007.

In the actions against Mylan with respect to the patent
on TOPAMAX(R), the District Court in New Jersey, on
October 24, 2006, granted the motion of the Company's
subsidiary Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Ortho-
McNeil) for a preliminary injunction barring launch by
Mylan of its generic versions of TOPAMAX(R). On
February 2, 2007, the District Court granted Ortho-
McNeil's motion for summary judgment dismissing Mylan's
claim the patent was obvious, the only remaining issue
in the case. The Court entered judgment in the case for
Ortho-McNeil, and entered an injunction prohibiting
Mylan from marketing its generic topiramate products
until a date no earlier than patent expiration in
September 2008.  Mylan has appealed this ruling.  On
April 2, 2007, the District Court entered judgment
against Cobalt pursuant to its stipulation to be bound
by the outcome in the Mylan suit.  Cobalt appealed this
ruling. The Court of Appeals will hear argument on both
appeals on November 9, 2007.

In the action against Perrigo regarding a patent for
PEPCID COMPLETE(R), the District Court for the Southern
District of New York, on June 5, 2007, held that the
patent was invalid as obvious.  The Company's
subsidiary McNEIL-PPC, Inc. has appealed the decision
with its partners, Merck & Co., Inc., and Johnson &
Johnson*Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co.

In the action against Barr and AlphaPharm with respect
to their ANDA challenges to the RAZADYNE(R) patent that
Janssen licenses from Synaptech, Inc., a four-day non-
jury trial was held in the District Court in Delaware
in May 2007.  The Court has yet to issue its ruling in
that action.

In the weeks following the adverse ruling in the
DITROPAN XL(R) ANDA litigation against Mylan in September
2005, Johnson & Johnson and ALZA received seven
antitrust class action complaints filed by purchasers
of the product. They allege that Johnson & Johnson and
ALZA violated federal and state antitrust laws by
knowingly pursuing baseless patent litigation, and
thereby delaying entry into the market by Mylan and
Impax.


AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICE (AWP) LITIGATION

Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical
subsidiaries, along with numerous other pharmaceutical
companies, are defendants in a series of lawsuits in
state and federal courts involving allegations that the
pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical
products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise
actionable conduct because, among other things, the
companies allegedly reported an inflated Average
Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Most of
these cases, both federal actions and state actions
removed to federal court, have been consolidated for
pre-trial purposes in a Multi-District Litigation (MDL)
in Federal District Court in Boston, Massachusetts. The
plaintiffs in these cases include classes of private
persons or entities that paid for any portion of the
purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state
government entities that made Medicaid payments for the
drugs at issue based on AWP.

The MDL Court identified classes of Massachusetts-only
private insurers providing "Medi-gap" insurance
coverage and private payers for physician-administered
drugs where payments were based on AWP ("Class 2" and
"Class 3"), and a national class of individuals who
made co-payments for physician-administered drugs
covered by Medicare ("Class 1"). A trial of the two
Massachusetts-only class actions concluded before the
MDL Court in December 2006. On June 21, 2007, the MDL
Court issued post-trial rulings, dismissing the Johnson
& Johnson defendants from the case regarding all claims
of Classes 2 and 3.  The MDL Court subsequently
indicated it would dismiss against the Johnson &
Johnson defendants all claims by the Class 1 plaintiffs
as well. Trial in the action brought by the Attorney
General of the State of Alabama making allegations
related to AWP is set for the first quarter of 2008.
Additional AWP cases brought by various Attorneys
General are expected to be set for trial in 2008.

resolved by DePuy and the four other leading suppliers
of hip and knee implants in late September 2007 by
agreements with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the
District of New Jersey.  The settlements include an 18-
month Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA), acceptance

REMICADE(R) under the company's Contract Purchase
Program. Centocor produced material responsive to the
subpoena. Centocor has been advised that this
investigation has been closed.

In February 2007, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily
disclosed to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that
subsidiaries outside the United States are believed to
have made improper payments in connection with the sale
of medical devices in two small-market countries, which
payments may fall within the jurisdiction of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). In the course of
continuing dialogues with the agencies, other issues
potentially rising to the level of FCPA violations in
additional markets have been brought to the attention
of the agencies by the Company.  The Company has
provided and will continue to provide additional
information to DOJ and SEC, and will cooperate with the
agencies' reviews of these matters.

On March 5, 2007, Cordis Corporation received a letter
request for documents from the Committee on Oversight
and Government Reform of the U.S. House of
Representatives regarding marketing and safety of drug-
eluting stents.  Cordis is cooperating in responding to
the request.

On March 12, 2007, the Company announced that it had
received separate subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's
Office in Philadelphia, the U.S. Attorney's Office in
Boston and the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco.
The subpoenas relate to investigations by these three
offices referenced above concerning, respectively,
sales and marketing of RISPERDAL(R) by Janssen, TOPAMAX(R)
by Ortho-McNeil and NATRECOR(R) by Scios.  The subpoenas
request information regarding the Company's corporate
supervision and oversight of these three subsidiaries,

On March 21, 2007, the Company received a letter from
the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the U.S. House
of Representatives seeking answers to several questions
regarding marketing and safety of PROCRIT(R), the
erythropoietin product sold by the Company's Ortho-
Biotech subsidiary.   On May 30, 2007, Senator
Grassley, the ranking member of the United States
Senate Committee on Finance, sent the Company a letter
seeking information relating to PROCRIT(R).  Although
there are some differences between the two letters, the
Senate request in large measure overlaps the House
request. The Company provided its initial response on
July 9, 2007.  On May 10, 2007, the New York State
Attorney General issued a subpoena seeking information
relating to PROCRIT(R).  Like the House and Senate
requests, the subpoena asks for materials relating to
PROCRIT(R) safety, marketing and pricing.  The Company is
responding to these requests.

On April 27, 2007, the Company received two subpoenas
from the Office of the Attorney General of the State of
Delaware.  The subpoenas seek documents and information
relating to nominal pricing agreements.  For purposes
of the subpoenas, nominal pricing agreements are
defined as agreements under which the Company agreed to
provide a pharmaceutical product for less than ten
percent of the Average Manufacturer Price for the
product.  The Company is responding to the subpoenas
and will cooperate with the inquiry.

In September 2004, plaintiffs in an employment
discrimination litigation initiated against the Company
in 2001 in Federal District Court in New Jersey moved
to certify a class of all African American and Hispanic
salaried employees of the Company and its affiliates in
the U.S., who were employed at any time from November
1997 to the present. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages
for the period 1997 through the present (including
punitive damages) and equitable relief. The Court
denied plaintiffs' class certification motion in
December 2006 and their motion for reconsideration in
April 2007. Plaintiffs are seeking to appeal these
decisions.

In late December 2005 and early 2006, three purported
class actions were filed on behalf of purchasers of
endo-mechanical instruments against the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, Ethicon, Inc., Ethicon Endo-
Surgery, Inc., and Johnson & Johnson Health Care
Systems, Inc. These challenge suture and endo-
mechanical contracts with Group Purchasing
Organizations and hospitals, in which discounts are
predicated on a hospital achieving specified market
share targets for both categories of products. These
actions have been filed in the Federal District Court
for the Central District of California.

In November 2005, Amgen filed suit against Hoffmann-
LaRoche, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration that
the Roche product CERA, which Roche has indicated it
will seek to introduce into the United States,
infringes a number of Amgen patents concerning EPO.
Amgen licenses  EPO for sale in the United States to
the Company's Ortho Biotech Inc. subsidiary for non-
dialysis indications. Trial in this action  concluded
in October with a verdict in Amgen's favor. Roche is
expected to appeal.

In October 2006, Wyeth, Inc. initiated litigation in
Delaware against Cordis Corporation alleging that
Cordis breached the license and supply agreement
pursuant to which Wyeth supplies Cordis the drug
Rapamycin which is used in connection with Cordis'
CYPHER(R) Sirolimus-eluting Stent. Cordis has commenced
its own action in Delaware seeking a declaration that
no breach has occurred.

With respect to all the above matters, the Company and
its subsidiaries are vigorously contesting the
allegations asserted against them and otherwise
pursuing defenses to maximize the prospect of success.
The Company and its subsidiaries involved in these
matters continually evaluate their strategies in
managing these matters and, where appropriate, pursue
settlements and other resolutions where those are in
the best interest of the Company.

The Company is also involved in a number of other
patent, trademark and other lawsuits incidental to its
business. The ultimate legal and financial liability of
the Company in respect to all claims, lawsuits and
proceedings referred to above cannot be estimated with
any certainty. However, in the Company's opinion, based
on its examination of these matters, its experience to
date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome
of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the
Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial
position, although the resolution in any reporting
period of one or more of these matters could have a
significant impact on the Company's results of
operations and cash flows for that period.



NOTE 13 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT

Sterling due in 2024 and approximately $1.5 billion of
4.75% Notes issued in Euro currency due in 2019. The
proceeds of the notes are expected to be used for
general corporate purposes including the repayment of
a portion of the outstanding commerical paper, issued

The  OTC  Pharmaceuticals  and  Nutritionals  franchise
achieved   operational  growth  of  78.6%.   This   was
attributable to new products from acquisitions, as well
as  growth  for adult analgesics and SPLENDA(R)  products.
These  gains  were partially offset by lower  sales  of
upper respiratory products. The 2006 OTC Pharmaceutical
and Nutritionals franchise sales included the impact of
the re-launch of the TYLENOL(R) Upper Respiratory product
line with products containing phenylephrine instead  of
pseudoephedrine. The impact on OTC Pharmaceuticals  and
Nutritionals total sales growth and operational  growth
due to newly acquired brands from Pfizer Inc. was 77.4%
in the fiscal third quarter of 2007.

On  October 11, 2007 The Company announced a  voluntary
withdrawal of infants' cough and cold products from the
market.  When  used as directed, these  medicines  have
been   generally  recognized  as  safe  and  effective.
However, an assessment of available data on the use  of
pediatric cough and cold medicines has identified  rare
instances  of  misuse leading to overdose, particularly
in  infants  under  two years of age.  As  well,  these
products  along with children's cough and cold products
generally   were   the  subject   of   a   recent   FDA
Nonprescription Drug Advisory Committee hearing,  which
recommended to the FDA certain changes in the marketing
and sale of such products. This is not expected to have
a   significant   impact   on   sales   for   the   OTC
Pharmaceuticals and Nutritionals franchise.

The Skin Care franchise operational growth of 11.8% was
driven  by  strong  performances from  the  NEUTROGENA(R),
CLEAN  AND CLEAR(R) and AVEENO(R) product lines as well
as new products related to acquisitions. The impact on
Skin Care total sales growth and operational growth due
to  newly acquired brands from Pfizer Inc. was 5.1%  in
the fiscal third quarter of 2007.

The  Baby  & Kids Care franchise operational growth  of
7.3%  was  the  result  of the strong  performances  of
cleansers  and powders. The impact on Baby & Kids  Care
total  sales growth and operational growth due to newly
acquired  brands  from  Pfizer  Inc.  and  divestitures
related to the acquisition was 1.7% in the fiscal third
quarter of 2007.

The   Women's  Health  franchise  achieved  operational
growth  of  1.5%.  The impact on Women's  Health  total
sales  growth  and  operational  growth  due  to  newly
acquired brands from Pfizer Inc. was 4.6% in the fiscal
third  quarter  of  2007.  Net  of  sales  related   to
acquisitions  there was an operational decline  due  to
increased competition.

The   Oral   Care  franchise  operational  growth   was
attributable  to  new  products from  acquisitions  and
newly  launched products, such as LISTERINE(R) mouthwashes
and  dissolvable whitening strips. The impact  on  Oral
Care  total sales growth and operational growth due  to
newly acquired brands from Pfizer Inc. and divestitures
related to the acquisition was greater than 100%.


Pharmaceutical
Pharmaceutical segment sales in the first  fiscal  nine
months of 2007 were $18.5 billion, a total increase  of
6.7%  over the same period a year ago with 4.5% of this
change due to operational increases and a 2.2% increase
related  to the positive impact of currency.  The  U.S.
Pharmaceutical sales increase was 3.9%  and  the  total
growth in international Pharmaceutical sales was 11.8%,
with  5.6%  of this change due to operational increases
and the remaining 6.2% increase related to the positive
impact of currency.

2.5%  increase  related  to  the  positive  impact   of
currency.  Pharmaceutical sales in the U.S. experienced
a  decrease  of 2.0% while international Pharmaceutical
sales achieved an increase of 14.4%, with 7.2% of  this
change  due to operational increases and the  remaining
7.2%  increase  related  to  the  positive  impact   of
currency.

Sales  growth  within the segment  was  led  by  strong
performances  from  RISPERDAL(R)  CONSTA(R)  (risperidone),
TOPAMAX(R) (topiramate) and LEVAQUIN(R). Generic competition
related  to  DURAGESIC(R) (fentanyl transdermal  system),
DITROPAN(R), SPORANOX(R) (itraconazole), RISPERDAL(R) oral and
hormonal contraceptives continued to negatively  impact
sales  during the fiscal third quarter of 2007.   Sales
results  in both the fiscal third quarter of  2007  and
2006  benefited from one-time adjustments.  The  fiscal
third  quarter  of 2007 included a reduction  to  sales
rebate  reserves of approximately $60 million versus  a
reduction  of approximately $130 million in the  fiscal
third quarter of 2006.

The  anti-psychotic franchise which includes RISPERDAL(R)
oral  (risperidone),  a  medication  that  treats   the
symptoms   of   schizophrenia,   bipolar   mania    and
irritability  associated  with  autistic  behavior   in
indicated patients, RISPERDAL(R) CONSTA(R) (risperidone)  a
long   acting   injectable  and  INVEGA(TM)  (paliperdone)
Extended-Release   tablets   for   the   treatment   of
schizophrenia, achieved operational growth of  6.0%  in
the  fiscal  third quarter of 2007.  Sales  growth  was
positively impacted by the continued global success  of
RISPERDAL(R) CONSTA(R)  The patent  for the  RISPERDAL(R)
compound will expire in the U.S. and most major markets
outside  the U.S. by December 2007. In March, the  U.S.
Food  and  Drug Administration (FDA) granted  pediatric
exclusivity for RISPERDAL(R), which extends the marketing
exclusivity in the U.S. for RISPERDAL(R) oral to the  end
of  June  2008.  In 2006 Worldwide sales of  RISPERDAL(R)
oral  were  $3.3  billion  and  U.S.  sales  were  $2.1
billion.  The expiration of the RISPERDAL(R) oral  patent
will result in a significant reduction in sales in  the
U.S.

REMICADE(R)  (infliximab), a biologic  approved  for  the
treatment  of  Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis,
psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis  and
use  in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, achieved
operational growth of 5.5% over prior year fiscal third
quarter.  This continued growth was driven by increased
demand  due to expanded indications and overall  market
growth.  During  the  fiscal second  quarter  of  2007,
REMICADE(R)   received   approval   from   the   European
Commission  (EU)  for  the  pediatric  Crohn's  disease
indications.  REMICADE(R) is competing in a market  which
is experiencing increased competition.

PROCRIT(R)  (Epoetin  alfa)  and  EPREX(R)  (Epoetin  alfa)
combined had an operational sales decline of 17.4%,  as
compared to prior year fiscal third quarter. EPREX(R)  as
it  is  known  outside  the U.S.  achieved  operational
growth  of  1.0% while PROCRIT(R) as it is known  in  the
U.S.  market  experienced  an  operational  decline  of
27.1%.  The decline was primarily due to the  declining
market  of  Erythropoiesis  Stimulating  Agents  (ESAs)
partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  the  Company's
overall  market share as compared to prior year  fiscal
third  quarter.  On  July  30,  2007  The  Centers  for
Medicare  and Medicaid (CMS) issued a National Coverage
Determination  (NCD),  which significantly  limits  the
future reimbursement of ESAs in oncology in the U.S. In
the  U.S., Epoetin alfa products are subject to a label
change,  which may negatively impact future sales.  The
label for Epoetin alfa products is also under review in
jurisdictions outside the U.S.

TOPAMAX(R) (topiramate), which  has  been  approved  for
adjunctive and monotherapy use in epilepsy, as well  as
for  the  prophylactic treatment of migraines, achieved
strong  operational  growth of 13.6%  over  prior  year
fiscal  third  quarter. The major  contributor  to  the
growth  was  the  continued  success  in  the  migraine
category.  This was partially offset by the  impact  of
the  one-time reduction adjustment to the  reserve  for
sales  rebates recorded in the fiscal third quarter  of
2006. The patent for TOPAMAX(R) (topiramate) in the  U.S.
will  expire  in  September 2008. The  TOPAMAX(R)  patent
carries the possibility of a pediatric extension in the
U.S., which if obtained, would grant market exclusivity
in  the U.S. until March 2009. The Company is on target
to  file for the pediatric extension. In 2006 Worldwide
sales of TOPAMAX(R) were $2.0 billion and U.S. sales were
$1.6  billion.  The expiration of a product  patent  or
loss  of market exclusivity can result in a significant
reduction in sales.

LEVAQUIN(R) (levofloxacin)/FLOXIN(R) achieved operational
growth  of  6.8% over prior year fiscal third  quarter.
This  was primarily due to favorable market growth.  In
March the FDA granted pediatric exclusivity in the U.S.
for   LEVAQUIN(R)   which  will  extend   the   marketing
exclusivity by six months to June 2011.

ACIPHEX(R)/PARIET(R) a  proton  pump inhibitor, achieved
operational  growth of 6.1% as compared to  prior  year
fiscal third quarter.

DURAGESIC(R)/Fentanyl  Transdermal (fentanyl  transdermal
system)  experienced an operational  sales  decline  of
13.2%  compared  to  prior year fiscal  third  quarter,
primarily due to continued generic erosion.

The  hormonal  contraceptive franchise  experienced  an
operational  sales decline of 15.6% compared  to  prior
year  fiscal  third  quarter primarily  resulting  from
branded and generic competition in oral contraceptives.
ORTHO EVRA(R)(norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol), the first
contraceptive patch approved by the FDA, experienced  a
decline  in  sales as a result of labeling changes  and
negative media coverage concerning product safety.

CONCERTA(R) (methylphenidate HCl), a product for the
treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
achieved operational sales growth of 3.6% over the
fiscal third quarter of 2006. Sales in the U.S. were
down slightly due to lower market share partially
offset by market growth, while all regions outside the
U.S. achieved strong operational growth. Although the
original CONCERTA(R) patent expired in 2004, the FDA has
not approved any generic version that is substitutable
for CONCERTA(R) Two parties have filed Abbreviated New
Drug Applications (ANDAs) for generic versions of
CONCERTA(R), which are pending and may be approved at any
time.

NATRECOR(R) (nesiritide), a product for the treatment  of
patients  with  acutely decompensated congestive  heart
failure  who  have  dyspnea at  rest  or  with  minimal
activity,  continues to experience a decline in  demand
due   to  negative  media  coverage  regarding  a  meta
analysis  of  selected historical clinical trials.  The
Company  believes  that  the full  data  set  does  not
support  the conclusions of these medical and  consumer
publications  and  the  currently  approved  label  for
NATRECOR(R) reflects all available data to date.

NATRECOR(R)  was  purchased by the Company  in  2003  and
resulted in the recording of an intangible asset, which
is   being  amortized  over  12  years.  The  remaining
unamortized intangible value associated with  NATRECOR(R)
was $0.9 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter
of 2007, and based on the current estimate of projected
future  cash  flows, no adjustment to  this  intangible
asset is required.


Medical Devices and Diagnostics
Medical  Devices and Diagnostics segment sales  in  the
first fiscal nine months of 2007 were $16.0 billion, an
increase of 5.8% over the same period a year ago,  with
3.2%  of  this change due to operational increases  and
the  remaining  2.6% increase related to  the  positive
impact  of  currency.   The U.S.  Medical  Devices  and
Diagnostics sales increase was 2.0% and the  growth  in
international Medical Devices and Diagnostics sales was
9.6%, which included operational increases of 4.3%  and
an  increase of 5.3% related to the positive impact  of
currency.

The DePuy franchise achieved operational growth of 8.8%
over   prior  year  fiscal  third  quarter.  This   was
primarily    due    to   DePuy's   orthopaedic    joint
reconstruction  products including  the  hip  and  knee
product lines. Strong performance was also achieved  in
Mitek sports medicine products.

The Ethicon Endo-Surgery franchise achieved operational
growth of 8.3% over prior year fiscal third quarter.  A
major  contributor of growth continues to be endocutter
sales,   which  include  products  used  in  performing
bariatric  procedures for the treatment of obesity,  an
important focus area for the franchise.  Strong results
were  achieved  with  the  continued  success  of   the
HARMONIC   SCALPEL(R),   an   ultrasonic   cutting    and
coagulating surgical device.

Ethicon worldwide sales grew operationally by 5.7% from
the  same  period  in  the prior year,  resulting  from
growth in the hemostasis, women's health, biosurgicals,
and the mesh product lines.

The  Cordis franchise experienced an operational  sales
decline of 23.1% over the fiscal third quarter of 2006.
This  decline was caused by lower sales of the  CYPHER(R)
Sirolimus-eluting  Stent due to  increased  competition
outside  the U.S. as well as the global contraction  of
the  drug-eluting stent market following reports  of  a
potential risk of late stent thrombosis associated with
the  use  of  drug-eluting stents. These  results  were
partially offset by strong performance by the  Biosense
Webster and neurovascular businesses.

On  June 13, 2007 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)  notified Cordis that all items outlined  in  the
Warning  Letters  received  in  April  and  July   2004
regarding  Good Manufacturing Practice regulations  and
Good Clinical Practice regulations have been resolved.

The  LifeScan franchise achieved operational growth  of
12.5%  over the fiscal third quarter of 2006 reflecting
the  continued success of the ULTRA(R) product  lines.  An
additional  contributor was the growth  of  the  Animas
business  due  to the launch of the 2020  insulin  pump
earlier this year.

The  Vision Care franchise operational sales growth  of
15.5%  was led by the global success of ACUVUE(R) OASYS(TM),
ACUVUE(R)  ADVANCE(TM) Brand Contact Lenses for  ASTIGMATISM
and 1-DAY ACUVUE(R) MOIST(TM).

The   Ortho-Clinical  Diagnostics  franchise   achieved
operational growth of 9.5% over prior year fiscal third
quarter. The Immunodiagnostic product line was a  major
contributor  in  the  U.S., as well  as  the  continued
growth of the Chagas screening assay in the U.S.

Cost of Products Sold
Consolidated  costs  of products  sold  for  the  first
fiscal  nine  months of 2007 increased  to  28.8%  from
27.9%  of  sales over the same period a year ago.   The
cost  of products sold for the fiscal third quarter  of
2007  increased  to 28.5% from 27.5% of  sales  in  the
fiscal   third  quarter  of  2006.  The  increase   was
primarily due to the impact of newly acquired  consumer
brands.


Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses
Consolidated   selling,  marketing  and  administrative
expenses  for  the  first fiscal nine  months  of  2007
increased  0.5%  over  the  same  period  a  year  ago.
Consolidated   selling,  marketing  and  administrative
expenses  as  a percent to sales for the  first  fiscal
nine  months  of 2007 were 32.6% versus 32.1%  for  the
same   period   a  year  ago.   Consolidated   selling,
marketing  and administrative expenses for  the  fiscal
third  quarter  of 2007 increased 0.4%  over  the  same
period a year ago.  As a percent to sales, consolidated
selling,  marketing  and administrative  expenses  were
32.7%  versus  32.3% for the same period  a  year  ago.
Increases in the quarterly and nine month periods  were
attributable  to  the addition of  the  newly  acquired
consumer  brands  to  the mix of  businesses  partially
offset  by  continued cost containment  efforts  across
many of the Company's businesses.


Research & Development
Research activities represent a significant part of the
Company's business.  These expenditures relate  to  the
development  of new products, improvement  of  existing
products,  technical support of products and compliance
with governmental regulations for the protection of the
consumer.  Worldwide costs of research activities,  for
the   first  fiscal  nine  months  of  2007  were  $5.3
billion,  an  increase of 5.4% over the same  period  a
year  ago.    Research and development spending in  the
fiscal  third  quarter  of 2007 was  $1.8  billion,  an
increase of 6.7% over the fiscal third quarter of 2006.
Research and development spending as a percent to sales
for  the  first  fiscal nine months of 2007  was  11.9%
versus  12.8%  for  the same period  a  year  ago.  The
decrease was primarily due to the inclusion in 2006  of
the   $165   million   up  front  payment   to   Vertex
Pharmaceuticals   for  the  rights   to   develop   and
commercialize  VX-950  for  Hepatitis  C  in   selected
regions, including Europe and the change in the mix  of
businesses  with  the inclusion of the  newly  acquired
consumer  products. Research and development  spending,
as  a percent to sales for the fiscal third quarter  of
2007  was 12.3% versus 12.9% for the same period a year
ago.  This decrease was primarily due to the change  in
the  mix of businesses with the inclusion of the  newly
acquired consumer products.




Restructuring
On July 31, 2007 the Company announced initiatives that
are expected to generate pre-tax, annual cost savings
of $1.3-$1.6 billion for 2008 in an effort to improve
its overall cost structure. During the fiscal third
quarter of 2007, the Company recorded $745 million in
pre-tax charges See note 11 for more details.

In-Process Research & Development(IPR&D)
In the fiscal third quarter of 2007, the Company had no
IPR&D charges. IPR&D charges of $807 million before and
after tax were recorded during the first fiscal nine
months of 2007 related to the acquisition of Conor
Medsystems Inc.

In the fiscal third quarter of 2006, the Company
recorded IPR&D charges of $115 million before tax, with
no tax benefit, related to the acquisitions of Ensure
Medical, Inc. and Colbar LifeScience Ltd.  IPR&D
charges of $239 million before tax and $231 million
after tax were recorded during the first fiscal nine
months of 2006 related to the acquisitions of Vascular
Control Systems, Inc., Hand Innovations LLC, Future
Medical Systems S.A. and the third quarter acquisitions
mentioned above.


Other (Income) Expense, Net
Other   (income) expense, net includes gains and losses
related  to  the sale and write-down of certain  equity
securities   of  the  Johnson  &  Johnson   Development
Corporation, gains and losses on the disposal of  fixed
assets,  currency gains and losses, minority interests,
litigation  settlements,  as well  as  royalty  income.
The favorable change in other (income) expense, net for
the  fiscal  third quarter of 2007 as compared  to  the
same  period  a year ago was due to additional  product
liability reserves recorded in 2006 partially offset by
the  2007  payment  for an orthopaedics  industry  wide
settlement  to the U.S. Attorney's office, District  of
New  Jersey.  The unfavorable change in other  (income)
expense, net for the first fiscal nine months  of  2007
as  compared  to the same period a year  ago  was  $428
million. This was primarily due to the net gain of $175
million  before  tax  related  to  the  divestiture  of
certain brands recorded in the fiscal first quarter  of
2007,  as compared to the same period a year ago, which
included  a  gain  of  $622 million  recorded  for  the
Guidant  acquisition  agreement termination  fee,  less
associated expenses.

OPERATING PROFIT BY SEGMENT
Consumer Segment
Operating profit for the Consumer segment as a  percent
to  sales  in the first fiscal nine months of 2007  was
17.1%  versus 18.9% over the same period  a  year  ago.
Operating  profit as a percent to sales in  the  fiscal
third  quarter of 2007 was 16.2% versus 18.5% over  the
same  period  a  year ago. The primary  driver  of  the
decrease in the operating profit margin in the Consumer
segment for both periods in 2007 over the same period a
year  ago  was related to integration costs  and  other
operating expenses related to newly acquired products.




Pharmaceutical Segment
Operating  profit for the Pharmaceutical segment  as  a
percent  to  sales in the first fiscal nine  months  of
2007 was 32.5% versus 31.4% over the same period a year
ago.   Operating profit as a percent to  sales  in  the
fiscal  third  quarter of 2007 was 26.1%  versus  30.8%
over  the  same  period  a year ago.  Operating  profit
margin improved in the first fiscal nine months of 2007
as compared to the same period a year ago. This was due
to  the  inclusion of the $165 million up front payment
to Vertex Pharmaceuticals for the rights to develop and
commercialize  VX-950  for  Hepatitis  C  in   selected
regions  in  the fiscal nine months of 2006.  Operating
profit margin for the fiscal third quarter of 2007  was
unfavorable versus the same period a year  ago  due  to
the  restructuring  charges of  $429  million  recorded
during the fiscal third quarter of 2007.

Medical Devices and Diagnostics Segment
Operating   profit   for  the   Medical   Devices   and
Diagnostics segment as a percent to sales in the  first
fiscal nine months of 2007 was 21.1% versus 32.6%  over
the  same  period  a year ago. Operating  profit  as  a
percent  to sales in the fiscal third quarter  of  2007
was 21.7% versus 27.1% over the same period a year ago.
The  decline  in  the operating profit  margin  in  the
Medical  Devices  and  Diagnostics  segment  for   both
periods  in 2007 versus the same period a year ago  was
due  to  the  restructuring  charges  of  $301  million
recorded  during the fiscal third quarter of  2007  and
unfavorable    product   mix   within   the    segment.
Additionally,  the  first fiscal nine  months  of  2007
included  acquisition  related IPR&D  charges  of  $807
million  versus $239 million a year ago  and  the  gain
associated  with  the  Guidant  acquisition   agreement
termination  fee,  less associated  expenses,  of  $622
million  before tax recorded in the first  fiscal  nine
months of 2006.

Interest (Income) Expense
Interest income decreased in both the first fiscal nine
months and fiscal third quarter of 2007 as compared  to
the  same  periods  a year ago.  The cash  balance  and
marketable securities, was $8.3 billion at the  end  of
the  fiscal third quarter of 2007.  This was a decrease
of  $6.4  billion from the same period a year ago.  The
decline  in  the  cash  balance was  primarily  due  to
acquisition  activity and the stock repurchase  program
during the fiscal year 2007.

Interest  expense  increased in both the  first  fiscal
nine  months  and  fiscal  third  quarter  of  2007  as
compared to the same periods a year ago, resulting from
a  higher  debt  position. This was due to  acquisition
activity  and the stock repurchase programs during  the
fiscal year 2007 and 2006.

Provision For Taxes on Income
The  worldwide effective income tax rates for the first
fiscal  nine  months of 2007 and 2006  were  25.1%  and
25.2%,  respectively,  a decrease  of  0.1%.  This  was
primarily due to increases in taxable income  in  lower
tax  jurisdictions relative to taxable income in higher
tax  jurisdictions  and  the Research  and  Development
(R&D)  tax credit, which was not in effect in the first
fiscal  nine months of 2006. This was partially  offset
by  higher  IPR&D charges  recorded in the fiscal  nine
months  of  2007  versus 2006, which was non-deductible
for  tax  purposes. The tax rate for the  first  fiscal
nine  months  of  2006 benefited  from  a  reversal  of
deferred  tax  valuation  allowances  of  $134  million
associated with the Tibotec business.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash Flows
Cash  generated  from  operations  provided  the  major
sources  of  funds  for  the growth  of  the  business,
including  working  capital, capital  expenditures  and
acquisitions.   Other  uses  of  cash  included   share
repurchases  and  dividends. In the first  fiscal  nine
months  of  2007, cash flow from operations  was  $10.9
billion,  an  increase of $1.0 billion  over  the  same
period  a  year  ago. The major changes in  assets  and
liabilities  were a $1.3 billion increase  in  accounts
payable  and accrued liabilities, $0.4 billion increase
in other current and non-current liabilities and a $0.3
decrease in the accounts receivable. This was partially
offset by a $1.1 billion increase in other current  and
non-current   assets.  Net  cash  used   by   investing
activities increased by $1.5 billion primarily due to a
$1.6  billion  net  increase in  the  purchase/sale  of
marketable  securities.  Net  cash  used  by  financing
activities decreased by $4.6 billion primarily due to a
$2.8 billion decrease in the repurchase of common stock
and  a $2.6 billion increase in proceeds from long-term
debt partially offset by the net retirement/proceeds of
short term debt. There was also a $0.3 billion increase
in  dividends to shareholders in 2007. Cash and current
marketable securities were $8.3 billion at the  end  of
the fiscal third quarter of 2007 as compared with $14.7
billion  at  fiscal third quarter of 2006. This  change
was  primarily due to acquisition activity in  December
of 2006 and the 2007 stock repurchase program.

On July 9, 2007, the Company announced that its Board
of Directors approved a stock repurchase program,
authorizing the Company to buy back up to $10 billion
of the Company's common stock.  Share repurchases will
take place on the open market from time to time based
on market conditions.  The repurchase program has no
time limit and may be suspended for periods or
discontinued at any time.  Any shares acquired will be
available for general corporate purposes.  The Company
intends to fund the share repurchase program through a
combination of available cash and debt. The Company
does not expect its triple-A credit rating to be
effected by the share repurchase program.

On August 15, 2007 the Company issued an aggregate of
$2.6 billion in long-term notes. There are $0.6 billion
of 5.150% Notes due in 2012, $1.0 billion of 5.550%
Notes due in 2017 and $1.0 billion of 5.950% Notes due
in 2037. The  proceeds  of  the notes are expected to
be used for general corporate purposes including the
repayment of a portion of the outstanding commercial
paper, issued to fund the Pfizer Consumer Healthcare
acquisition.


Dividends

On  July  16, 2007, the Board of Directors  declared  a
regular  cash dividend of $0.415 per share,  which  was
paid on September 11, 2007 to shareholders of record as
of August 28, 2007.

On October 18, 2007, the Board of Directors declared  a
regular  cash dividend of $0.415 per share, payable  on
December  11,  2007 to shareholders  of  record  as  of
November 27, 2007.

The  Company expects to continue the practice of paying
regular cash dividends.

OTHER INFORMATION
New Accounting Standards
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No 157, Fair Value Measurements.  This
statement defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value under generally accepted
accounting principles, and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements.  The statement is effective in
the fiscal first quarter of 2008 and the Company will
adopt the statement at that time.  The Company believes
that the adoption of SFAS No 157 will not have a
material effect on its results of operations, cash
flows or financial position.

In  February 2007, the FASB issued Statement  No.  159,
Fair  Value  Option for Financial Assets and  Financial
Liabilities, which permits an entity to measure certain
financial  assets  and financial  liabilities  at  fair
value. Statement 159 is effective for fiscal year  2008
but  early  adoption  is  permitted.  The  Company   is
currently   in   the   process   of   evaluating   this
pronouncement  and the impact of the adoption  of  FASB
159 would have on its results of operations, cash flows
and financial position.

EITF  Issue 07-3: Accounting for Nonrefundable  Advance
Payments  for  Goods or Services Received  for  Use  in
Future Research and Development Activities. This  Issue
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years  beginning after December 15, 2007. The  adoption
of  EITF  07-3  is not expected to have  a  significant
impact  on  the  Company's results of operations,  cash
flows and financial position.


Economic and Market Factors
Johnson  & Johnson is aware that its products are  used
in  an  environment  where, for  more  than  a  decade,
policymakers,  consumers and businesses have  expressed
concern  about the rising cost of health care.  Johnson
&   Johnson  has  a  long-standing  policy  of  pricing
products responsibly. For the period 1996 through  2006
in  the  United  States, the weighted average  compound
annual growth rate of Johnson & Johnson price increases
for  health  care products (prescription and  over-the-
counter drugs, hospital and professional products)  was
below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Inflation rates, even though moderate in many parts  of
the  world  during 2006, continue to have an effect  on
worldwide  economies  and,  consequently,  on  the  way
companies operate. In the face of increasing costs, the
Company  strives to maintain its profit margins through
cost reduction programs, productivity improvements  and
periodic  price increases.  The Company  faces  various
worldwide  health  care  changes  that  may  result  in
pricing   pressures  that  include  health  care   cost
containment  and  government  legislation  relating  to
sales, promotions and reimbursement.

The   Company   also   operates   in   an   environment
increasingly  hostile to intellectual property  rights.
Generic  drug  firms  have filed Abbreviated  New  Drug
Applications seeking to market generic forms of most of
the  Company's  key pharmaceutical products,  prior  to
expiration  of  the applicable patents  covering  those
products. In the event the Company is not successful in
defending  a lawsuit resulting from an Abbreviated  New
Drug  Application filing, the generic firms  will  then
introduce  generic  versions of the product  at  issue,
resulting in very substantial market share and  revenue
losses.  For further information see the discussion  on
"Litigation  Against  Filers of  Abbreviated  New  Drug
Applications" included in Item 1. Financial  Statements
(unaudited)-    Notes    to   Consolidated    Financial
Statements, Note 12.

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS
This  Form  10-Q  contains forward-looking  statements.
Forward-  looking statements do not relate strictly  to
historical  or  current  facts and  anticipate  results
based  on  management's  plans  that  are  subject   to
uncertainty.   Forward-looking   statements   may    be
identified by the use of words like "plans," "expects,"
"will,"  "anticipates," "estimates" and other words  of
similar  meaning  in  conjunction  with,  among   other
things,  discussions  of future  operations,  financial
performance, the Company's strategy for growth, product
development,  regulatory approval, market position  and
expenditures.

Forward-looking   statements  are  based   on   current
expectations  of  future  events.  The  Company  cannot
guarantee that any forward- looking statement  will  be
accurate,  although the Company believes  that  it  has
been  reasonable  in its expectations and  assumptions.
Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions
prove inaccurate or that unknown risks or uncertainties
materialize, actual results could vary materially  from
the  Company's expectations and projections.  Investors
are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance  on
any  forward-looking statements. The Company  does  not
undertake  to update any forward-looking     statements
as  a  result  of new information or future  events  or
developments.

Risks   and  uncertainties  include  general   industry
conditions  and competition; economic conditions,  such
as   interest   rate   and   currency   exchange   rate
fluctuations; technological advances, new products  and
patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in
new product development, including obtaining regulatory
approvals;  challenges  to patents;  U.S.  and  foreign
health   care   reforms  and  governmental   laws   and
regulations;   trends   toward   health    care    cost
containment;  increased scrutiny  of  the  health  care
industry  by  government agencies; product efficacy  or
safety   concerns  resulting  in  product  recalls   or
regulatory action.

The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2006 contains, as an Exhibit, a
discussion  of  additional  factors  that  could  cause
actual results to differ from expectations. The Company
notes   these  factors  as  permitted  by  the  Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Item 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK

There has been no material change in the Company's
assessment of its sensitivity to market risk since
its presentation set forth in Item  7A,  "Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About  Market Risk," in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2006.

Item 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure controls and procedures.  At the end of  the
period  covered  by this report, the Company  evaluated
the  effectiveness of the design and operation  of  its
disclosure  controls  and  procedures.   The  Company's
disclosure  controls  and procedures  are  designed  to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company  in the reports that it files or submits  under
the  Securities  Exchange Act is  recorded,  processed,
summarized  and  reported,  within  the  time   periods
specified  in  the  SEC's rules and forms.   Disclosure
controls  and  procedures include, without  limitation,
controls   and  procedures  designed  to  ensure   that
information required to be disclosed by the Company  in
the   reports  that  it  files  or  submits  under  the
Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to  the  Company's management, including its  principal
executive and principal financial officers, or  persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate  to  allow
timely   decisions   regarding   required   disclosure.
William   C.  Weldon,  Chairman  and  Chief   Executive
Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Vice President, Finance
and  Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated
in  this evaluation.  Based on this evaluation, Messrs.
Weldon  and  Caruso concluded that, as of the  date  of
their evaluation, the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures were effective.

Internal  control.  During the period covered  by  this
report, there were no changes in the Company's internal
control  over financial reporting that have  materially
affected,   or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially
affect,  the Company's internal control over  financial
reporting.
