Item 1A. Risk Factors    Information regarding risk factors appears in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was filed with the SEC on February 11, 2008. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Annual Report on Form 10-K, except:  OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING OR REDUCE OUR FLEXIBILITY TO ACT IN OUR BEST INTERESTS.   As of September 30, 2008, we had outstanding $287.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2013. The level of our indebtedness could affect us by:    •exposing us to fixed rates of interest, which may be in excess of prevailing market rates;   •making it more difficult to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes;   •constraining our ability to react quickly in an unfavorable economic climate or to changes in our business or the pharmaceutical industry; and   •requiring the dedication of substantial cash to service the semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes.     SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, in particular, our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in Part I—Item 2, contain or incorporate a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding:    •our expectations regarding clinical trials, development timelines and regulatory authority filings for telaprevir, VX-770 and other drug candidates under development by us and our collaborators;   •our expectations regarding the number of patients that will be evaluated, the trial design that will be utilized, the anticipated date by which enrollment will be completed and the expected date by which SVR data, interim data and/or final data will be available and/or publicly announced for our ADVANCE Phase 3 clinical trial, the REALIZE Phase 3 clinical trial, the other ongoing or planned clinical trials of telaprevir, the Phase 1 clinical trials and Phase 2a clinical trials of VX-809, the Phase 1b clinical trial of VX-500 and the Phase 1 clinical trial of VX-813, and the clinical trials being conducted by our collaborators of drug candidates for the treatment of cancer;   •expectations regarding our net loss, revenues and costs and expenses in future periods as compared to previous periods;   •the data that will be generated by ongoing and planned clinical trials, and the ability to use that data for the design and initiation of further clinical trials and to support regulatory filings, including potentially applications for marketing approval for telaprevir and VX-770;   44      Table of Contents     •our ability to potentially register telaprevir for marketing across a range of genotypes and patient populations;   •our intention to work with regulatory authorities in North America and Europe to design a registration program for VX-770, which, if approved, could begin the first half of 2009;   •our expectations regarding the future market demand and medical need for telaprevir and our other drug candidates;   •our beliefs regarding the support provided by clinical trials and preclinical and nonclinical studies of our drug candidates for further investigation, clinical trials or potential use as a treatment of those drug candidates;   •our ability to capitalize on the advances in our telaprevir clinical program by building our drug development, supply chain management and commercialization organizations in order to prepare for the potential commercial launch of telaprevir and to support the development of our other drug candidates;   •the focus of our drug development efforts and our financial and management resources and our plan to invest significant resources in telaprevir and our other drug candidates;   •the establishment, development and maintenance of collaborative relationships;   •our ability to use our research programs to identify and develop new drug candidates to address serious diseases and significant unmet medical needs;   •our estimates regarding obligations associated with a lease of a facility in Kendall Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts; and   •our liquidity and our expectations regarding our needs for additional capital.

Many factors mentioned in our discussion in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will be important in determining future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual future results may vary materially from expected results.

While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such forward-looking statements.  45      Table of Contents      Item 2.
