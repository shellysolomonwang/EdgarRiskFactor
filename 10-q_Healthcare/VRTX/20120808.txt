Item 1A. Risk Factors    Information regarding risk factors appears in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, which was filed with the SEC on February 22, 2012 as supplemented by Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, which was filed with the SEC on May 10, 2012. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Annual Report on Form 10-K as supplemented by our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, except:   In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded a $78.0 million charge for excess and obsolete INCIVEK inventories, and future adverse changes in the outlook for commercial sales of INCIVEK could result in additional inventory write-downs and related charges.   In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded a $78.0 million charge for excess and obsolete INCIVEK inventories. The charge was based on an analysis of our INCIVEK inventory levels in relation to our commercial outlook for INCIVEK. As part of the analysis, we considered, among other factors, (i) recent decreases in demand for INCIVEK and our expectation the demand will decrease further in the second half of 2012, (ii) the potential development by us and our competitors of other drugs and combination treatments for HCV infection, (iii) positive results released in the second quarter of 2012 from Phase 2 clinical trials of drug candidates being developed by our competitors and (iv) the recent initiation by our competitors of a number of additional Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials of drug candidates for the treatment of HCV infection. We will continue to evaluate our INCIVEK inventories on a quarterly basis, and future adverse changes in the outlook for commercial sales of INCIVEK, including changes due to future developments with respect to demand for INCIVEK or the advancement or approval of other drugs or combination treatments for HCV infection, could result in additional inventory write-downs and related charges in future periods, which could be material.
