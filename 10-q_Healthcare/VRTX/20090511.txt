Item 1A. Risk Factors    Information regarding risk factors appears in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was filed with the SEC on February 17, 2009. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Annual Report on Form 10-K, except:   WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING ANY OF THE DRUG CANDIDATES WE RECENTLY ACQUIRED IN THE VIROCHEM TRANSACTION AND, AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT REALIZE ANY BENEFITS FROM THIS ACQUISITION AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FUTURE PERIODS.   In March 2009, we acquired ViroChem for $100.0 million in cash and 10.7 million shares of our common stock. We acquired ViroChem primarily in order to acquire rights to two HCV polymerase inhibitors, VCH-222 and VCH-759, as part of our strategy to pursue drug candidates that could potentially be developed in combination with telaprevir or our earlier-stage protease inhibitors. VCH-222 and VCH-759 are still in Phase 1 clinical development and have only been evaluated in preclinical studies and in a limited number of patients with HCV. While we believe the data from the clinical trials to date, together with studies in animal models and  in vitro data, support the development of combination therapies, there are numerous reasons why we may not be able to successfully develop a combination involving either VCH-222 or VCH-759, including:    •data from trials involving drug candidates separately may not be predictive of results involving drug candidates dosed in combination, including as a result of unforeseen drug interactions; and   •positive results in small clinical trials and preclinical studies may not be predictive of results in clinical trials involving large numbers of patients.    There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop either VCH-222 or VCH-759 in combination with telaprevir or our other HCV protease inhibitors, or at all, and if we are not successful in developing VCH-222 or VCH-759, we may not realize any benefits from our recently completed acquisition.   We allocated $525.9 million to intangible assets related to the in-process research and development associated with the ViroChem drug candidates. If the value of these drug candidates becomes impaired, we may incur significant impairment charges, including potentially the entire amount of the intangible assets reflected on our condensed consolidated balance sheets associated with the drug candidate, in the period in which the impairment becomes known. An impairment could result from, among other things, unfavorable safety or efficacy results from clinical trials or non-clinical studies or competitive factors affecting the potential market for the drug candidate. If we incur a significant impairment charge in a future period related to the intangible assets acquired in the ViroChem transaction, the value of our common stock could decrease.   SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, in particular, our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in Part I—Item 2, contain or incorporate a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding:    •our expectations regarding clinical trials, development timelines and regulatory authority filings for telaprevir, VX-770, VX-809, VCH-222 and other drug candidates under development by us and our collaborators including our intention to file an NDA for telaprevir in the United States in the second half of 2010;   42      Table of Contents     •our expectations regarding the number of patients that will be evaluated, the trial design that will be utilized, and the expected date by which SVR data, interim data and/or final data will be available and/or publicly announced for our ADVANCE, REALIZE and ILLUMINATE trials, the other ongoing or planned clinical trials of telaprevir, the registration program for VX-770, the Phase 2a clinical trials of VX-809, the Phase 1 clinical trial of VCH-222, and the clinical trials being conducted by our collaborators of drug candidates for the treatment of cancer;   •expectations regarding the amount of, timing of and trends with respect to our revenues and costs and expenses;   •the data that will be generated by ongoing and planned clinical trials, and the ability to use that data for the design and initiation of further clinical trials and to support regulatory filings, including potentially applications for marketing approval for telaprevir and VX-770;   •our ability to potentially register telaprevir for marketing across a range of genotypes and patient populations;   •our intention to begin the registration program for VX-770 in the second quarter of 2009;   •our plan to begin clinical evaluation of novel combination regimens of telaprevir with VCH-222 and/or VCH-759 by the end of 2009;   •our expectations regarding the future market demand and medical need for telaprevir and our other drug candidates;   •our beliefs regarding the support provided by clinical trials and preclinical and nonclinical studies of our drug candidates for further investigation, clinical trials or potential use as a treatment of those drug candidates;   •our ability to successfully market telaprevir and VX-770 if we are able to obtain regulatory approval;   •the focus of our drug development efforts and our financial and management resources and our plan to invest significant resources in telaprevir and our other drug candidates;   •the establishment, development and maintenance of collaborative relationships;   •potential business development activities, including with respect to our JAK3 program;   •our ability to use our research programs to identify and develop new drug candidates to address serious diseases and significant unmet medical needs;   •our estimates regarding obligations associated with a lease of a facility in Kendall Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts; and   •our liquidity and our expectations regarding our needs for and ability to raise additional capital.    Without limiting the foregoing, the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "intends," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in our discussion in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will be important in determining future results. Consequently, no forward- looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual future results may vary materially from expected results. We also provide a cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was filed with the SEC on February 17, 2009, and updated and supplemented by "Part II—Item 1A—Risk Factors" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results. Other  43      Table of Contents  factors besides those listed could also adversely affect us. In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent our estimate only as of the date of this filing and should not be relied upon as representing our estimate as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such forward-looking statements.
