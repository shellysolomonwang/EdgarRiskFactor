Item 1A. Risk FactorsInformation regarding risk factors appears in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was filed with the SEC on February 23, 2017. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Annual Report on Form 10-K, except that:Our business depends on the success of tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, which has not been approved by the FDA or the European Commission. If we are unable to obtain marketing approval or experience material delays in obtaining marketing approval for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, our business will be materially harmed.In the first quarter of 2017, we obtained positive results from two Phase 3 clinical trials of tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor that showed statistically significant improvements in lung function in patients with CF 12 years of age and older who have certain mutations in their CFTR gene. Based on these results, we plan to submit an NDA in the United States and an MAA in Europe for this potential combination regimen in the third quarter of 2017. Obtaining approval of an NDA or an MAA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and we may not be successful. Obtaining marketing approval for the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor in one country or region does not ensure that we will be able to obtain marketing approval in any other country or region. Obtaining approval to market the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor will depend on many factors, including:•whether or not the FDA and European regulatory authorities determine that the evidence gathered in well-controlled clinical trials, other clinical trials and nonclinical studies demonstrates that tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor is safe and effective as a treatment for patients for whom marketing approval is sought;37•whether or not the FDA and European regulatory authorities are satisfied that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls for the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor are adequate, that the labeling is satisfactory and that plans for post-marketing studies, safety monitoring and risk evaluation and mitigation are sufficient; and•the timing and nature of the FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA's, comments and questions regarding the NDA and MAA for the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, the scheduling and recommendations of any advisory committee meeting to consider the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, the time required to respond to the FDA or EMA’s comments and questions and to obtain the final labeling for the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor and any other delays that may be associated with the NDA and MAA review process.Even if a product is approved, the FDA or the European Commission, as the case may be, may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval. If we experience material delays in obtaining marketing approval for the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor in either the United States or Europe, our future net product revenues and cash flows will be adversely effected. If we do not obtain approval to market the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor in the United States or Europe, our business will be materially harmed. Additionally, even if the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor receives marketing approval, coverage and reimbursement may not be available and, even if it is available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. The regulations that govern pricing, coverage and reimbursement for drugs vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing approval is granted. Adverse pricing limitations or a delay in obtaining coverage and reimbursement will hinder our future net product revenues and may harm our business.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of our pending acquisition of CTP-656 from Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc.In March 2017, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Concert, pursuant to which we expect to acquire certain assets including CTP-656, an investigational CFTR potentiator that has the potential to be used as part of future once-daily combination regimens of CFTR modulators that treat the underlying cause of CF. Acquisitions are inherently risky and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transaction, which involves numerous risks including:•that we fail to successfully develop and/or integrate CTP-656 into our pipeline in order to achieve our strategic objectives;•that we receive inadequate or unfavorable data from clinical trials evaluating the CTP-656 in combination with other CFTR modulators; and•the potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of CTP-656 or any of the other assets acquired from Concert, including but not limited to, problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges with respect to intellectual property, product quality, safety, and other known and unknown liabilities.In addition, the acquisition remains subject to approval by Concert's shareholders and clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. If we do not complete the acquisition successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition or license to the extent anticipated.SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, in particular, our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in Part I-Item 2, contain or incorporate a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding:•our expectations regarding the amount of, timing of and trends with respect to our revenues, costs and expenses and other gains and losses, including those related to net product revenues from KALYDECO and ORKAMBI;•our expectations regarding clinical trials, development timelines, timing of our receipt of data from our ongoing and planned clinical trials and regulatory authority filings and submissions for our products and drug candidates, including the planned NDA and MAA submissions for tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor and the ongoing and planned clinical trials to evaluate our next-generation correctors;38•our ability to successfully market KALYDECO and ORKAMBI or any of our other drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval;•the data that will be generated by ongoing and planned clinical trials and the ability to use that data to advance compounds, continue development or support regulatory filings;•our beliefs regarding the support provided by clinical trials and preclinical and nonclinical studies of our drug candidates for further investigation, clinical trials or potential use as a treatment;•our plan to continue investing in our research and development programs and our strategy to develop our drug candidates, alone or with third party-collaborators;•the establishment, development and maintenance of collaborative relationships;•potential business development activities;•the potential closing of the Concert transaction;•potential fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;•our ability to use our research programs to identify and develop new drug candidates to address serious diseases and significant unmet medical needs; and•our liquidity and our expectations regarding the possibility of raising additional capital.Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may turn out to be wrong.
