Item 1A. Risk FactorsInformation regarding risk factors appears in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was filed with the SEC on March 1, 2013. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Annual Report on Form 10-K except:39Table of ContentsIn July 2013, the FDA placed our U.S. clinical trial evaluating VX-135, a drug candidate for the treatment of HCV infection, on partial clinical hold, and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot develop VX-135 or if we are significantly delayed in developing VX-135.We are developing our HCV nucleotide analogue VX-135 as a potential treatment for HCV infection. In July 2013, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in the United States of VX-135 in combination with RBV in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection. The partial clinical hold prevents us from evaluating a 200 mg dose of VX-135 in the United States following observation of reversible elevated liver enzymes in patients who received 400 mg of VX-135 in combination with RBV in a Phase 2 clinical trial in Europe. There is no assurance that the FDA will lift the partial clinical hold after we submit additional clinical, preclinical and pharmacokinetic data from ongoing VX-135 clinical trials or that we will be able to successfully develop VX-135. If we are not able to develop VX-135, or if our progress in developing VX-135 is slowed significantly, our business may be adversely affected.SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, in particular, our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in Part I-Item 2, contain or incorporate a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding:•expectations regarding the amount of, timing of and trends with respect to our revenues, costs and expenses and other gains and losses, including those related to net product revenues from sales of INCIVEK and KALYDECO and royalty revenues from net sales of INCIVO and to the intangible assets associated with the Alios collaboration;•our expectations regarding clinical trials, development timelines and regulatory authority filings and submissions for ivacaftor, VX-135, VX-509, VX-661, VX-809 and VX-983;•our expectations regarding the timing of data from our clinical trials of ivacaftor monotherapy and VX-809 (lumacaftor) in combination with ivacaftor, the possibility of using that data to support regulatory submissions and the timing of those potential submissions;•our ability to successfully market INCIVEK and/or KALYDECO or any of our other drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval;•our expectations regarding the timing and structure of clinical trials of our drugs and drug candidates, including, ivacaftor, VX-135, VX-509, VX-661, VX-809 and VX-983, and the expected timing of our receipt of data from our ongoing and planned clinical trials;•our expectation that we will complete submission to the FDA of additional clinical, preclinical and pharmacokinetic data from ongoing VX-135 clinical trials in the fourth quarter of 2013;•the data that will be generated by ongoing and planned clinical trials and the ability to use that data to support regulatory filings;•our beliefs regarding the support provided by clinical trials and preclinical and nonclinical studies of our drug candidates for further investigation, clinical trials or potential use as a treatment;•the focus of our drug development efforts and our financial and management resources and our plan to continue investing in our research and development programs and our strategy to develop our drug candidates, alone or with third party-collaborators;•the establishment, development and maintenance of collaborative relationships;•potential business development activities;•our ability to use our research programs to identify and develop new drug candidates to address serious diseases and significant unmet medical needs;40Table of Contents•our estimates regarding obligations associated with a lease of a facility in Kendall Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts; and•our liquidity and our expectations regarding the possibility of raising additional capital.Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may turn out to be wrong.
