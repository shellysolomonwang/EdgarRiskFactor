Item 1A. Risk Factors    Information regarding risk factors appears in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, which was filed with the SEC on February 19, 2010. There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in that Annual Report on Form 10-K, but in connection with receipt of data from our Phase 3 clinical trials in our registration program for telaprevir we are updating our risk factor regarding our dependence on telaprevir to focus on (i) the risks associated with obtaining approval for telaprevir and (ii) the risks associated with commercializing telaprevir. The updated risk factors are as follows:   We depend heavily on the success of our lead drug candidate, telaprevir, which has not yet been approved by the FDA. If we experience material delays in obtaining or are unable to obtain marketing approval for telaprevir our business will be materially harmed.   We believe that a significant portion of the value attributed to our company by investors relates to the commercial potential of telaprevir, which has not yet been approved by the FDA. While we and Janssen have completed the Phase 3 clinical trials in the registration program for telaprevir, we need to obtain approval from the FDA to market telaprevir in the United States. Submitting an NDA for approval of a drug candidate, such as telaprevir, is a complex and resource-intensive process. In addition, the FDA will have substantial discretion in deciding whether or not telaprevir should be granted approval based on the benefits and risks of telaprevir-based therapies in the treatment of genotype 1 HCV infection.   Obtaining approval to market telaprevir in a timely manner will depend on many factors, including the following:    •successful completion and submission of our NDA, which will require, among other things, compiling, analyzing and synthesizing data from the clinical trials of telaprevir; developing proposed labeling; and providing plans for post-marketing studies, safety monitoring and risk evaluation and mitigation;   •whether or not the FDA determines that the evidence gathered in well-controlled clinical trials, other clinical trials and nonclinical studies of telaprevir demonstrates that telaprevir is safe and effective as a treatment for genotype 1 HCV infection;   •whether or not the FDA is satisfied that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls for telaprevir are adequate, that labeling is satisfactory and plans for post-marketing studies, safety monitoring and risk evaluation and mitigation are sufficient; and   49      Table of Contents   •the timing and nature of the FDA's comments and questions regarding the NDA for telaprevir, the scheduling and recommendations of any advisory committee meeting to consider telaprevir, the time required to respond to the FDA's comments and questions and to obtain the final labeling for telaprevir and any delays that may be associated with the NDA review process.    If we experience material delays or are unable to obtain marketing approval for telaprevir in the United States, our business will be materially harmed.   In addition, Janssen will need to seek approval from the EMA to market telaprevir in the European Union. The regulatory process in the European Union is similar to the process in the United States, but typically takes longer to complete. If Janssen experiences material delays or is unable to obtain marketing approval for telaprevir in its territories, our business may be materially harmed.   In order to execute our business plan and achieve profitability, we need to effectively commercialize telaprevir.   We can not be sure that telaprevir will be commercially successful in the pharmaceutical market even if we and Janssen gain marketing approval for telaprevir in a timely manner. In addition to the other challenges related to a company launching its first commercial drug, we may face competition from Merck & Co., Inc., which is developing boceprevir, a potentially competitive HCV protease inhibitor. In August 2010, Merck announced that the primary endpoints in the Phase 3 clinical trials of boceprevir had been achieved and that Merck expected to complete the regulatory submissions for boceprevir in the United States and European Union in 2010.   We expect that the initial commercial success of telaprevir will depend on many factors, including the following:    •the efficacy, cost, breadth of approved use, side-effect profile and cost of co-therapies of telaprevir-based treatment regimens relative to competitive treatment regimens, including boceprevir if it is approved;   •the relative timing of marketing approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for telaprevir and boceprevir;   •the effectiveness of our commercial strategy for the launch and marketing of telaprevir;   •the number of patients with genotype 1 HCV infection, including treatment-naïve patients and patients who did not achieve an SVR with prior treatment, who seek treatment;   •maintaining and successfully monitoring commercial manufacturing arrangements for telaprevir with third-party manufacturers to ensure they meet our standards and those of regulatory authorities, including the FDA, which extensively regulate and monitor pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities;   •our ability to increase awareness of the benefits of early treatment of HCV infection and to increase the rates of diagnosis and subsequent treatment of currently undiagnosed patients with genotype 1 HCV infection;   •the acceptance of telaprevir by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; and   •the effect of new health care legislation currently being implemented in the United States.    If we do not effectively commercialize telaprevir, we will not be able to execute our business plan and may not be able to achieve profitability. If our revenues, market share and/or other indicators of market acceptance of telaprevir do not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the market price of our common stock would likely decline.  50      Table of Contents  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, in particular, our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in Part I—Item 2, contain or incorporate a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding:    •our expectations regarding clinical trials, development timelines and regulatory authority filings and submissions for telaprevir, VX-770, VX-222, VX-809, VX-509, VX-765, including our intention to complete the NDA submission for telaprevir in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2010, Janssen's plans to submit its MAA for telaprevir to the EMA in the fourth quarter of 2010, and the possibility that we could submit an NDA to the FDA for VX-770 in the second half of 2011;   •our belief that if we are able to successfully commercialize telaprevir in accordance with current development timelines, we will begin generating revenues and cash flows from sales of telaprevir in 2011;   •our ability to successfully market telaprevir and VX-770 or any of our other drug candidates if we are able to obtain regulatory approval;   •our expectations regarding the timing and structure of clinical trials of our other drug candidates, including telaprevir, VX-770, VX-222, VX-509 and VX-765 and combinations of telaprevir with VX-222 and VX-770 with VX-809, and the timing of our receipt of data from our VX-770 registration program and data from our VX-765 and VX-509 clinical trials;   •expectations regarding the amount of, timing of and trends with respect to our revenues, costs and expenses and other gains and losses, including those related to the intangible assets associated with the ViroChem acquisition and to the liabilities we recorded in connection with the September 2009 financial transactions;   •the data that will be generated by ongoing and planned clinical trials and the ability to use that data to support regulatory filings, including potential applications for marketing approval for telaprevir and VX-770;   •our beliefs regarding the support provided by clinical trials and preclinical and nonclinical studies of our drug candidates for further investigation, clinical trials or potential use as a treatment;   •the focus of our drug development efforts and our financial and management resources and our plan to continue investing in our research and development programs and to develop selected drug candidates that emerge from those programs, alone or with third-party collaborators;   •the establishment, development and maintenance of collaborative relationships;   •potential business development activities;   •our ability to use our research programs to identify and develop new drug candidates to address serious diseases and significant unmet medical needs;   •our estimates regarding obligations associated with a lease of a facility in Kendall Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts; and   •our liquidity and our expectations regarding the possibility of raising additional capital.
