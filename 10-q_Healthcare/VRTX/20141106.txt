Item 1A. Risk FactorsInformation regarding risk factors appears in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was filed with the SEC on February 11, 2014. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Annual Report on Form 10-K, except that:Our business and future net product revenues depend heavily on the success of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, which has not been approved by the FDA or the European Commission. If we are unable to obtain marketing approval or experience material delays in obtaining marketing approval for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor our business will be materially harmed. We believe that a significant portion of the value attributed to our company by investors is based on the commercial potential of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. In November 2014, we submitted an NDA in the United States and an MAA, in Europe for this potential combination regimen. Obtaining approval of an NDA or an MAA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and we may not be successful. Obtaining marketing approval for the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in one country or region does not ensure that we will be able to obtain marketing approval in any other country or region.Obtaining approval to market the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor will depend on many factors, including: •whether or not the FDA and European regulatory authorities determine that the evidence gathered in well-controlled clinical trials, other clinical trials and nonclinical studies demonstrates that lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor is safe and effective as a treatment for patients with CF 12 years of age and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation;•whether or not the FDA and European regulatory authorities are satisfied that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls for the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor are adequate, that the labeling is satisfactory and that plans for post-marketing studies, safety monitoring and risk evaluation and mitigation are sufficient; and •the timing and nature of the FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA's, comments and questions regarding the NDA and MAA for the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, the scheduling and recommendations of any advisory committee meeting to consider the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, the time required to respond to the FDA or EMA’s comments and questions and to obtain the final labeling for the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor and any other delays that may be associated with the NDA and MAA review process. Even if a product is approved, the FDA or the European Commission, as the case may be, may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval. If we experience material delays in obtaining marketing approval for the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in either the United States or Europe, our future net product revenues and cash flows will be adversely effected. If we do not obtain approval to market the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in the United States or Europe, our business will be materially harmed. Additionally, even if the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor receives marketing approval, coverage and reimbursement may not be available and, even if it is available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. The regulations that govern pricing, coverage and reimbursement for drugs vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing approval is granted. Adverse pricing limitations or a delay in obtaining coverage and reimbursement will hinder our future net product revenues and may harm our business.Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and the terms of our credit agreement impose restrictions on our business, reducing our operational flexibility and creating default risks. In July 2014, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for a $300.0 million senior secured term loan. We are required to repay principal on the loan in installments of $15.0 million per quarter from October 1, 2015 through July 1, 2016 and in installments of $60.0 million per quarter from October 1, 2016 through July 9, 2017.36Table of ContentsOur indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse financial, business, economic and industry conditions, as well as other factors that are beyond our control. Beginning in October 2015, we will be required to begin repayment of the principal amount of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of future cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes.The credit agreement requires that we maintain, on a quarterly basis, a minimum level of KALYDECO net revenues. Further, the credit agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, pay dividends, repurchase capital stock and enter into transactions with affiliates. As a result, we may be restricted from engaging in business activities that may otherwise improve our business. Failure to comply with the covenants could result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owing under the credit agreement and/or our capital leases and could have a material adverse impact on our business.Additionally, our obligations under the facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. All obligations under the facilities, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of our assets and the assets of all guarantors, including the pledge of all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries. If we fail to satisfy our obligations under the credit agreement or are unable to obtain sufficient funds to make payments, the lenders could foreclose on our pledged collateral.SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, in particular, our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in Part I-Item 2, contain or incorporate a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding:•our expectations regarding the amount of, timing of and trends with respect to our revenues, costs and expenses and other gains and losses, including those related to net product revenues from KALYDECO and INCIVEK;•our expectations regarding clinical trials, development timelines and regulatory authority filings and submissions for ivacaftor, lumacaftor and VX-661, including the expected NDA and MAA filings for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor;•our ability to successfully market KALYDECO, lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, if approved, or any of our other drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval;•our expectations regarding the timing and structure of clinical trials of our drugs and drug candidates, including, ivacaftor, lumacaftor and VX-661, and the expected timing of our receipt of data from our ongoing and planned clinical trials;•the data that will be generated by ongoing and planned clinical trials and the ability to use that data to advance compounds, continue development or support regulatory filings;•our beliefs regarding the support provided by clinical trials and preclinical and nonclinical studies of our drug candidates for further investigation, clinical trials or potential use as a treatment;•our plan to continue investing in our research and development programs and our strategy to develop our drug candidates, alone or with third party-collaborators;•the establishment, development and maintenance of collaborative relationships;•potential business development activities;•our ability to use our research programs to identify and develop new drug candidates to address serious diseases and significant unmet medical needs; and•our liquidity and our expectations regarding the possibility of raising additional capital.37Table of ContentsAny or all of our forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may turn out to be wrong.
