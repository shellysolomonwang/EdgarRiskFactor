ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSRisks Related to the Business of MylanABBOTT’S SUBSIDIARIES THAT HOLD ORDINARY SHARES ARE COLLECTIVELY A SIGNIFICANT BENEFICIAL SHAREHOLDER OF OURS AND THE PRESENCE OF A SIGNIFICANT BENEFICIAL SHAREHOLDER MAY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF OUR OTHER SHAREHOLDERS TO EXERCISE INFLUENCE OVER US, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF CERTAIN VOTING OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT WITH ABBOTT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.Abbott’s subsidiaries collectively own approximately 14.2% of our outstanding voting securities as of the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The shares owned by Abbott’s subsidiaries are subject to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement, which requires the Abbott subsidiaries to vote in favor of the director nominees recommended by our board of directors and in accordance with the recommendation of our board of directors on all other matters, subject to certain exceptions for extraordinary transactions. This voting agreement is in force with respect to ordinary shares owned by Abbott’s subsidiaries so long as they collectively beneficially own at least five percent of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares. Abbott’s subsidiaries that hold ordinary shares are collectively a significant beneficial shareholder of ours. Having a significant beneficial shareholder that is required in many instances to vote with the recommendation of our board of directors may make it more difficult for our other shareholders to exercise influence over most matters submitted to shareholders for approval, including the election of directors, issuances of securities for equity compensation plans, amendments to the Articles, and shareholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. Additionally, such Abbott subsidiaries are obligated, pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement, not to tender any ordinary shares in any tender or exchange offer that our board of directors recommends that the shareholders reject and, if our board of directors has recommended against a transaction, such Abbott subsidiaries are required to vote against such transaction, which may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, a majority of our outstanding ordinary shares in a public takeover offer, or control of our board of directors through a proxy solicitation. PROVISIONS IN OUR GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS OR THAT ARE OTHERWISE AVAILABLE UNDER DUTCH LAW COULD DISCOURAGE, DELAY, OR PREVENT A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF US AND MAY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES.Some provisions of our governance arrangements that are available under Dutch law, such as our grant to a Dutch foundation (stichting) of a call option to acquire preferred shares to safeguard the interests of the Company, its businesses and its stakeholders against threats to our strategy, mission, independence, continuity and/or identity, may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of us, even if such a change in control is sought by our shareholders. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS MUST RELY ON INCREASES IN THE TRADING PRICE OF THE ORDINARY SHARES TO OBTAIN A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT.Mylan N.V. does not anticipate paying dividends in the immediate future. We anticipate that we will retain all earnings, if any, to support our operations and to pursue additional transactions to deliver additional shareholder value. Any future determination as to the payment of dividends will, subject to Dutch law requirements, be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial position, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors our board of directors deems relevant at that time. Holders of Mylan N.V.’s ordinary shares must rely on increases in the trading price of their shares to obtain a return on their investment in the foreseeable future.61Table of ContentsTHE MARKET PRICE OF THE ORDINARY SHARES MAY BE VOLATILE, AND THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT COULD MATERIALLY DECLINE.Investors who hold Mylan N.V.’s ordinary shares may not be able to sell their shares at or above the price at which they purchased such shares. The share price of Mylan Inc.’s common stock prior to the consummation of the EPD Transaction fluctuated materially from time to time, and we cannot predict the price of the ordinary shares at any given time. The risk factors described herein could cause the price of the ordinary shares to fluctuate materially. In addition, the stock market in general, including the market for generic and specialty pharmaceutical companies, has experienced price and volume fluctuations. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of the ordinary shares, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, the price of the ordinary shares may be affected by the valuations and recommendations of the analysts who cover us, and if our results do not meet the analysts’ forecasts and expectations, the price of the ordinary shares could decline as a result of analysts lowering their valuations and recommendations or otherwise. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market and/or in the price of a company’s stock, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against other companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price. We also may undertake additional offerings of ordinary shares or of securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for ordinary shares. The resulting increase in the number of the ordinary shares issued and outstanding and the possibility of sales of such ordinary shares or such securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for ordinary shares after any such additional offerings may depress the future trading price of the ordinary shares. In addition, if additional offerings occur, the voting power of our then existing shareholders may be diluted.THE EPD TRANSACTION MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE INTENDED BENEFITS OR MAY DISRUPT OUR PLANS AND OPERATIONS.There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the EPD Business with the business of Mylan Inc. or otherwise realize the expected benefits of the EPD Transaction. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the EPD Transaction will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the EPD Business with the business of Mylan Inc. and realize the benefits of the combined business. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to effectively manage its expanded operations. The integration requires significant time and focus from management and may divert attention from the day-to-day operations of our business. Additionally, the integration of the businesses could disrupt our plans and operations, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. The expected synergies and operating efficiencies of the EPD Transaction may not be fully realized, which could result in increased costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price. In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management’s attention, among other potential adverse consequences. The difficulties of combining the operations of the businesses include, among others: •the diversion of management’s attention to integration matters; •difficulties in achieving anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies, business opportunities, and growth prospects from combining the EPD Business with the business of Mylan Inc.; •difficulties in the integration of operations and systems, including enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems; •difficulties in the integration of employees; •difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company; •challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; •challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and •the complexities of managing the ongoing relationship with Abbott, and certain of its business partners, which includes agreements providing for transition services, manufacturing relationships, and license arrangements. Many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could have a material adverse effect on 62Table of Contentsour business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price. In addition, even if the operations of Mylan Inc. and the EPD Business are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the EPD Transaction, including the synergies, operating efficiencies, or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. All of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the EPD Transaction, and/or negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares.WE EXPECT TO BE TREATED AS A NON-U.S. CORPORATION FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. ANY CHANGES TO THE TAX LAWS OR CHANGES IN OTHER LAWS, REGULATIONS, RULES, OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF APPLICABLE TO INVERTED COMPANIES AND THEIR AFFILIATES, WHETHER ENACTED BEFORE OR AFTER THE EPD TRANSACTION, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US.Under current U.S. law, we believe that we should not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the EPD Transaction. Changes to Section 7874 of the Code or the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or interpretations thereof, could affect our status as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application, and may apply even if enacted or promulgated now that the EPD Transaction has closed. If we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would likely be subject to significantly greater U.S. tax liability than currently contemplated as a non-U.S. corporation. On August 5, 2014, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it is reviewing a broad range of authorities for possible administrative actions that could limit the ability of a U.S. corporation to complete a transaction in which it becomes a subsidiary of a non-U.S. corporation (commonly known as an “inversion transaction”) or reduce certain tax benefits after an inversion transaction takes place. On September 22, 2014, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a notice announcing its intention to promulgate certain regulations that will apply to inversion transactions completed on or after September 22, 2014. In the notice, the U.S. Treasury Department also announced that it expects to issue additional guidance to further limit certain inversion transactions. In particular, it is considering regulations that may limit income tax treaty eligibility and the ability of certain foreign-owned U.S. corporations to deduct certain interest payments (so-called “earnings stripping”). Any such future guidance will apply prospectively, but to the extent it applies only to companies that have completed inversion transactions, it will specifically apply to companies that have completed such transactions on or after September 22, 2014. Additionally, there have been recent legislative proposals intended to limit or discourage inversion transactions. Any such future regulatory or legislative actions regarding inversion transactions, if taken, could apply to us, could disadvantage us as compared to other corporations, including non-U.S. corporations that have completed inversion transactions prior to September 22, 2014, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.THE IRS MAY NOT AGREE THAT WE SHOULD BE TREATED AS A NON-U.S. CORPORATION FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) may not agree that we should be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although we are not incorporated in the U.S. and expect to be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would likely be subject to significantly greater U.S. tax liability than currently contemplated as a non-U.S. corporation. IF THE INTERCOMPANY TERMS OF CROSS BORDER ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE HAVE AMONG OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE DETERMINED TO BE INAPPROPRIATE OR INEFFECTIVE, OUR TAX LIABILITY MAY INCREASE.We have potential tax exposures resulting from the varying application of statutes, regulations, and interpretations which include exposures on intercompany terms of cross-border arrangements among our subsidiaries (including intercompany loans, sales, and services agreements) in relation to various aspects of our business, including manufacturing, marketing, sales, and delivery functions. Although we believe our cross-border arrangements among our subsidiaries are based upon internationally accepted standards and applicable law, tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree with and subsequently challenge the amount of profits taxed in their country, which may result in increased tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties, which would cause our tax expense to increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.63Table of ContentsTHE EPD TRANSACTION MAY NOT GIVE US THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE COMPETITIVE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND EXPECTED EFFECTIVE CORPORATE TAX RATE.We believe that the EPD Transaction will give us the ability to achieve competitive financial flexibility and a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate. Mylan Inc.’s adjusted tax rate was approximately 25% in 2014, and our adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 19-21% in 2015 and in the high teens thereafter. Material assumptions relating to the fact that certain of our businesses, including parts of the EPD Business underlying our expected adjusted tax rates include assumptions relating to the fact that certain Mylan businesses, including parts of the EPD Business, will be operated outside the U.S. and, as such, will be subject to a lower tax rate than operations in the U.S., which will result in a lower blended worldwide tax rate than prior to the acquisition of the EPD Business, and the effect of certain internal reorganization transactions, including various intercompany transactions, that were entered into at the time of the EPD Transaction. We cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be, however, because of, among other reasons, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate, potential changes of laws and interpretations thereof, and the potential for tax audits or challenges. Our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate. Such a material change could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN OUR TAX PROVISIONS OR EXPOSURE TO ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX LIABILITIES AND CHANGES IN INCOME TAX LAWS AND TAX RULINGS MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND INCOME TAX EXPENSE.We are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. Significant analysis and judgment are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities, and continuing assessments of our tax exposures could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price. Finally, potential changes to income tax laws in the U.S. include measures which would defer the deduction of interest expense related to deferred income; determine the foreign tax credit on a pooling basis; tax currently excess returns associated with transfers of intangibles offshore; and limit earnings stripping by expatriated entities. In addition, proposals have been made to encourage manufacturing in the U.S., including reduced rates of tax and increased deductions related to manufacturing. We cannot determine whether these proposals will be modified or enacted, whether other proposals unknown at this time will be made, or the extent to which the corporate tax rate might be reduced and lessen the adverse impact of some of these proposals. If enacted, and depending on its precise terms, such legislation could materially increase our overall effective income tax rate and income tax expense and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE MAY BE OR BECOME TAXABLE IN A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE UNITED KINGDOM OR THE  NETHERLANDS AND MAY REMAIN A DUAL RESIDENT COMPANY FOR TAX PURPOSES FOR AN INDETERMINATE TIME AND THIS MAY INCREASE THE AGGREGATE TAX BURDEN ON US.Based on our current management structure and current tax laws of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, as well as applicable income tax treaties, and current interpretations thereof, we aim to be tax resident solely in the United Kingdom for the purposes of the Netherlands-U.K. tax treaty. We have requested, but have not obtained, binding rulings from the competent authorities in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands confirming this treatment. We will therefore be tax resident in both the U.K. and the Netherlands for an indeterminate time. The principal consequence to our Netherlands tax residency is that we will remain required to withhold Netherlands tax on dividends and proceeds from repurchases and redemptions of our shares, in each case, paid to our shareholders. We are only required to withhold from proceeds of repurchases and redemptions of our ordinary shares to the extent they exceed the average capital paid into those shares for Netherlands tax purposes. However, we currently do not have the intention to pay dividends, as outlined in the risk factor entitled, “We do not anticipate paying dividends for the foreseeable future, and our shareholders must rely on increases in the trading price of the ordinary shares to obtain a return on their investment.” If we did pay dividends, or should we repurchase or 64Table of Contentsredeem our shares, the Netherlands withholding tax may be a burden on us or our shareholders. Even if the above rulings are granted, the applicable tax laws or interpretations thereof may change, or the assumptions on which such rulings were based may differ from the facts. As a consequence, we may be or become a tax resident of a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom or the Netherlands and/or may remain a dual resident company for tax purposes. As a consequence, our overall effective income tax rate and income tax expense could materially increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE HAVE AND WILL INCUR DIRECT AND INDIRECT COSTS AS A RESULT OF THE EPD TRANSACTION.We have incurred costs and expenses in connection with, and will incur further costs and expenses as a result of, the EPD Transaction. Certain costs, including the costs associated with consummating an inversion transaction, are not readily ascertainable and are difficult to quantify and determine. These costs and expenses include professional fees associated with complying with Dutch corporate law and financial reporting requirements, professional fees associated with complying with the tax laws of the United Kingdom, and costs and expenses incurred in connection with holding a majority of the meetings of our board of directors and certain executive management meetings in the United Kingdom, as well as any additional costs we may incur going forward as a result of our new corporate structure. These costs may materially exceed the costs historically borne by us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE HAVE GROWN AT A VERY RAPID PACE AND EXPECT TO AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAKE FINANCIAL AND STRATEGIC SENSE FOR US. OUR INABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OR SUPPORT THIS GROWTH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND/OR ORDINARY SHARE PRICE.We have grown very rapidly over the past several years as a result of increasing sales and several acquisitions and other transactions, and expect to aggressively pursue additional acquisition opportunities that make financial and strategic sense for us. We evaluate various strategic transactions and business arrangements, including acquisitions, asset purchases, partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures and investments, on an ongoing basis. These transactions and arrangements may be material both from a strategic and financial perspective.We are currently in the process of evaluating certain potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, and we may choose to aggressively pursue one or more of these opportunities at any time. Some of these opportunities would be material if pursued and consummated. Our growth has, and will continue to, put significant demands on our processes, systems, and employees. We have made and expect to make further investments in additional personnel, systems, and internal control processes to help manage our growth. Attracting, retaining and motivating key employees in various departments and locations to support our growth are critical to our business, and competition for these people can be significant. If we are unable to hire and/or retain qualified employees and/or if we do not effectively invest in systems and processes to manage and support our rapid growth and the challenges and difficulties associated with managing a larger, more complex business, and/or if we cannot effectively manage and integrate our increasingly diverse and global platform, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.CURRENT AND CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INDUSTRY, BUSINESS, PARTNERS AND SUPPLIERS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND/OR ORDINARY SHARE PRICE.The global economy continues to experience significant volatility, and the economic environment may continue to be, or become, less favorable than that of past years. Among other matters, the continued risk of a default on sovereign debt by one or more European countries, related financial restructuring efforts in Europe, and/or evolving deficit and spending reduction programs instituted by the U.S. and other governments could negatively impact the global economy and/or the pharmaceutical industry. This has led, and/or could lead, to reduced consumer and customer spending and/or reduced or eliminated governmental or third party payor coverage or reimbursement in the foreseeable future, and this may include reduced spending on health care, including but not limited to pharmaceutical products. While generic drugs present an alternative to higher-priced branded products, our sales could be negatively impacted if patients forego obtaining health care, patients and customers reduce spending or purchases, and/or if governments and/or third-party payors reduce or eliminate coverage or reimbursement amounts for pharmaceuticals and/or impose price or other controls adversely impacting the price or availability of pharmaceuticals. In addition, reduced consumer and customer spending, and/or reduced government and/or third-party payor coverage or reimbursement, and/or new government controls, may drive us and our competitors to decrease prices and/or may reduce the ability of customers to pay and/or may result in reduced demand for our products. The occurrence of any of these risks could 65Table of Contentshave a material adverse effect on our industry, business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ARISING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SCOPE OF OUR OPERATIONS.Our operations extend to numerous countries outside the U.S. and are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations, and customs of various jurisdictions. These risks include, but are not limited to:•compliance with a variety of national and local laws of countries in which we do business, including but not limited to restrictions on the import and export of certain intermediates, drugs, and technologies;•compliance with a variety of U.S. laws including, but not limited to, the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012; and rules relating to the use of certain “conflict minerals” under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and the Consumer Protection Act;•changes in laws, regulations, and practices affecting the pharmaceutical industry and the health care system, including but not limited to imports, exports, manufacturing, quality, cost, pricing, reimbursement, approval, inspection, and delivery of health care;•fluctuations in exchange rates for transactions conducted in currencies other than the functional currency;•differing local product preferences and product requirements;•adverse changes in the economies in which we or our partners and suppliers operate as a result of a slowdown in overall growth, a change in government or economic policies, or financial, political, or social change or instability in such countries that affects the markets in which we operate, particularly emerging markets;•changes in employment laws, wage increases, or rising inflation in the countries in which we or our partners and suppliers operate;•supply disruptions, and increases in energy and transportation costs;•natural disasters, including droughts, floods, and earthquakes in the countries in which we operate;•local disturbances, terrorist attacks, riots, social disruption, or regional hostilities in the countries in which we or our partners and suppliers operate; and•government uncertainty, including as a result of new or changed laws and regulations.We also face the risk that some of our competitors have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations generally and may be able to manage unexpected crises more easily. Furthermore, whether due to language, cultural or other differences, public and other statements that we make may be misinterpreted, misconstrued, or taken out of context in different jurisdictions. Moreover, the internal political stability of, or the relationship between, any country or countries where we conduct business operations may deteriorate. Changes in a country’s political stability or the state of relations between any such countries are difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations. Any such changes could lead to a decline in our profitability and/or adversely impact our ability to do business. Any meaningful deterioration of the political or social stability in and/or diplomatic relations between any countries in which we or our partners and suppliers do business could have a material adverse effect on our operations. The occurrence of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT, U.K. BRIBERY ACT, AND SIMILAR WORLDWIDE ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS, WHICH IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON CERTAIN CONDUCT AND MAY CARRY SUBSTANTIAL FINES AND PENALTIES.We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions. These laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and some have record keeping 66Table of Contentsrequirements. The failure to comply with these laws could result in substantial criminal and/or monetary penalties. We operate in jurisdictions that have experienced corruption, bribery, pay-offs and other similar practices from time-to-time and, in certain circumstances, such practices may be local custom. We have implemented internal control policies and procedures that mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. However, we cannot be certain that these policies and procedures will protect us against liability. There can be no assurance that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe criminal or civil penalties and other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND/OR ORDINARY SHARE PRICE.We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the environment, climate change, regulation of chemicals, employee safety and product safety. These requirements include regulation of the handling, manufacture, transportation, storage, use and disposal of materials, including the discharge of hazardous materials and pollutants into the environment. In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to risks relating to possible releases of hazardous substances into the environment, which could cause environmental or property damage or personal injuries, and which could result in (i) our noncompliance with such environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations and (ii) regulatory enforcement actions or claims for personal injury and property damage against us. If an unapproved or illegal environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations, including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages and fines. The substantial unexpected costs we may incur could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price. In addition, our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase substantially in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations, the development and manufacturing of a new product or increased development or manufacturing activities at any of our facilities. We may be required to expend significant funds and our manufacturing activities could be delayed or suspended, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND/OR ORDINARY SHARE PRICE.Although we report our financial results in U.S. Dollars, a significant portion of our revenues, indebtedness and other liabilities and our costs are denominated in non-U.S. currencies, including among others the Euro, Indian Rupee, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar and Brazilian Real. Our results of operations and, in some cases, cash flows, have in the past been and may in the future be adversely affected by certain movements in currency exchange rates. In particular, the risk of a debt default by one or more European countries and related European or national financial restructuring efforts may cause volatility in the value of the Euro. Defaults or restructurings in other countries could have a similar adverse impact. From time to time, we may implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. The occurrence of any of the above risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.OUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN INDIA MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY REGULATORY, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES OR CHANGE, MAJOR HOSTILITIES, MILITARY ACTIVITY, AND/OR ACTS OF TERRORISM IN SOUTHERN ASIA.In recent years, our Indian subsidiaries have benefited from many policies of the Government of India and the Indian state governments in which they operate, which are designed to promote foreign investment generally, including significant tax incentives, liberalized import and export duties, and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation. There is no assurance that such policies will continue. Various factors, such as changes in the current federal government, could trigger significant changes in India’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies and disrupt business and economic conditions in India generally and our business in particular.In addition, our financial performance may be adversely affected by general economic conditions; economic, fiscal and social policy in India, including changes in exchange rates and controls, interest rates and taxation policies; and social instability and political, economic, or diplomatic developments affecting India in the future. In particular, India has experienced 67Table of Contentssignificant economic growth over the last several years, but faces major challenges in sustaining that growth in the years ahead. These challenges include the need for substantial infrastructure development and improving access to health care and education. Our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified employees and develop and operate our manufacturing facilities in India could be adversely affected if India does not successfully meet these challenges.Southern Asia has, from time to time, experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries, including India and Pakistan, and within the countries themselves. Terrorist attacks, military activity, rioting, or civil or political unrest in the future could influence the Indian economy and our operations and employees by disrupting operations and communications and making travel and the conduct of our business more difficult. Resulting political or social tensions could create a greater perception that investments in companies with Indian operations involve a high degree of risk, and that there is a risk of disruption of services provided by companies with Indian operations, which could impact our customers’ willingness to do business with us and have a material adverse effect on the market for our products. Furthermore, if India were to become engaged in armed hostilities, including but not limited to hostilities that were protracted or involved the threat or use of nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, our India operations, including our recently acquired Agila Specialties (“Agila”) operations in India, might not be able to continue. We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, military conflicts and wars. The occurrence of any of these risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULLY REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE AGILA ACQUISITION.Our acquisition of Agila is subject to integration risks and costs and uncertainties associated with the operation of acquired businesses. The Agila acquisition involves the integration of Agila with our existing business. We have been, and will continue to be, required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating Agila. We may also experience difficulties in combining corporate cultures. Delays or unexpected difficulties in the integration process could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or ordinary share price. Even if we are able to integrate Agila’s operations successfully into our business, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings and operational efficiencies that we expect to realize and these benefits may not be achieved within a reasonable period of time. On September 9, 2013, prior to our completion of the Agila acquisition, the FDA issued a warning letter to Strides Arcolab for its Agila Sterile Manufacturing Facility 2 in Bangalore, India. This facility is one of Agila’s eight FDA-approved sterile manufacturing facilities. We continue to work closely with the FDA to address its observations with respect to this facility and are working to resolve this matter expeditiously. No assurances can be provided that the resolution of the issues identified in the FDA’s letter will not have a material adverse effect on our global injectables business. Failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the Agila acquisition and/or failing to resolve the issues identified in the FDA’s letter could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.AN INABILITY TO IDENTIFY OR SUCCESSFULLY BID FOR SUITABLE ACQUISITION TARGETS, OR CONSUMMATE AND EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE RECENT AND FUTURE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS, OR TO EFFECTIVELY DEAL WITH AND RESPOND TO UNSOLICITED BUSINESS PROPOSALS COULD LIMIT OUR FUTURE GROWTH AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND/OR ORDINARY SHARE PRICE.We intend to continue to seek to expand our product line and/or business platform organically as well as through complementary or strategic acquisitions of other companies, products, or assets or through joint ventures, licensing agreements, or other arrangements. Acquisitions or similar arrangements may prove to be complex and time consuming and require substantial resources and effort. We may compete for certain acquisition targets with companies having greater financial resources than us or other advantages over us that may hinder or prevent us from acquiring a target company or completing another transaction, which could also result in significant diversion of management time, as well as substantial out-of-pocket costs. If an acquisition is consummated, the integration of such acquired business, product, or other assets into us may also be complex, time consuming, and result in substantial costs and risks. The integration process may distract management and/or disrupt our ongoing businesses, which may adversely affect our relationships with customers, employees, partners, suppliers, regulators, and others with whom we have business or other dealings. In addition, there are operational risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses. These risks include, but are not limited to, difficulties in achieving or inability to achieve identified or anticipated financial and operating synergies, cost savings, revenue synergies, and growth opportunities; difficulties in consolidating or inability to effectively consolidate information technology and manufacturing platforms, business applications, and corporate infrastructure; the impact of pre-existing legal and/or regulatory issues, such as quality and 68Table of Contentsmanufacturing concerns, among others; the risks that acquired companies or businesses do not operate to the same quality, manufacturing, or other standards as us; the impacts of substantial indebtedness and assumed liabilities; challenges associated with operating in new markets; and the unanticipated effects of export controls, exchange rate fluctuations, domestic and foreign political conditions, and/or domestic and foreign economic conditions.In addition, in April 2015 we received an unsolicited non-binding expression of interest from Teva to acquire all of our outstanding shares and may receive similar proposals in the future. Such unsolicited business proposals may not be consistent with or enhancing to our financial, operational, or market strategies and may not further the interests of our shareholders and other stakeholders, including employees, creditors, customers, suppliers, relevant patient populations and communities in which Mylan operates. However, the evaluation of and response to such unsolicited business proposals may nevertheless distract management and/or disrupt our ongoing businesses, which may adversely affect our relationships with customers, employees, partners, suppliers, regulators, and others with whom we have business or other dealings.We may be unable to realize synergies or other benefits, including tax savings, expected to result from acquisitions, joint ventures, or other transactions or investments we may undertake, or we may be unable to generate additional revenue to offset any unanticipated inability to realize these expected synergies or benefits. Realization of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions could take longer than expected, and implementation difficulties, unforeseen expenses, complications and delays, market factors, or deterioration in domestic and global economic conditions could reduce the anticipated benefits of any such transactions. We also may inherit legal, regulatory, and other risks that occurred prior to the acquisition, whether known or unknown to us. Any one of these challenges or risks could impair our growth and ability to compete, require us to focus additional resources on integration of operations rather than more profitable activities, require us to reexamine our business strategy, or otherwise cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE MAY DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROSPECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH.We may from time to time consider selling certain assets if (i) we determine that such assets are not critical to our strategy or (ii) we believe the opportunity to monetize the asset is attractive or for various other reasons, including for the reduction of indebtedness. We have explored and will continue to explore the sale of certain non-core assets. Although our expectation is to engage in asset sales only if they advance or otherwise support our overall strategy, any such sale could reduce the size or scope of our business, our market share in particular markets or our opportunities with respect to certain markets, products or therapeutic categories. As a result, any such sale could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects and opportunities for growth, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.CHARGES TO EARNINGS RESULTING FROM ACQUISITIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR ORDINARY SHARE PRICE.Under U.S. GAAP business acquisition accounting standards, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and, in each case, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows:•costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment or relocation expenses;•impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, including acquired in-process research and development;•amortization of intangible assets acquired;•a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired;69Table of Contents•identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, contingent purchase price consideration, income tax contingencies and other non-income tax contingencies, after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comes first;•charges to our operating results to eliminate certain duplicative pre-acquisition activities, to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure;•charges to our operating results resulting from expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and•changes to contingent consideration liabilities, including accretion and fair value adjustments.A significant portion of these adjustments could be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred. Such charges could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.THE SIGNIFICANT AND INCREASING AMOUNT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, MAINLY RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS, MAY LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE FUTURE WHICH COULD LEAD US TO HAVE TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT CHARGES AGAINST EARNINGS.We regularly review our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, for impairment. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment assessment at least annually. Other long-lived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that an impairment may have occurred. The amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet has increased significantly as a result of our acquisitions and other transactions and may increase further following future potential acquisitions. In addition, we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy or execution. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related charges. Certain non-cash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment. Any impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, shareholder’s equity, and/or ordinary share price.THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS HEAVILY REGULATED AND WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.The pharmaceutical industry is subject to regulation by various governmental authorities. For instance, we must comply with requirements of the FDA and requirements from regulatory agencies in our other markets with respect to the research, development, manufacture, quality, safety, labeling, sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and promotion of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with regulations of the FDA and other regulators could result in a range of fines, penalties, disgorgement, unanticipated compliance expenditures, rejection or delay in approval of applications, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, our inability to sell products, the return by customers of our products, suspension of the applicable regulator’s review of our submissions, enforcement actions, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecution. Under certain circumstances, the regulators may also have the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. In addition to the drug approval process, government agencies also regulate the facilities and operational procedures that we use to manufacture our products. We must register our facilities with the FDA and other similar regulators in other countries. Products manufactured in our facilities must be made in a manner consistent with current good manufacturing practices or similar standards in each territory in which we manufacture. Compliance with such regulations requires substantial expenditures of time, money, and effort in such areas as production and quality control to ensure compliance. The FDA and other agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities for compliance. Regulatory approval to manufacture a drug is site-specific. Failure to comply with good manufacturing practices and other regulatory standards at one of our or our partners’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facilities could result in an adverse action brought by the FDA or other regulatory bodies, which could include fines, penalties, disgorgement, unanticipated compliance expenditures, rejection or delay in approval of applications, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, our inability to sell products, the return by customers of our products, suspension of the applicable regulator’s review of our submissions, enforcement actions, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecution or other adverse actions. 70Table of ContentsIf any regulatory body were to delay, withhold, or withdraw approval of an application, or require a recall or other adverse product action, or require one of our manufacturing facilities to cease or limit production, our business could be adversely affected. Delay and cost in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approval to manufacture at a different facility also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.Although we have internal regulatory compliance programs and policies, there is no guarantee that these programs and policies, as currently designed, will meet regulatory agency standards in the future or will prevent instances of non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, despite our efforts at compliance, from time to time we receive notices of manufacturing and quality-related observations following inspections by regulatory authorities around the world, as well as official agency correspondence regarding compliance. We may receive similar observations and correspondence in the future. If we were deemed to be deficient in any significant way, or if any of the noted risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price could be materially affected.We are subject to various federal, state and local laws regulating working conditions, as well as environmental protection laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of materials into the environment and those related to climate change. If changes to such environmental laws and regulations are made in the future that require significant changes in our operations, or if we engage in the development and manufacturing of new products requiring new or different environmental or other controls, or if we are found to have violated any applicable rules, we may be required to expend significant funds. Such changes, delays, and/or suspensions of activities or the occurrence of any of the above risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.THE USE OF LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LEGISLATIVE STRATEGIES BY BOTH BRAND AND GENERIC COMPETITORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO “AUTHORIZED GENERICS” AND REGULATORY PETITIONS, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PROPOSED AND NEW LEGISLATION, MAY INCREASE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OR MARKETING OF OUR GENERIC PRODUCTS, COULD DELAY OR PREVENT SUCH INTRODUCTION, AND COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR PROFIT.Our competitors, both branded and generic, often pursue strategies to prevent, delay, or eliminate competition from generic alternatives to branded products. These strategies include, but are not limited to:•entering into agreements whereby other generic companies will begin to market an authorized generic, a generic equivalent of a branded product, at the same time or after generic competition initially enters the market;•launching a generic version of their own branded product prior to or at the same time or after generic competition initially enters the market;•filing petitions with the FDA or other regulatory bodies seeking to prevent or delay approvals, including timing the filings so as to thwart generic competition by causing delays of our product approvals;•seeking to establish regulatory and legal obstacles that would make it more difficult to demonstrate bioequivalence or to meet other requirements for approval, and/or to prevent regulatory agency review of applications, such as through the establishment of patent linkage (laws and regulations barring the issuance of regulatory approvals prior to patent expiration); •initiating legislative or other efforts to limit the substitution of generic versions of brand pharmaceuticals;•filing suits for patent infringement and other claims that may delay or prevent regulatory approval, manufacture, and/or scale of generic products;•introducing “next-generation” products prior to the expiration of market exclusivity for the reference product, which often materially reduces the demand for the generic or the reference product for which we seek regulatory approval;•persuading regulatory bodies to withdraw the approval of brand name drugs for which the patents are about to expire and converting the market to another product of the brand company on which longer patent protection exists; 71Table of Contents•obtaining extensions of market exclusivity by conducting clinical trials of brand drugs in pediatric populations or by other methods; and•seeking to obtain new patents on drugs for which patent protection is about to expire.In the U.S., some companies have lobbied Congress for amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act that would give them additional advantages over generic competitors. For example, although the term of a company’s drug patent can be extended to reflect a portion of the time a new drug application (an “NDA”) is under regulatory review, some companies have proposed extending the patent term by a full year for each year spent in clinical trials rather than the one-half year that is currently permitted.If proposals like these in the U.S., Europe, or in other countries where we or our partners and suppliers operate were to become effective, or if any other actions by our competitors and other third parties to prevent or delay activities necessary to the approval, manufacture, or distribution of our products are successful, our entry into the market and our ability to generate revenues associated with new products may be delayed, reduced, or eliminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER, OUR FUTURE REVENUE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.Our future revenues and profitability will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully develop, license, or otherwise acquire and commercialize new generic and patent or statutorily protected pharmaceutical products in a timely manner. Product development is inherently risky, especially for new drugs for which safety and efficacy have not been established and the market is not yet proven as well as for complex generic drugs and biosimilars. Likewise, product licensing involves inherent risks, including among others uncertainties due to matters that may affect the achievement of milestones, as well as the possibility of contractual disagreements with regard to whether the supply of product meets certain specifications or terms such as license scope or termination rights. The development and commercialization process, particularly with regard to new and complex drugs, also requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. We, or a partner, may not be successful in commercializing any of such products on a timely basis, if at all, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.Before any prescription drug product, including generic drug products, can be marketed, marketing authorization approval is required by the relevant regulatory authorities and/or national regulatory agencies (for example the FDA in the U.S. and the European Medicine Agency in the EU). The process of obtaining regulatory approval to manufacture and market new and generic pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time consuming, costly, and unpredictable. Outside the U.S., the approval process may be more or less rigorous, depending on the country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the U.S. Bioequivalence studies conducted in one country may not be accepted in other countries, the requirements for approval may differ among countries, and the approval of a pharmaceutical product in one country does not necessarily mean that the product will be approved in another country. We, or a partner or supplier, may be unable to obtain requisite approvals on a timely basis, or at all, for new generic or branded products that we may develop, license or otherwise acquire. Moreover, if we obtain regulatory approval for a drug, it may be limited with respect to the indicated uses and delivery methods for which the drug may be marketed, which could in turn restrict our potential market for the drug. Also, for products pending approval, we may obtain raw materials or produce batches of inventory to be used in efficacy and bioequivalence testing, as well as in anticipation of the product’s launch. In the event that regulatory approval is denied or delayed, we could be exposed to the risk of this inventory becoming obsolete.The approval process for generic pharmaceutical products often results in the relevant regulatory agency granting final approval to a number of generic pharmaceutical products at the time a patent claim for a corresponding branded product or other market exclusivity expires. This often forces us to face immediate competition when we introduce a generic product into the market. Additionally, further generic approvals often continue to be granted for a given product subsequent to the initial launch of the generic product. These circumstances generally result in significantly lower prices, as well as reduced margins, for generic products compared to branded products. New generic market entrants generally cause continued price, margin, and sales erosion over the generic product life cycle.In the U.S., the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a period of 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity for each abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) applicant that is first-to-file an ANDA containing a certification of invalidity, non-infringement or unenforceability related to a patent listed with respect to a reference drug product, commonly referred to as a Paragraph IV certification. During this exclusivity period, which under certain circumstances may be required to be shared with other applicable ANDA sponsors with timely Paragraph IV certifications, the FDA cannot grant final approval to other ANDA sponsors holding applications for the same generic equivalent. If an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification is successful 72Table of Contentsand the applicant is awarded exclusivity, the applicant generally enjoys higher market share, net revenues, and gross margin for that generic product. However, our ability to obtain 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity may be dependent upon our ability to obtain FDA approval or tentative approval within an applicable time period of the FDA’s acceptance of our ANDA. If we are unable to obtain approval or tentative approval within that time period, we may risk forfeiture of such marketing exclusivity. Even if we obtain FDA approval for our generic drug products, if we are not the first ANDA applicant to challenge a listed patent for such a product, we may lose significant advantages to a competitor that filed its ANDA containing such a challenge. The same would be true in situations where we are required to share our exclusivity period with other ANDA sponsors with Paragraph IV certifications. In Europe and other countries and regions, there is no exclusivity period for the first generic product. The EMA or national regulatory agencies may grant marketing authorizations to any number of generics. In addition, in other jurisdictions outside the U.S., we may face similar regulatory requirements and constraints. If we are unable to navigate our products through all of the regulatory requirements we face in a timely manner, or upon the occurrence of any of the other above risks, there could be an adverse effect on our product introduction plans, business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE EXPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THAT MAY NOT LEAD TO SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS.Much of our development effort is focused on technically difficult-to-formulate products and/or products that require advanced manufacturing technology, including our generic biologics program and respiratory platform. We conduct R&D primarily to enable us to manufacture and market approved pharmaceuticals in accordance with applicable regulations. We also partner with third parties to develop products. Typically, research expenses related to the development of innovative or complex compounds and the filing of marketing authorization applications for innovative and complex compounds (such as NDAs and biosimilar applications in the U.S.) are significantly greater than those expenses associated with the development of and filing of marketing authorization applications for most generic products (such as ANDAs in the U.S. and abridged applications in Europe). As we and our partners continue to develop new and/or complex products, our research expenses will likely increase. Because of the inherent risk associated with R&D efforts in our industry, including the high cost and uncertainty of conducting clinical trials (where required) particularly with respect to new and/or complex drugs, our, or a partner’s, research and development expenditures may not result in the successful introduction of new pharmaceutical products approved by the relevant regulatory bodies. Also, after we submit a marketing authorization application for a new compound or generic product, the relevant regulatory authority may change standards and/or request that we conduct additional studies or evaluations and, as a result, we may incur approval delays as well as total R&D costs to develop a particular product in excess of what we anticipated. Finally, we cannot be certain that any investment made in developing products will be recovered, even if we are successful in commercialization. To the extent that we expend significant resources on R&D efforts and are not able, ultimately, to introduce successful new and/or complex products as a result of those efforts, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.EVEN AFTER OUR PRODUCTS RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL, SUCH PRODUCTS MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED LEVELS OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE.Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for our pharmaceutical products, generic or branded, the success of those products is dependent upon market acceptance. Levels of market acceptance for our products could be impacted by several factors, including but not limited to:•the availability of alternative products from our competitors;•the price of our products relative to that of our competitors;•the timing of our market entry;•the ability to market our products effectively to the different levels in the distribution chain;•other competitor actions; and•the continued acceptance of and/or reimbursement for our products by government and private formularies and/or third party payors.73Table of ContentsAdditionally, studies of the proper utilization, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceutical products are being conducted by the industry, government agencies, and others. Such studies, which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques, can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed as well as future products. In some cases, studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of product marketing or other risk management programs, such as the need for a patient registry, as well as delays in approvals. The occurrence of any of the above risks could adversely affect our profitability, business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.THE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF BIOSIMILAR PRODUCTS POSES UNIQUE RISKS, AND OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTRODUCE BIOSIMILAR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.We and our partners and suppliers are actively working to develop and commercialize biosimilar products - that is, a biological product that is highly similar to an already approved biological product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and the approved biological product in terms of safety, purity and potency. However, significant uncertainty remains concerning both the regulatory pathway in the U.S. and in other countries to obtain regulatory approval of biosimilar products, and the commercial pathway to successfully market and sell such products. In particular, although recently enacted legislation authorizes the FDA to create a regulatory pathway for the review and approval of such products, significant uncertainty remains concerning the establishment of this regulatory regime, as well as the commercial steps necessary to successfully market and sell such products. The costs of development and approval, along with the likelihood of success for our biosimilar candidates, however, will be dependent upon any final regulations issued by the FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities.Moreover, biosimilar products will likely be subject to extensive patent clearances and patent infringement litigation, which could delay or prevent the commercial launch of a product for many years. If we are unable to obtain FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authority approval for our products, as needed, such products may not be commercially successful and may not generate profits in amounts that are sufficient to offset the amount invested to obtain such approvals. Market success of biosimilar products will depend on demonstrating to regulators, patients, physicians and payors (such as insurance companies) that such products are safe and efficacious compared to other existing products yet offer a more competitive price or other benefit over existing therapies. In addition, the development and manufacture of biosimilars pose unique risks related to the supply of the materials needed to manufacture biosimilars. Access to and the supply of necessary biological materials may be limited, and government regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. Depending on the outcome of the foregoing risks, we may not be able to generate future sales of biosimilar products in certain jurisdictions and may not realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in the development, manufacture and sale of such products. If our development efforts do not result in the development and timely approval of biosimilar products or if such products, once developed and approved, are not commercially successful, or upon the occurrence of any of the above risks, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price could be materially adversely affected.OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF US, OUR BRANDS, AND THE SAFETY AND QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY NEGATIVE PUBLICITY OR FINDINGS.Market perceptions of us are very important to our business, especially market perceptions of our company and brands and the safety and quality of our products. If we, our partners and suppliers, or our brands suffer from negative publicity, or if any of our products or similar products which other companies distribute are subject to market withdrawal or recall or are proven to be, or are claimed to be, ineffective or harmful to consumers, then this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price. Also, because we are dependent on market perceptions, negative publicity associated with product quality, patient illness, or other adverse effects resulting from, or perceived to be resulting from, our products, or our partners’ and suppliers’ manufacturing facilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.THE ILLEGAL DISTRIBUTION AND SALE BY THIRD PARTIES OF COUNTERFEIT VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS OR OF DIVERTED OR STOLEN PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REPUTATION AND OUR BUSINESS.The pharmaceutical drug supply has been increasingly challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet.Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products that do not meet the rigorous manufacturing and testing standards that our products undergo. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and 74Table of Contentscan be potentially life-threatening. Counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances, the wrong dose of API or no API at all. However, to distributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version.Reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit drugs or increased levels of counterfeiting could materially affect patient confidence in the authentic product. It is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit products will mistakenly be attributed to the authentic product. In addition, unauthorized diversions of products or thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants, or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation, and our business.Public loss of confidence in the integrity of pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting, diversion, or theft could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.OUR COMPETITORS, INCLUDING BRANDED PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, AND/OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES, MAY ALLEGE THAT WE AND/OR OUR SUPPLIERS ARE INFRINGING UPON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING IN AN “AT RISK LAUNCH” SITUATION, IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO LAUNCH A PRODUCT, AND/OR OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE MARKETING A PRODUCT, AND/OR FORCING US TO EXPEND SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES IN RESULTING LITIGATION, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH IS UNCERTAIN.Companies that produce branded pharmaceutical products and other patent holders routinely bring litigation against entities selling or seeking regulatory approval to manufacture and market generic forms of their branded products, as well as other entities involved in the manufacture, supply, testing, marketing, and other aspects relating to active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished pharmaceutical products. These companies and other patent holders allege patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the basis for filing suit against an applicant for a generic product license as well as others who may be involved in some aspect of the research, production, distribution, or testing process. Litigation often involves significant expense and can delay or prevent introduction or sale of our generic products. If patents are held valid and infringed by our products in a particular jurisdiction, we and/or our supplier(s) or partner(s) would, unless we or the supplier(s) or partner(s) could obtain a license from the patent holder, need to cease manufacturing and other activities, including but not limited to selling in that jurisdiction, and may need to surrender or withdraw the product, or destroy existing stock in that jurisdiction.There also may be situations where we use our business judgment and decide to manufacture, market, and/or sell products, directly or through third parties, notwithstanding the fact that allegations of patent infringement(s) have not been finally resolved by the courts (i.e., an “at-risk launch”). The risk involved in doing so can be substantial because the remedies available to the owner of a patent for infringement may include, among other things, damages measured by the profits lost by the patent holder and not necessarily by the profits earned by the infringer. In the case of a finding by a court of willful infringement, the definition of which is subjective, such damages may be increased by an additional 200% in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S. Moreover, because of the discount pricing typically involved with bioequivalent (generic) products, patented branded products generally realize a substantially higher profit margin than bioequivalent products. An adverse decision in a case such as this or in other similar litigation, or a judicial order preventing us or our suppliers and partners from manufacturing, marketing, selling, and/or other activities necessary to the manufacture and distribution of our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.IF WE OR ANY PARTNER OR SUPPLIER FAIL TO OBTAIN OR ADEQUATELY PROTECT OR ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, THEN WE COULD LOSE REVENUE UNDER OUR LICENSING AGREEMENTS OR LOSE SALES TO GENERIC COPIES OF OUR BRANDED PRODUCTS.Our success, particularly in our specialty and branded businesses, depends in part on our or any partner’s or supplier’s ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents, and protect trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property and proprietary information. Our ability to commercialize any branded product successfully will largely depend upon our or any partner’s or supplier’s ability to obtain and maintain patents and trademarks of sufficient scope to lawfully prevent third-parties from developing and/or marketing infringing products. In the absence of intellectual property or other protection, competitors may adversely affect our branded products business by independently developing and/or marketing substantially equivalent products. It is also possible that we could incur substantial costs if we are required to initiate litigation against others to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.We have filed patent applications covering the composition of, methods of making, and/or methods of using, our branded products and branded product candidates. We may not be issued patents based on patent applications already filed or that we file in the future. Further, due to other factors that affect patentability, and if patents are issued, they may be insufficient in scope to cover or otherwise protect our branded products. Patents are national in scope and therefore the issuance of a patent in 75Table of Contentsone country does not ensure the issuance of a patent in any other country. Furthermore, the patent position of companies in the pharmaceutical industry generally involves complex legal and factual questions and has been and remains the subject of significant litigation. Legal standards relating to scope and validity of patent claims are evolving and may differ in various countries. Any patents we have obtained, or obtain in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Moreover, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or any other governmental agency may commence opposition or interference proceedings involving, or consider other challenges to, our patents or patent applications. In addition, branded products often have market viability based upon the goodwill of the product name, which typically benefits from trademark protection. Our branded products may therefore also be subject to risks related to the loss of trademark or patent protection or to competition from generic or other branded products. Challenges can come from other businesses or governments, and governments could require compulsory licensing of this intellectual property.Any challenge to, or invalidation or circumvention of, our intellectual property (including patents or patent applications and trademark protection) would be costly, would require significant time and attention of our management, and could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.BOTH OUR GENERICS AND SPECIALTY BUSINESSES DEVELOP, FORMULATE, MANUFACTURE, OR IN-LICENSE AND MARKET PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO ECONOMIC RISKS RELATING TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, COMPETITION, AND MARKET UNPREDICTABILITY.Our products may be subject to the following risks, among others:•limited patent life, or the loss of patent protection;•competition from generic or other branded products;•reductions in reimbursement rates by government and other third-party payors;•importation by consumers;•product liability;•drug research and development risks; and•unpredictability with regard to establishing a market.In addition, developing and commercializing branded products is generally more costly than generic products. If such business expenditures do not ultimately result in the launch of commercially successful brand products, or if any of the risks above were to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE FACE VIGOROUS COMPETITION FROM OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS THAT THREATENS THE COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE AND PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS.The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. We face competition from many U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers, some of whom are significantly larger than we are. Our competitors may be able to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our own for many reasons, including but not limited to the possibility that they may have:•proprietary processes or delivery systems;•larger or more productive research and development and marketing staffs;•larger or more efficient production capabilities in a particular therapeutic area;•more experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials;•more products; or•more experience in developing new drugs and greater financial resources, particularly with regard to manufacturers of branded products.76Table of ContentsThe occurrence of any of the above risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.We also face increasing competition from lower-cost generic products and other branded products. Certain of our products are not protected by patent rights or have limited patent life and will soon lose patent protection. Loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes, reducing sales of that product. As a result, sales of many of these products may decline or stop growing over time. Various factors may result in the sales of certain of our products, particularly those acquired in the EPD Transaction, declining faster than has been projected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time in various jurisdictions for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. Any such proposal that is enacted into law could worsen this negative effect on our sales and, potentially, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or ordinary share price. Competitors’ products may also be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or better performance features than ours. We cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of competitors’ products. In addition, our sales may suffer as a result of changes in consumer demand for our products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products by competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRODUCTS MAY REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, GROSS PROFIT, OR NET EARNINGS FROM TIME TO TIME.Sales of a limited number of our products from time to time represent a significant portion of our revenues, gross profit, and net earnings. For the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, Mylan’s top ten products in terms of sales, in the aggregate, represented approximately 27% and 30%, respectively, of its consolidated total revenues. It is uncertain whether this trend will continue after the EPD Transaction. If the volume or pricing of our largest selling products declines in the future, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price could be materially adversely affected.A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES IS DERIVED FROM SALES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. A significant portion of our revenues are derived from sales to a limited number of customers. If we were to experience a significant reduction in or loss of business with one or more such customers, or if one or more such customers were to experience difficulty in paying us on a timely basis, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price could be materially adversely affected.During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, Mylan Inc.’s consolidated third party net sales to Cardinal Health, Inc. were approximately 12%, 15% and 14%, respectively; Mylan Inc.’s consolidated third party net sales to McKesson Corporation were approximately 19%, 14% and 13%, respectively; and Mylan Inc.’s consolidated third party net sales to AmeriSourceBergen Corporation were approximately 13%, 10% and 7%, respectively, of consolidated net sales. It is uncertain whether this trend will continue after the EPD Transaction.OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR COLLABORATION PARTNERS AND SUPPLIERS.We have entered into strategic alliances with partners and suppliers to develop, manufacture, market and/or distribute certain products, and/or certain components of our products, in various markets. We commit substantial effort, funds and other resources to these various collaborations. There is a risk that the investments made by us in these collaborative arrangements will not generate financial returns. While we believe our relationships with our partners and suppliers generally are successful, disputes or conflicting priorities and regulatory or legal intervention could be a source of delay or uncertainty as to the expected benefits of the collaboration. A failure or inability of our partners or suppliers to fulfill their collaboration obligations, or the occurrence of any of the risks above, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE MAY EXPERIENCE DECLINES IN THE SALES VOLUME AND PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS AS THE RESULT OF THE CONTINUING TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN CUSTOMER GROUPS, SUCH AS THE WHOLESALE DRUG DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL PHARMACY INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS THE EMERGENCE OF LARGE BUYING GROUPS.77Table of ContentsA significant amount of our sales are to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers and retail drug chains. These customers represent an essential part of the distribution chain of generic pharmaceutical products. Drug wholesalers and retail drug chains have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, significant consolidation. This consolidation may result in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage and, consequently, increasing the product pricing pressures facing our business. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions potentially enable those groups to attempt to extract price discounts on our products. The occurrence of any of the above risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE DEPEND TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS FOR RAW MATERIALS, PARTICULARLY THE CHEMICAL COMPOUND(S) THAT CONSTITUTE THE ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS THAT WE USE TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN FINISHED GOODS, INCLUDING CERTAIN CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. THESE THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAY EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN OR INABILITY TO SUPPLY US WITH RAW MATERIALS NECESSARY TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND/OR MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS.We purchase certain API (i.e., the chemical compounds that produce the desired therapeutic effect in our products) and other materials and supplies that we use in our manufacturing operations, as well as certain finished products, from many different foreign and domestic suppliers.In certain cases, we have listed only one supplier in our applications with regulatory agencies, and there is no guarantee that we will always have timely and sufficient access to a critical raw material or finished product supplied by third parties, even when we have more than one supplier. An interruption in the supply of a single-sourced or any other raw material, including the relevant API, or in the supply of finished product, could cause our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price to be materially adversely affected. In addition, our manufacturing and supply capabilities could be adversely impacted by quality deficiencies in the products which our suppliers provide, or at their manufacturing facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.We utilize controlled substances in certain of our current products and products in development, and therefore must meet the requirements of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and the related regulations administered by the Drug Enforcement Agency (the “DEA”) in the U.S., as well as similar laws in other countries where we operate. These laws relate to the manufacture, shipment, storage, sale, and use of controlled substances. The DEA and other regulatory agencies limit the availability of the active ingredients used in certain of our current products and products in development and, as a result, our procurement quota of these active ingredients may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. We must annually apply to the DEA and other regulatory agencies for procurement quota in order to obtain these substances. Any delay or refusal by the DEA or such regulatory agencies in establishing our procurement quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, or could cause trade inventory disruptions for those products that have already been launched, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.THE SUPPLY OF API INTO EUROPE MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY RECENT REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION.Since July 2, 2013, all API imported into the EU has needed to be certified as complying with the good manufacturing practice standards established by the EU, as stipulated by the International Conference for Harmonization. These new regulations place the certification requirement on the regulatory bodies of the exporting countries. Accordingly, the national regulatory authorities of each exporting country must: (i) ensure that all manufacturing plants within their borders that export API into the EU comply with EU manufacturing standards and (ii) for each API exported, present a written document confirming that the exporting plant conforms to EU manufacturing standards. The imposition of this responsibility on the governments of the nations exporting an API may cause delays in delivery or shortages of an API necessary to manufacture our products, as certain governments may not be willing or able to comply with the regulation in a timely fashion, or at all. A shortage in API may prevent us from manufacturing, or cause us to have to cease manufacture of, certain products, or to incur costs and delays to qualify other suppliers to substitute for those API manufacturers unable to export. The occurrence of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.78Table of ContentsWE HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND CERTAIN THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS PRODUCING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR PRODUCTS, SOME OF WHICH REQUIRE A HIGHLY EXACTING AND COMPLEX MANUFACTURING PROCESS.A substantial portion of our capacity, as well as our current production, is attributable to a limited number of manufacturing facilities and certain third party suppliers. A significant disruption at any one of such facilities within our internal or third party supply chain, even on a short-term basis, whether due to a labor strike, failure to reach acceptable agreement with labor and unions, adverse quality or compliance observation, other regulatory action, infringement of intellectual property rights, act of God, civil or political unrest, export or import restrictions, or other events could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis and could, among other consequences, subject us to exposure to claims from customers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.In addition, the manufacture of some of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including among others equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters, power outages, labor unrest, and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause, and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. If we or one of our suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.OUR REPORTING AND PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN U.S. FEDERAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, ARE COMPLEX AND OFTEN INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE DECISIONS THAT COULD CHANGE AS A RESULT OF NEW BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCES, NEW REGULATIONS OR AGENCY GUIDANCE, OR ADVICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL. ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THOSE OBLIGATIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO INVESTIGATION, PENALTIES, AND SANCTIONS.Federal laws regarding reporting and payment obligations with respect to a pharmaceutical company’s participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, are complex. Because our processes for calculating applicable government prices and the judgments involved in making these calculations involve subjective decisions and complex methodologies, these calculations are subject to risk of errors and differing interpretations. In addition, they are subject to review and challenge by the applicable governmental agencies, and it is possible that such reviews could result in changes that may have material adverse legal, regulatory, or economic consequences. Pharmaceutical manufacturers that participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, such as Mylan, are required to report certain pricing data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This data includes the Average Manufacturer Price (“AMP”) for each of the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. CMS calculates a type of U.S. federal ceiling on reimbursement rates to pharmacies for multiple source drugs under the Medicaid program, known as the federal upper limit (“FUL”). The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“PPACA”) includes a provision requiring CMS to use the weighted average AMP for pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent multiple source drugs to calculate FULs, instead of the other pricing data CMS previously used. The provision was effective October 1, 2010; however, AMP-based FULs have not yet been published by CMS, except in draft form, and have not been implemented to set the federal ceiling on reimbursement rates for multiple source drugs. Although weighted average AMP-based FULs would not reveal Mylan’s individual AMP, publishing a weighted average AMP available to customers and the public at large could negatively affect our commercial price negotiations.In addition, a number of state and federal government agencies are conducting investigations of manufacturers’ reporting practices with respect to Average Wholesale Prices (“AWP”). The government has alleged that reporting of inflated AWP has led to excessive payments for prescription drugs, and we may be named as a defendant in actions relating to pharmaceutical pricing issues and whether allegedly improper actions by pharmaceutical manufacturers led to excessive payments by Medicare and/or Medicaid.Any governmental agencies or authorities that have commenced, or may commence, an investigation of us relating to the sales, marketing, pricing, quality, or manufacturing of pharmaceutical products could seek to impose, based on a claim of violation of anti-fraud and false claims laws or otherwise, civil and/or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties, and possible exclusion from federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Some of the applicable laws may impose liability even in the absence of specific intent to defraud. Furthermore, should there be ambiguity with regard to how to properly calculate and report payments - and even in the absence of any such ambiguity - a governmental authority may take a 79Table of Contentsposition contrary to a position we have taken, and may impose or pursue civil and/or criminal sanctions. Any failure to comply with the above laws and regulations, and any such penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE MAY EXPERIENCE REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVELS OF REIMBURSEMENT FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, HMOS, OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY PAYORS. IN ADDITION, THE USE OF TENDER SYSTEMS AND OTHER FORMS OF PRICE CONTROL COULD REDUCE PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR REDUCE OUR MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.Various governmental authorities (including, among others, the U.K. National Health Service and the German statutory health insurance scheme) and private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs in the U.S., provide reimbursements or subsidies to consumers for the cost of certain pharmaceutical products. Demand for our products depends in part on the extent to which such reimbursement is available. In the U.S., third-party payors increasingly challenge the pricing of pharmaceutical products. This trend and other trends toward the growth of HMOs, managed health care, and legislative health care reform create significant uncertainties regarding the future levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products. Further, any reimbursement may be reduced in the future to the point that market demand for our products and/or our profitability declines. Such a decline could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.In addition, a number of markets in which we operate have implemented or may implement tender systems or other forms of price controls for generic pharmaceuticals in an effort to lower prices. Under such tender systems, manufacturers submit bids which establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products. Upon winning the tender, the winning company will receive a preferential reimbursement for a period of time. The tender system often results in companies underbidding one another by proposing low pricing in order to win the tender. Certain other countries may consider the implementation of a tender system or other forms of price controls. Even if a tender system is ultimately not implemented, the anticipation of such could result in price reductions. Failing to win tenders, or the implementation of similar systems or other forms of price controls in other markets leading to further price declines, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY PROGRAMS THAT MAY INFLUENCE PRICES OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.Current or future U.S. federal, U.S. state or other countries’ laws and regulations may influence the prices of drugs and, therefore, could adversely affect the prices that we receive for our products. For example, programs in existence in certain states in the U.S. seek to broadly set prices, within those states, through the regulation and administration of the sale of prescription drugs. Expansion of these programs, in particular state Medicare and/or Medicaid programs, or changes required in the way in which Medicare and/or Medicaid rebates are calculated under such programs, could adversely affect the prices we receive for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.In order to control expenditure on pharmaceuticals, most member states in the EU regulate the pricing of products and, in some cases, limit the range of different forms of pharmaceuticals available for prescription by national health services. These controls can result in considerable price differences between member states.Several countries in which we operate have implemented, or plan to or may implement, government mandated price reductions and/or other controls. When such price cuts occur, pharmaceutical companies have generally experienced significant declines in revenues and profitability and uncertainties continue to exist within the market after the price decrease. Such price reductions or controls could have an adverse effect on our business, and as uncertainties are resolved or if other countries in which we operate enact similar measures, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.In recent years, there have been numerous initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for, the availability of and reimbursement for, health care services in the U.S., and it is likely that Congress and state legislatures and health agencies will continue to focus on health care reform in the future. The PPACA and The Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872), which amends the PPACA (collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”), were signed into law in March 2010. While the Health Reform Laws may increase the number of patients who have 80Table of Contentsinsurance coverage for our products, they also include provisions such as the assessment of a pharmaceutical manufacturer fee and an increase in the amount of rebates that manufacturers pay for coverage of their drugs by Medicaid programs.We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state health care legislation. The Health Reform Laws and further changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.Additionally, we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. In the EU and some other international markets, the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and/or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored health care system. These systems of price regulations may lead to inconsistent and lower prices. Within the EU and in other countries, the availability of our products in some markets at lower prices undermines our sales in other markets with higher prices. Additionally, certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed. Thus, our inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may also impair our ability to obtain acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets, and may create the opportunity for third party cross border trade.If significant additional reforms are made to the U.S. health care system, or to the health care systems of other markets in which we operate, those reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CERTAIN GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND MAY EXPERIENCE UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS OR INQUIRIES.We are or may be involved in various legal proceedings and certain government inquiries or investigations, including, but not limited to, patent infringement, product liability, antitrust matters, breach of contract, and claims involving Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursements, or laws relating to sales, marketing, and pricing practices, some of which are described in our periodic reports, that involve claims for, or the possibility of, fines and penalties involving substantial amounts of money or other relief, including but not limited to civil or criminal fines and penalties and exclusion from participation in various government health-care-related programs. With respect to government antitrust enforcement and private plaintiff litigation of so-called “pay for delay” patent settlements, large verdicts, settlements or government fines are possible, especially in the U.S. and EU. If any of these legal proceedings or inquiries were to result in an adverse outcome, the impact could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.With respect to product liability, we maintain a combination of self-insurance (including through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary) and commercial insurance to protect against and manage a portion of the risks involved in conducting our business. Although we carry insurance, we believe that no reasonable amount of insurance can fully protect against all such risks because of the potential liability inherent in the business of producing pharmaceuticals for human consumption. Emerging developments in the U.S. legal landscape relative to the liability of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers for certain product liabilities claims could increase our exposure litigation costs and damages. To the extent that a loss occurs, depending on the nature of the loss and the level of insurance coverage maintained, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.In addition, in limited circumstances, entities that we acquired are party to litigation in matters under which we are, or may be, entitled to indemnification by the previous owners. Even in the case of indemnification, there are risks inherent in such indemnities and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will receive the full benefits of such indemnification, or that we will not experience an adverse result in a matter that is not indemnified, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.We have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under Section 45 of the Code. Our ability to claim tax credits under Section 45 of the Code depends upon the operations in which we have invested satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in Section 45 of the Code. These include, among others, the emissions reduction, “qualifying technology”, and “placed-in-service” requirements of Section 45 of the Code, as well as the requirement that at least one of the operations’ owners qualifies as a “producer” of refined coal. While we have received some degree of confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claim these tax credits, the IRS could ultimately determine that the operations have not satisfied, or have not continued to satisfy, the conditions set forth in Section 45 of the Code. Additionally, Congress could modify or repeal Section 45 of the Code and remove the tax credits retroactively.81Table of ContentsIn addition, Section 45 of the Code contains phase out provisions based upon the market price of coal, such that, if the price of coal rises to specified levels, we could lose some or all of the tax credits we expect to receive from these investments.Finally, when the price of natural gas or oil declines relative to that of coal, some utilities may choose to burn natural gas or oil instead of coal. Market demand for coal may also decline as a result of an economic slowdown and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity. If utilities burn less coal, eliminate coal in the production of electricity or are otherwise unable to operate for an extended period of time, the availability of the tax credits would also be reduced. The occurrence of any of the above risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INDEBTEDNESS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND PREVENT US FROM FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH INDEBTEDNESS. ANY REFINANCING OF THIS DEBT COULD BE AT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INTEREST RATES. OUR SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS COULD LEAD TO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES.Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including but not limited to:•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, challenges and opportunities, and changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements and other financing needs;•increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates in general because a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt.Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance and financial results, which will be subject, in part, to factors beyond our control, including interest rates and general economic, financial and business conditions. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness, we may need to refinance all or part of our existing indebtedness, borrow more money or sell securities or assets, some or all of which may not be available to us at acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. Although the terms of our senior credit agreement and our bond indentures allow us to incur additional debt, this is subject to certain limitations which may preclude us from incurring the amount of indebtedness we otherwise desire.In addition, if we incur additional debt, the risks described above could intensify. If global credit markets return to their recent levels of contraction, future debt financing may not be available to us when required or may not be available on acceptable terms, and as a result we may be unable to grow our business, take advantage of business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures or satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.Our credit facilities, senior unsecured notes, accounts receivable securitization facility, other outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur in the future impose, or may impose, significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, pay certain dividends, prepay other indebtedness, sell assets, incur certain liens, enter into agreements with our affiliates or restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, merge or consolidate. In addition, our Revolving Credit Agreement, 2014 Term Loan, and accounts receivable securitization facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios. A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios could result in a default under the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare our indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.82Table of ContentsTHE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS RELATED TO MYLAN INC.’S OUTSTANDING CASH CONVERTIBLE NOTES DUE 2015 (THE “CASH CONVERTIBLE NOTES”) WILL INCREASE IF OUR ORDINARY SHARE PRICE INCREASES. ALSO, MYLAN INC. HAS ENTERED INTO HEDGES AND WARRANT TRANSACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CASH CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN ORDER TO HEDGE SOME OF THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE POTENTIAL INCREASE OF INDEBTEDNESS AND SETTLEMENT VALUE. SUCH TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSUMMATED WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, MAINLY HIGHLY RATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ANY INCREASE IN INDEBTEDNESS, NET EXPOSURE RELATED TO THE RISK OR FAILURE OF ANY COUNTERPARTIES TO PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS, COULD HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON US, INCLUDING UNDER OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS.Prior to the consummation of the EPD Transaction, the value of the total amount of indebtedness related to Mylan Inc.’s Cash Convertible Notes was based on Mylan Inc.’s share price. In connection with the consummation of the EPD Transaction, we and Mylan Inc. executed a supplemental indenture that amended the indenture governing the Cash Convertible Notes so that, among other things, all relevant determinations for purposes of the cash conversion rights to which holders may be entitled from time to time in accordance with such indenture shall be made by reference to our ordinary shares. From and after the consummation of the EPD Transaction, the value of the total amount of indebtedness related to the Cash Convertible Notes is based on our ordinary share price. Under applicable accounting rules, the cash conversion feature that is a term of the Cash Convertible Notes must be recorded as a liability on our balance sheet and periodically marked to fair value. If our ordinary share price increases, the liability associated with the cash conversion feature would increase and, because this liability must be periodically marked to fair value on our balance sheet, the total amount of indebtedness related to the Cash Convertible Notes that is shown on our balance sheet would also increase. This could have adverse effects on us, including under any future debt agreements that contain covenants based on a definition of total indebtedness as defined under U.S. GAAP. As a result, we may not be able to comply with such covenants in the future, which could, among other things, restrict our ability to grow our business, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. The occurrence of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.In connection with the issuance of the Cash Convertible Notes, Mylan Inc. entered into note hedge and warrant transactions with certain financial institutions, each of which we refer to as a counterparty. In connection with the consummation of the EPD Transaction, the terms of the convertible note hedge were adjusted so that the cash settlement value is based on our ordinary shares. The terms of the warrant transactions were also adjusted so that, from and after the consummation of the EPD Transaction, Mylan Inc. may settle the obligations under the warrant transaction by delivering our ordinary shares and we guaranteed Mylan Inc.’s obligations under the warrant transactions. The convertible note hedge is comprised of purchased cash-settled call options that are expected to reduce Mylan Inc.’s exposure to potential cash payments required to be made by Mylan Inc. upon the cash conversion of the Cash Convertible Notes. Together, each of the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions are expected to provide us and Mylan Inc. with some protection against increases in our ordinary share price over the conversion price per share. However, there is no assurance that these transactions will remain in effect at all times. Also, although we believe the counterparties are highly rated financial institutions, there are no assurances that the counterparties will be able to perform their respective obligations under the agreements Mylan Inc. has with each of them. Any net exposure related to conversion of the Cash Convertible Notes or any failure of the counterparties to perform their obligations under the agreements Mylan Inc. has with them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE ENTER INTO VARIOUS AGREEMENTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS WHICH PERIODICALLY INCORPORATE PROVISIONS WHEREBY WE INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY TO THE AGREEMENT.In the normal course of business, we periodically enter into commercial, employment, legal settlement, and other agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions. In some but not all cases, we maintain insurance coverage which we believe will effectively mitigate our obligations under certain of these indemnification provisions. However, should our obligation under an indemnification provision exceed any applicable coverage or should coverage be denied, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price could be materially adversely affected.THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. ANY FUTURE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED OR NECESSARY REVISIONS TO PRIOR ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS OR ASSUMPTIONS OR CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS COULD LEAD TO A RESTATEMENT OR REVISION TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.83Table of ContentsThe Consolidated and Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in the periodic reports we file with the SEC are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any necessary revisions to prior estimates, judgments or assumptions could lead to a restatement. Furthermore, although we have recorded reserves for litigation related contingencies based on estimates of probable future costs, such litigation related contingencies could result in substantial further costs. Also, any new or revised accounting standards may require adjustments to previously issued financial statements. Any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE MUST MAINTAIN ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND BE ABLE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, TO PROVIDE AN ASSERTION AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH CONTROLS.Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports. We spend a substantial amount of management and other employee time and resources to comply with laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure. In the U.S., such regulations include the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, SEC regulations and the NASDAQ listing standards. In particular, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestation as to the effectiveness of these controls by our independent registered public accounting firm. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.As part of maintaining adequate internal controls, we need to timely and effectively implement any internal controls and procedures over the EPD Business that are necessary for us to satisfy the requirements of Section 404. We intend, to the extent necessary, to take appropriate measures to establish or enhance internal controls at the EPD Business so that we meet the requirements of Section 404 and are in position to include the EPD Business in our annual assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls as of December 31, 2015. However, it is possible that we may experience delays in implementing or be unable to implement necessary internal controls and procedures with respect to the EPD Business. In addition, in connection with the attestation process required of our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements. Accordingly, either we or our independent registered public accounting firm (or both) may conclude that our internal controls are ineffective because of a material weakness in internal controls at the EPD Business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.There is a limited carveout offered by the SEC staff in its published Frequently Asked Questions on Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Certification of Disclosure in Exchange Act Periodic Reports (revised September 24, 2007) which allows an acquired business to be excluded from a company’s assessment of its internal controls in circumstances where it is not possible to conduct an assessment of the acquired business’s internal controls and less than a year has passed since an acquisition. There can be no assurance that we will not need to avail ourselves of this relief. If we do exclude internal controls at the EPD Business from our assessment of internal controls pursuant to this carveout and we are otherwise able to conclude that our internal controls were effective as of December 31, 2015, there can be no assurance that our exclusion of internal controls at the EPD Business from our assessment will not be met with negative market reaction and will not have an adverse effect on our ordinary share price.OUR FUTURE SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL. LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD LEAD TO LOSS OF CUSTOMERS, BUSINESS DISRUPTION, AND A DECLINE IN REVENUES, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROGRESS OF PIPELINE PRODUCTS, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.84Table of ContentsIt is important that we attract and retain qualified personnel in order to develop and commercialize new products, manage our business, and compete effectively. Competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical industry is very intense. If we fail to attract and retain key scientific, technical, commercial, or management personnel, our business could be affected adversely. Additionally, while we have employment agreements with certain key employees in place, their employment for the duration of the agreement is not guaranteed. Current and prospective employees might also experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the consummation of the EPD Transaction, which might adversely affect our ability to retain key managers and other employees. If we are unsuccessful in retaining our key employees or enforcing certain post-employment contractual provisions such as confidentiality or non-competition, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.THE HISTORICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE EPD BUSINESS AND ITS COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RESULTS THAT THE EPD BUSINESS WOULD HAVE ACHIEVED IF OPERATED BY MYLAN.The historical information about the EPD Business contained in Mylan N.V.’s Registration Statement on Form S-4, as amended, which was declared effective by the SEC on December 23, 2014 (the “Registration Statement”) and Amendment No. 1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed on March 26, 2015 (the “Form 8-K/A”) refers to the EPD Business as operated by and integrated with Abbott. The combined financial statements of the EPD Business are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Abbott. Accordingly, the combined financial statements of the EPD Business do not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows that the EPD Business would have achieved if operated by Mylan. OUR ACTUAL FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT. The unaudited pro forma financial information contained in the Form 10-Q is presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of what our financial position or results of operations would have been had the EPD Transaction been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been derived from the consolidated financial statements of Mylan Inc. and the combined financial statements of the EPD Business and certain adjustments and assumptions have been made regarding Mylan after giving effect to the EPD Transaction. The information upon which these adjustments and assumptions have been made is preliminary, and these kinds of adjustments and assumptions are difficult to make with complete accuracy. For example, the unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect all costs that we are expected to incur in connection with the EPD Transaction. Accordingly, the actual financial position and results of our operations following the EPD Transaction may not be consistent with, or evident from, this unaudited pro forma financial information. In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the unaudited pro forma financial information may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price, including, among others, those described herein.THE EPD BUSINESS HAS NO HISTORY OPERATING IN THE STRUCTURE IN WHICH IT CURRENTLY OPERATES.Prior to the consummation of the EPD Transaction, the EPD Business had been operated by Abbott as part of its broader corporate organization. As a result of the EPD Business’s separation from Abbott, the EPD Business may encounter operational or financial difficulties that would not have occurred if the EPD Business continued operating in its former structure. For example, the EPD Business’s working capital and capital for general corporate purposes have historically been provided as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of Abbott. We may need to obtain additional financing for the EPD Business from lenders, public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships, or other arrangements. Similarly, the EPD Business’s combined financial statements reflect allocations of expenses from Abbott for corporate functions and may differ from the expenses the EPD Business would have incurred had the EPD Business been operated by us, and the EPD Business will need to make significant investments to replicate or outsource from other providers certain facilities, systems, infrastructure, and personnel to which it will no longer have access after closing and, for certain services to be provided pursuant to a transition services agreement entered into in connection with the consummation of the EPD Transaction (the “Transition Services Agreement”), the expiration of the Transition Services Agreement. In addition, as a result of the separation of the EPD Business from Abbott, other significant changes may occur in the EPD Business’s cost structure, management, financing, and business operations as a result of operating separately from Abbott that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.85Table of ContentsTHE EPD BUSINESS AND ABBOTT ARE INTERDEPENDENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN TRANSITION SERVICES AND MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND SHARE CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.Prior to the EPD Transaction, Abbott or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for the EPD Business, such as accounting, information technology, and finance, among others. After closing, Abbott is required to provide some of these functions to the EPD Business for a period of time pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. The EPD Business may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if it cannot transition effectively from Abbott’s existing operational systems and the transition services that support these functions as the EPD Business replaces these systems or integrates them with our systems. The EPD Business is dependent on Abbott providing these transition services, and we could be negatively impacted if Abbott fails to perform under the Transition Services Agreement. In addition, after closing, Abbott or one of its affiliates is required to manufacture products for the EPD Business, pursuant to certain agreements providing for, among other things, manufacturing and supply services. Disruptions or disagreements related to the third-party manufacturing relationship with Abbott could impair our ability to ship products to the market on a timely basis and could, among other consequences, subject us to exposure to claims from customers.  For a certain period of time after closing, Mylan has certain obligations to provide transition services to Abbott and to manufacture and supply products to Abbott. Accordingly, we may need to allocate resources to provide transition services or manufacturing capacity to Abbott in lieu of supplying products for the EPD Business, which could have a negative impact on us. In addition, Abbott or one of its affiliates owns registrations, including marketing authorizations, for certain products of the EPD Business in certain jurisdictions, and disagreements could arise regarding Abbott’s or our use of such registrations in the territory allocated to each party. The risks related to the foregoing relationships between us and Abbott could be exacerbated if Abbott fails to perform under the Business Transfer Agreement and related agreements or the EPD Business fails to have necessary systems and services in place when the obligations under the Business Transfer Agreement and related agreements expire, and such risks could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, INCLUDING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION DUE TO THE EPD TRANSACTION.Parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future, including customers and suppliers, may experience ongoing uncertainty associated with the EPD Transaction, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us. As a result, our business relationships may be subject to disruptions if customers, suppliers, and others attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. For example, certain customers and collaborators have contractual consent rights or termination rights that may have been triggered by a change of control or assignment of the rights and obligations of contracts that were transferred in the EPD Transaction. In addition, our contract manufacturing business could be impaired if existing or potential customers determine not to continue or initiate contract manufacturing relationships with us. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ENHANCING AND FURTHER DEVELOPING OUR GLOBAL ERP SYSTEMS AND ASSOCIATED BUSINESS APPLICATIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS IF WE ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES.We are enhancing and further developing our global ERP and other business critical information technology (“IT”) infrastructure systems and associated applications to provide more operating efficiencies and effective management of our business and financial operations. Such changes to ERP systems and related software, and other IT infrastructure carry risks such as cost overruns, project delays and business interruptions and delays. If we experience a material business interruption as a result of our ERP enhancements, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.WE ARE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OUR SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE FACE CERTAIN RISKS, INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY AND DATA LEAKAGE RISKS.Significant disruptions to our information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business. We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our 86Table of Contentsbusiness. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties, some of which are outside the U.S., including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of our third party vendors with whom we contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions. The size and complexity of our and our vendors’ systems and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them also makes them potentially vulnerable to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, partners or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. We and our vendors could be susceptible to third party attacks on our information security systems, which attacks are of ever increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including state and quasi-state actors, criminal groups, “hackers” and others. Maintaining the secrecy of this confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret information is important to our competitive business position. However, such information can be difficult to protect. While we have taken steps to protect such information and invested heavily in information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches in our systems or the unauthorized or inadvertent wrongful use or disclosure of confidential information that could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss, dissemination, or misuse of critical or sensitive information. A breach of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination, misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets, proprietary information, or other confidential information, whether as a result of theft, hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, or for any other cause, could enable others to produce competing products, use our proprietary technology or information, and/or adversely affect our business position. Further, any such interruption, security breach, loss or disclosure of confidential information, could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.THE EXPANSION OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS PRESENT NEW RISKS AND CHALLENGES.The inappropriate use of certain social media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information or the improper dissemination of material non-public information. In addition, negative posts or comments about us on any social networking web site could seriously damage our reputation. Further, the disclosure of non-public company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss as there might not be structured processes in place to secure and protect information. If our non-public sensitive information is disclosed or if our reputation is seriously damaged through social media, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD AFTER CONSUMMATION OF THE EPD TRANSACTION, WE MAY NOT BE PERMITTED TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE BENEFICIAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.For at least 90 days after closing of the EPD Transaction, we may not, without the consent of Abbott, issue, or agree to issue, any securities or equity rights, other than issuances of Mylan N.V. ordinary shares in connection with the exercise of outstanding equity rights and issuances of Mylan N.V. preferred shares to the Foundation pursuant to the exercise of the call option granted to the Foundation. The foregoing prohibitions could have the effect of delaying other strategic transactions and may, in some cases, make it impossible to pursue other strategic transactions that are available only for a limited time. Abbott has agreed to waive certain provisions of the Shareholder Agreement which restricted our ability, during the restricted period set forth in the Shareholder Agreement, to issue, or enter into any agreement or commitment to issue, equity in connection with mergers and acquisitions or to blackout Abbott’s registration rights in order to pursue mergers and acquisitions.Risks Related to the Perrigo ProposalIF COMPLETED, THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE INTENDED BENEFITS OR MAY DISRUPT MYLAN’S PLANS AND OPERATIONS.We cannot assure you that Mylan will be able to successfully integrate the business of Perrigo with the business of Mylan or otherwise realize the expected benefits of the acquisition, directly or indirectly (whether by way of the offer (and subsequent compulsory acquisition) or any other legal arrangement) of all or any portion of the ordinary shares of Perrigo outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) as of the consummation of such acquisition (the “Perrigo Acquisition”) and the issuance of Mylan ordinary shares to Perrigo shareholders as part of the consideration in the Perrigo Acquisition (the “Perrigo Share Issuance” and, together 87Table of Contentswith the Perrigo Acquisition, the “Perrigo Transaction”). Mylan’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Perrigo Transaction will depend, to a large extent, on Mylan’s ability to integrate Perrigo with the business of Mylan and realize the benefits of the combined business. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. Mylan’s business may be negatively impacted following the Perrigo Transaction if it is unable to effectively manage its expanded operations. The integration will require significant time and focus from management following the Perrigo Transaction and may divert attention from the day-to-day operations of the combined business. Additionally, consummation of the Perrigo Transaction could disrupt current plans and operations, which could delay the achievement of Mylan’s strategic objectives.The expected synergies and operating efficiencies of the Perrigo Transaction may not be fully realized, which could result in increased costs and have a material adverse effect on Mylan’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price. In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management’s attention, among other potential adverse consequences. The difficulties of combining the operations of the businesses include, among others:•the diversion of management’s attention to integration matters;•difficulties in achieving anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies, business opportunities, and growth prospects from combining Perrigo with Mylan;•difficulties in the integration of operations and systems, including enterprise resource planning systems;•difficulties in the integration of employees;•difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;•challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; and•challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel.Many of these factors will be outside of Mylan’s control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenues, and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could have a material adverse effect on Mylan’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price. In addition, even if the operations of Mylan and Perrigo are integrated successfully, Mylan may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the Perrigo Transaction, including the synergies, operating efficiencies, or sales or growth opportunities. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. All of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of the combined business, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Perrigo Transaction, and/or negatively impact the price of the ordinary shares of the combined business.IF GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT MYLAN RECORDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION BECOME IMPAIRED, MYLAN COULD HAVE TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT CHARGES AGAINST EARNINGS. In connection with the accounting for the Perrigo Transaction, Mylan expects to record a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. Under U.S. GAAP, Mylan must assess, at least annually, whether the value of goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired. Amortizing intangible assets will also be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. Any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on Mylan’s business, financial condition, results of operations, shareholder’s equity, and/or ordinary share price. MYLAN WILL NEED TO TIMELY AND EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT ITS INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER PERRIGO’S OPERATIONS AS REQUIRED UNDER THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002. Following the consummation of the Perrigo Transaction, Mylan will need to timely and effectively implement its own internal controls and procedures over Perrigo necessary for Mylan to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, including the requirements to provide an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and a report by Mylan’s independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. Mylan intends, to the extent necessary, to take appropriate measures to establish or implement an internal control environment at Perrigo so that Mylan meets the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, it is 88Table of Contentspossible that Mylan may experience delays in implementing or will be unable to implement the required internal financial reporting controls and procedures with respect to Perrigo. In addition, in connection with the attestation process required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 by Mylan’s independent registered public accounting firm, Mylan may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements or receiving a favorable attestation. If Mylan cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting, or if Mylan’s independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report, there could be a material adverse effect on Mylan’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.ALTHOUGH MYLAN CURRENTLY EXPECTS THAT THE OFFER AND COMPULSORY ACQUISITION WILL BE ACCRETIVE, THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION, ONCE COMPLETED, MAY NOT BE ACCRETIVE AND MAY CAUSE DILUTION TO MYLAN’S ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF MYLAN ORDINARY SHARES.Mylan currently expects that the Perrigo Transaction will be accretive to its adjusted annual earnings per share on a fully synergized basis. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates of synergies, which may change materially. Mylan could also encounter additional transaction-related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the Perrigo Transaction or the difficulty of managing a larger company. All of these factors could cause dilution to Mylan’s adjusted earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Perrigo Transaction and cause a decrease in the market price of Mylan ordinary shares. MYLAN WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTION-RELATED COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MYLAN’S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND/OR ORDINARY SHARE PRICE. Mylan will incur significant transaction costs relating to the Perrigo Transaction, including legal, accounting, financial advisory, regulatory, and other expenses which could have a material adverse effect on Mylan’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or ordinary share price. Many of these expenses are payable by Mylan whether or not the Perrigo Transaction is completed. Most of these expenses will be comprised of transaction costs related to the Perrigo Transaction, and the bridge loan credit facility. Mylan will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans. These fees and costs may be higher or lower than estimated. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses. Although Mylan expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow Mylan to offset incremental transaction-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.MYLAN WILL INCUR A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS TO ACQUIRE THE PERRIGO ORDINARY SHARES PURSUANT TO THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION. In connection with the Perrigo Transaction, Mylan has entered into a new bridge loan credit facility of approximately $12.5 billion to fund the cash portion of the consideration of the Perrigo Transaction. Mylan cannot guarantee that it will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to make all of the principal and interest payments under this indebtedness when such payments are due or that it will be able to refinance such indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. The failure to so repay or refinance such indebtedness when due could have a material adverse effect on Mylan’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.DISRUPTION IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD AFFECT MYLAN’S ABILITY TO REFINANCE THE BRIDGE LOAN CREDIT FACILITY ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. If and to the extent drawn, the bridge loan credit facility must be repaid within 364 days with respect to the $11.0 billion Tranche A Loan and within six months with respect to the approximately $1.5 billion Tranche C Loan, in each case after the loans are funded. Mylan anticipates refinancing, or obtaining alternative financing to repay, the bridge loan credit facility. Disruptions in the commercial credit markets or uncertainty in the United States, European Union or elsewhere could result in a tightening of financial markets. As a result of financial market turmoil or other economic, financial or commercial factors, Mylan may not be able to obtain alternate financing in order to repay the bridge loan credit facility or refinance the bridge loan facility on favorable terms, or at all.If Mylan is unable to successfully obtain alternative financing or refinance the bridge loan credit facility on favorable terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, pricing and other fee payments), this could result in additional costs to Mylan. If Mylan is unable to obtain alternate financing or refinance at all, the outstanding amounts under the bridge loan credit facility must be repaid within 364 days with respect to the $11.0 billion Tranche A Loan and within six months with respect to the approximately $1.5 billion Tranche C Loan, in each case after the loans are funded. The failure to so repay or refinance such 89Table of Contentsindebtedness when due could have a material adverse effect on Mylan’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or ordinary share price.MYLAN WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND PREVENT US FROM FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH INDEBTEDNESS. ANY REFINANCING OF THIS DEBT COULD BE AT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INTEREST RATES. MYLAN’S SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS COULD LEAD TO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES.Mylan’s increased indebtedness following the consummation of the Perrigo Transaction could have adverse consequences, including but not limited to:•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, challenges and opportunities, and changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements and other financing needs;•increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates in general because a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt.In addition, although the combined company is expected to maintain an investment grade credit rating, Mylan’s increased indebtedness following the consummation of the offer and compulsory acquisition could result in a downgrade in the credit rating of Mylan or any indebtedness of Mylan or its subsidiaries, which could increase the cost of further borrowings or refinancings of such indebtedness, limit access to sources of financing in the future or lead to other adverse consequences.The terms of Mylan’s indebtedness today impose, and any additional indebtedness we incur in the future may impose, significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, pay certain dividends, prepay other indebtedness, sell assets, incur certain liens, enter into agreements with our affiliates and our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, merge or consolidate. In addition, certain of our credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization facility, as well as certain agreements governing Perrigo’s indebtedness, require us to maintain specified financial ratios. A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios could result in a default under the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare our indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD LEAD TO LOSS OF CUSTOMERS, BUSINESS DISRUPTION, AND A DECLINE IN REVENUES, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROGRESS OF PIPELINE PRODUCTS, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OPERATIONS OF MYLAN. Mylan’s success after the Perrigo Acquisition will depend in part upon its ability to retain key employees of Mylan and Perrigo. Prior to and following the Perrigo Acquisition, employees of Mylan and Perrigo might experience uncertainty about their future roles with Mylan following the consummation of the Perrigo Acquisition, which might adversely affect Mylan’s ability to retain key managers and other employees of both companies. Competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical industry is very intense. Mylan may lose key personnel or may be unable to attract, retain, and motivate qualified individuals or the associated costs to Mylan may increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price of Mylan.THE EXCHANGE RATIO FOR THE SHARE PORTION OF THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION CONSIDERATION DOES NOT INCLUDE AN ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM. BECAUSE THE MARKET PRICE OF MYLAN ORDINARY 90Table of ContentsSHARES MAY FLUCTUATE, MYLAN SHAREHOLDERS CANNOT BE SURE OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE MYLAN ORDINARY SHARES THAT WILL BE ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION. Each Perrigo ordinary share that is acquired in the Perrigo Transaction will be exchanged for (i) $75.00 in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes, and (ii) 2.3 Mylan ordinary shares. The exchange ratio for the share portion of the Perrigo Transaction consideration does not include an adjustment mechanism and will not be adjusted in case of any increases or decreases in the price of Mylan ordinary shares or Perrigo ordinary shares. The market value of the Mylan ordinary shares that tendering Perrigo shareholders will receive in the Perrigo Transaction will depend on the market value of Mylan ordinary shares at the time tendered shares are exchanged and could vary significantly from the market value of Mylan ordinary shares as of the date of Mylan’s proxy statement in connection with the Perrigo Proposal.Changes in the price of Mylan ordinary shares may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in Mylan’s business, operations and prospects, regulatory considerations, market reaction to the Perrigo Transaction and related developments and as a result of the risks described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Many of these factors are beyond the control of Mylan. If the price of Mylan ordinary shares increases, Perrigo shareholders will receive greater value for their shares upon consummation of the Perrigo Transaction than the value calculated pursuant to the exchange ratio on the date the Perrigo Transaction was announced. Because the Perrigo Acquisition may not be completed until certain conditions have been satisfied or waived, a significant period of time may pass between the commencement of the Perrigo Transaction and the time that Mylan accepts Perrigo ordinary shares for exchange.Therefore, at the time Mylan shareholders approve the Perrigo Transaction, they will not know the exact market value of the Mylan ordinary shares that will be issued if the Perrigo Transaction is consummated. FAILURE TO ACQUIRE 100% OF THE PERRIGO ORDINARY SHARES MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPLETE ANY POST-CLOSING RESTRUCTURING OF PERRIGO AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THIS COULD REDUCE OR DELAY THE OPERATIONAL OR OTHER SYNERGIES TO MYLAN.The offer is conditional upon valid acceptances of our offer being received (and, where permitted, not withdrawn) of not less than 80% of all issued and unconditionally allotted Perrigo ordinary shares (calculated on fully diluted basis), but this percentage may be reduced by Mylan to any percentage above 50%. Were this percentage to be reduced, we could complete the Perrigo Acquisition but would not be able to acquire compulsorily the remaining Perrigo ordinary shares we do not own. We would then be entitled to exercise control of Perrigo and affect the composition of Perrigo’s board of directors. However, depending on the percentage of outstanding Perrigo ordinary shares acquired, it may take longer and be more difficult to complete any post-closing restructuring, and the full amount of the expected operational and other synergies identified for Mylan may not be obtained or may only be obtained over a longer period of time. In addition, if we own less than 100% of Perrigo after completion of the Perrigo Transaction, we may not be able to carry out joint cash pooling or other intra-company transactions with Perrigo and its subsidiaries on favorable terms or at all. This may adversely affect our ability to achieve the expected amount of operational and other synergies after the Perrigo Transaction is completed.ALTHOUGH MYLAN HAS COMMITTED TO MAKE ANY AND ALL DIVESTITURES AND OTHER SUBSTANTIVE ACTIONS, NECESSARY OR REQUIRED, IN ORDER TO CLEAR OR APPROVE THE PERRIGO ACQUISITION UNDER THE HSR ACT, MYLAN MUST OBTAIN REQUIRED APPROVALS AND CONSENTS TO CONSUMMATE THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION, WHICH, IF DELAYED OR NOT GRANTED, MAY JEOPARDIZE OR DELAY THE CONSUMMATION OF THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION, RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES OF MONEY AND RESOURCES, AND/OR REDUCE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFIT OF THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION.The Perrigo Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. These closing conditions include, among others, the effectiveness of the registration statement to register the issuance of the Mylan ordinary shares in the Perrigo Share Issuance and the receipt of the relevant approvals under the antitrust and competition laws of certain countries under which filings or approvals are required. Mylan has committed to make any and all divestitures and other substantive actions necessary or required in order to ensure the HSR Pre-Condition, as defined below, is satisfied. The making of the offer to acquire all of the outstanding Perrigo ordinary shares is pre-conditioned on one of the following having occurred: (i) the expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods (including any extensions thereof) under the HSR Act, (ii) a final decision to clear or approve the consummation of the Perrigo Acquisition under the HSR Act having been obtained, irrespective of the conditions attaching thereto, or (iii) September 13, 2015 (the “HSR Pre-Condition”). The governmental agencies from which Mylan will seek certain of these approvals have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. As a condition to their approval of the Perrigo Transaction, agencies may impose requirements, limitations, or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of Mylan’s businesses after closing. These requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures, or restrictions could delay the consummation of the Perrigo Transaction or may 91Table of Contentsreduce the anticipated benefits of the Perrigo Transaction. Further, no assurance can be given that the required closing conditions will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the closing conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions, and timing of the consents and approvals. Pursuant to the legally binding process under the Irish Takeover Rules to commence its offer for Perrigo in order to effect the Perrigo Acquisition, Mylan is generally required to commit to take, and take, any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate impediments or objections, if any, that may be asserted by governmental agencies from which Mylan seeks consents or approvals, including any divestitures needed to obtain any antitrust or competition approvals. If Mylan agrees to any material requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures, or restrictions in order to obtain any approvals required to consummate the Perrigo Acquisition these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could adversely affect Mylan’s ability to integrate Mylan’s operations with Perrigo or reduce the anticipated benefits of the Perrigo Acquisition. This could delay the consummation of the Perrigo Acquisition or have a material adverse effect on Mylan’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price. MYLAN HAS NOT HAD ACCESS TO PERRIGO’S NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION. THEREFORE, MYLAN MAY BE SUBJECT TO UNKNOWN LIABILITIES OF PERRIGO.To date, Mylan has conducted a due diligence review based only on Perrigo’s publicly available information. The consummation of the Perrigo Transaction may constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, or result in the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation (including, without limitation, any payment obligation) under Perrigo’s agreements that are not publicly available. As a result, after the consummation of the Perrigo Transaction, Mylan may be subject to unknown liabilities, or other unknown risks relating to the business and operations, of Perrigo, which may have a material adverse effect on Mylan’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.THE MARKET PRICE OF MYLAN ORDINARY SHARES AFTER THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION MAY BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE CURRENTLY AFFECTING MYLAN AND PERRIGO ORDINARY SHARES.The businesses of Mylan and Perrigo differ in many respects, including relative focus on specialty brands, generics, OTC and nutritional products and, accordingly, the results of operations of Mylan and the market price of Mylan ordinary shares after the Perrigo Transaction may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of Mylan and Perrigo. THE MARKET FOR MYLAN ORDINARY SHARES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES PURSUANT TO THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION.In connection with the completion of the Perrigo Transaction, Mylan expects to issue up to 339,346,561 Mylan ordinary shares and could issue more ordinary shares depending on Perrigo’s share capital at the completion of the Perrigo Transaction. The issuance of these new Mylan ordinary shares could have the effect of depressing the market price for our ordinary shares.CURRENT MYLAN SHAREHOLDERS WILL HAVE A REDUCED OWNERSHIP AND VOTING INTEREST AFTER THE CONSUMMATION OF THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION AND WILL EXERCISE LESS INFLUENCE OVER THE MANAGEMENT AND POLICIES OF MYLAN AS A RESULT OF THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION.Following the consummation of the Perrigo Transaction, holders of Mylan ordinary shares will own the same number of shares of Mylan that they owned in Mylan immediately before consummation of the Perrigo Transaction. Each ordinary share of Mylan, however, will represent a smaller ownership percentage of a larger company. Based on certain assumptions regarding the number of Perrigo ordinary shares to be acquired and the number of Mylan ordinary shares that will be outstanding, Mylan estimates that, if all Perrigo ordinary shares are acquired pursuant to the Perrigo Transaction, holders of Mylan ordinary shares will own approximately 61% of the outstanding Mylan ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis and former Perrigo shareholders will own approximately 39% of the outstanding Mylan ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis. As a result, current Mylan shareholders will have less influence over the management and policies of Mylan than they do now.THE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS OF MYLAN AND PERRIGO, INCLUDING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION DUE TO UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERRIGO TRANSACTION.Parties with which Mylan and Perrigo currently do business or may do business in the future, including customers and suppliers, may experience uncertainty associated with the Perrigo Transaction (regardless of whether it is in fact consummated), including with respect to current or future business relationships with Mylan, Perrigo or the combined company. As a result, the business relationships of Mylan and Perrigo may be subject to disruptions if customers, suppliers, or others attempt to negotiate 92Table of Contentschanges in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than Mylan or Perrigo. For example, certain customers and collaborators may have contractual consent rights or termination rights that may be triggered by a change of control or assignment of the rights and obligations of contracts that will be transferred in the Perrigo Transaction. In addition, the contract manufacturing business of the combined business could be impaired if existing or potential customers of Mylan or Perrigo determine not to continue or initiate contract manufacturing relationships with the combined business. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price of Mylan or the combined business or a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows of Perrigo. The effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the consummation of the Perrigo Transaction. IF COUNTERPARTIES TO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS WITH PERRIGO, INCLUDING CERTAIN DEBT AGREEMENTS, DO NOT CONSENT, CHANGE OF CONTROL RIGHTS UNDER THOSE AGREEMENTS MAY BE TRIGGERED AS A RESULT OF THE PERRIGO ACQUISITION, WHICH COULD CAUSE MYLAN TO LOSE THE BENEFIT OF SUCH AGREEMENTS AND INCUR MATERIAL LIABILITIES OR REPLACEMENT COSTS. Perrigo may be party to agreements that contain change-of-control, or certain other provisions that will be triggered as a result of the Perrigo Acquisition. If the counterparties to these agreements do not consent to the acquisition of Perrigo, the counterparties may have the ability to exercise certain rights (including termination rights), resulting in Perrigo incurring liabilities as a consequence of breaching such agreements, or causing the combined business to lose the benefit of such agreements or incur costs in seeking replacement agreements. Perrigo may have certain debt obligations that contain change-of-control, or certain other provisions, that will be triggered as a result of the Perrigo Acquisition. If these provisions are triggered, the debt obligations may have to be repurchased, refinanced or otherwise settled. We cannot assure you that sufficient funds will be available to repurchase any outstanding debt obligations or that we will be able to refinance or otherwise settle such debt obligations on favorable terms, if at all. Mylan has not had the opportunity to conduct comprehensive due diligence on Perrigo and to evaluate fully the extent to which these risk factors will affect the combined company. To date, Mylan has conducted a due diligence review based only on Perrigo’s publicly available information. As a result, after the consummation of the Perrigo Transaction, Mylan may be subject to unknown liabilities, or other unknown risks related to the business and operations, of Perrigo, which may have a material adverse effect on Mylan’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.THE PERRIGO ACQUISITION, IF SUCCESSFUL, WILL TRIGGER CERTAIN PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN PERRIGO’S EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS OR AGREEMENTS THAT WILL REQUIRE MYLAN TO MAKE CHANGE IN CONTROL PAYMENTS. Certain of Perrigo’s employee benefit plans or agreements contain change in control clauses providing for compensation to be paid to, or received by, certain Perrigo employees either upon a change in control, or if, following a change in control, Perrigo terminates the employment relationship with these employees under certain circumstances or these employees terminate the employment relationship because of certain adverse changes. If successful, the Perrigo Acquisition would constitute a change in control of Perrigo, thereby giving rise to change in control payments.ITEM 6. EXHIBITS
