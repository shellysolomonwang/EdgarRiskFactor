Item 1A. Risk Factors    The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Nasdaq. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or operating results could be adversely affected.    If we do not integrate INET’s operations successfully, we may not realize the benefits we expect to derive from the acquisition.    We paid $934.5 million in cash to acquire the INET ECN, subject to post-closing adjustments and have incurred significant costs in connection with the acquisition. As of December 31, 2005, these costs were $34.4 million. We are in the process of integrating INET’s business with ours, and we anticipate incurring between $60.0 million and $70.0 million of pre-tax charges in 2006, principally related to the INET acquisition as well and also related to our continuing efforts to reduce operating expenses and improve the efficiency of our operations. The integration involves consolidating products, highly-complex technology, operations and administrative functions of two companies that previously operated separately. If we are unable to do this successfully, then we may not achieve the projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings of the transaction. Key risks related to the integration include:        •   Timing. The integration could take longer than planned and be subject to unanticipated difficulties and expenses. Any expenses could, particularly in the near term, offset or exceed the anticipated cost savings we expect to derive from the INET acquisition.        •   Technology. We are planning to migrate our existing trading systems to INET’s platform. We may face unforeseen difficulties in achieving the migration, which could impose additional obstacles to completing the migration and could result in adverse consequences to our operations or could lead to us not achieving the synergies we anticipate.        •   Management diversion. The demand placed on the time of our management team in managing the INET integration may adversely affect the operation of our existing businesses.        •   Loss of business relationships. We may not be able to retain business relationships with suppliers and customers of INET. In particular, when we combine the books of The Nasdaq Market Center, Brut and INET, we may lose some of the business that we enjoyed when we operated the books separately.        •   Personnel losses. We may lose key INET personnel, including technology personnel.        •   Cultural changes. Employees in the acquired organization may be resistant to change and may not adapt well to our corporate culture.    22    Table of Contents Our high leverage limits our financial flexibility.    We incurred $750.0 million of senior term loan debt, entered into a $75.0 million revolving credit facility, although we had not drawn down any proceeds under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2005, and issued $205.0 million of convertible notes to pay for our recent acquisition of INET, bringing our total debt as of December 31, 2005 to $1.192 billion. This significant leverage may:        •   impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for refinancing indebtedness, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, or other purposes;        •   reduce funds available to us for our operations and general corporate purposes or for capital expenditures as a result of the dedication of a substantial portion of our consolidated cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;        •   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors with less debt;        •   increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions; and        •   curtail our flexibility to respond to changing economic or competitive conditions or to make acquisitions.    In addition, our credit facility covenants restrict our ability to grant liens, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, sell assets, make certain payments, conduct transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate, and our convertible notes contain a covenant restricting our ability to incur senior debt.    We may not be able keep up with rapid technological and other competitive changes affecting our industry.    The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent enhancements to existing services and products, the introduction of new services and products and changing customer demands. If the INET platform fails to work as expected, our business would be negatively affected. In addition, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully develop, introduce, or market new services and products or if we need to adopt costly and customized technology for our services and products. In addition, our failure to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences, or any significant delays in product development efforts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    We must adapt to significant competition in our listing business.    We face significant competition in our listing business from other exchanges. Historically, the NYSE has been our largest competitor, and we have competed with them primarily for listings of larger domestic and international companies. However, with the NYSE’s acquisition of Archipelago, the competitive landscape is changing, and the merged exchange may seek listings of small to mid-size companies, in direct competition with our listing business. The NYSE recently decreased its maximum annual listing fee by 50% from $1 million to $500,000, which is still significantly higher than, although more competitive with, our maximum annual fee of $75,000. Also, it is likely that after the merger, Archipelago will use the NYSE brand to offer low-cost listings. If we are required to lower our listing fees in response, it could have an adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, on occasion, issuers may transfer their listings from Nasdaq to other venues. Significant transfers could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.    Declines in the IPO market have an adverse effect on our revenues.    Stagnation or decline in the IPO market impacts the number of our new listings on The Nasdaq Stock Market, and thus our related revenues. We recognize revenue from new listings on a straight-line basis over an estimated six-year service period. As a result of the decline in the IPO market from 2000-2002, our deferred revenues associated with those years will be lower than our recent deferred revenue associated with the years immediately preceding that period. Our new IPO listings decreased from 148 in 2004 to 126 in 2005.    23    Table of Contents The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, commonly known as SOX, may dampen IPO activity. SOX requires Nasdaq and other U.S. markets and exchanges to impose corporate governance requirements on all listed companies. Additionally, Section 404 of SOX requires all of our listed companies to complete an internal control audit, which many companies find to be burdensome and costly. SOX has particularly received a significant amount of focus among international companies. International exchanges, such as the London Stock Exchange, and Deutsche Börse are not required to impose these requirements on their listed companies and, as a result, are becoming more significant competitors, particularly for international issuers. The LSE’s “AIM” market, which has minimal listing standards, has recently received significant attention as an alternative listing venue. We may have trouble attracting and maintaining listings of foreign based companies in light of this competition.    Losses in listings to a combined NYSE and Archipelago could cause a reduction in revenues in both our Issuer Services and Market Services segments.    While the reduction in initial listings or the loss of one or more large issuers could decrease listing revenues for our Issuer Services segment, it could cause an even more significant decrease in revenues from our Market Services segment, to the extent that we derive revenues from the quoting, reporting and trading of those issuers’ securities. If the combined NYSE/Archipelago is successful in competing with us for our core listings, we would lose not only the listing fees associated with those companies, but also a substantial amount of the trade execution fees generated by trading in those companies’ securities.    Delistings may have an adverse effect on our revenues.    Delistings generally increase under poor economic conditions, since issuers are not able to comply with our minimum bid price, market capitalization and/or shareholders’ equity requirements. Companies are also delisted when they cannot file their periodic reports with the SEC on time. During 2005, 85 companies were delisted for non-compliance with one or more of these requirements and 247 companies voluntarily delisted primarily due to mergers, going private transactions, or changing listing venues. In addition, the SEC has recently proposed new rules which will make it easier for foreign private issuers to delist and stop being U.S. reporting companies. Significant delistings would have a material adverse effect on our financial results.    A decrease in trading volume will decrease our trading revenues.    Trading volume is directly affected by economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, changes in price levels of securities and the overall level of investor confidence. Weak economic conditions or a reduction in securities prices could result in a decline in trading volume. A decline in trading volume would lower revenues from our Market Services segment and may adversely affect our operating results. We are particularly affected by declines in trading volume in technology-related securities because a significant portion of our customers’ trade in these types of securities and approximately 24% of the companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market are in the technology sector. In addition, investor confidence and trader interest, and thus trading volume, can be affected by factors outside our control, such as the publicity surrounding investigations and prosecutions for corporate governance or accounting irregularities at public companies.    We may experience fluctuations in our operating results.    The financial services industry is risky and unpredictable and is directly affected by many national and international factors beyond our control. Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results by causing a substantial decline in the financial services markets and reduced trading volume.    Our revenue, margins and operating results have varied in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future, making them difficult to predict. These difficulties are particularly exacerbated in light of our acquisition of INET and the uncertainties surrounding the benefits and costs associated with integration. Additionally, since our senior term loan debt bears interest at a variable rate and we do not have interest rate     24    Table of Contents  hedges in place on this debt, any increase in interest rates will increase our interest expense and reduce our cash flow. Other than our variable rate debt, we believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnifies the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results. As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a relatively larger impact on operating results. A substantial portion of our operating expenses is related to personnel costs, regulation and corporate overhead, none of which can be adjusted quickly. Our operating expense levels are based on our expectations for future revenue. If actual revenue is below management’s expectations, or if our expenses increase before revenues do, both gross margins and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. Because of these fluctuations, it is possible that our operating results or other operating metrics may fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors. If this happens, the market price of our common stock is likely to decline.    We must control our costs to remain profitable.    We base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services. A decline in this demand for our products and services may reduce our revenues without a corresponding decline in our expenses since we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis. Our ability to manage our costs will be particularly challenging as a result of INET acquisition and integration efforts. Failure to achieve our goals on cost savings will have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We may fail in our initiatives to increase our business. We also may not have adequately positioned ourselves in the increasingly competitive securities markets or a weakened equities market.    The separation of Instinet’s institutional brokerage business from Instinet and the related sale to an affiliate of Silver Lake Partners could result in unexpected costs.    In connection with our acquisition of Instinet, we concurrently sold Instinet’s institutional brokerage business and specified Instinet corporate-level assets to Instinet Holdings Incorporated, or Instinet Holdings, an affiliate of SLP. Instinet Holdings agreed to assume the liabilities of the institutional brokerage business, as well as the additional corporate-level liabilities not directly related to the institutional brokerage business, such as tax, severance, real estate leases and historical restructuring obligations. We may be subject to claims related to these assets. In addition, we may be subject to claims arising from Instinet’s institutional brokerage business. Under the terms of the institutional brokerage transaction agreement, Instinet Holdings agreed to indemnify us after the closing for liabilities primarily related to the businesses, assets and liabilities that it purchased, and, similarly, we have agreed to indemnify Instinet Holdings after the closing for liabilities primarily related to INET. Our ability to seek indemnification from Instinet Holdings is, however, limited by the strength of Instinet Holdings’s own financial condition, which could change in the future. Instinet Holdings may not have the ability to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us in connection with the institutional brokerage acquisition, in which case, we may be liable for these claims. These liabilities could be significant, and if we are unable to enforce the institutional brokerage indemnification obligation, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.    We face significant competition in our securities trading business, which could reduce our transactions, trade reporting and market information revenues and negatively impact our financial results.    We compete for trading of Nasdaq-, NYSE- and Amex-listed securities. Any decision by market participants to quote, execute or report trades through exchanges, ECNs or the Alternative Display Facility maintained by NASD, could have a negative impact on our share of quotes and trades in securities traded through The Nasdaq Market Center.    While we trade a fairly large percentage of securities of Nasdaq-listed companies, we face strong competition from exchanges and emerging players in the market. For non-Nasdaq-listed securities, the national exchanges offer greater liquidity in more non-Nasdaq-listed securities than we do. Accordingly, we face major obstacles in trying to attract trading volume in non-Nasdaq-listed securities.    25    Table of Contents Our responses to competition may not be sufficient to regain lost business or prevent other market participants from shifting some of their quoting and/or trade reporting to other industry participants. We may need to reduce prices to remain competitive. Our inability to compete for transactions, trade reporting and market information revenues could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    The merger of NYSE and Archipelago will create a strong competitor.    The recent merger of NYSE and Archipelago will create strong competition for us, particularly if NYSE is able to create its own electronic trading platform or migrate its trading business to Archipelago’s platform. NYSE has stated that it intends to develop electronic trading capabilities that will compete directly with Nasdaq’s. In addition, the merger with Archipelago has given NYSE access to ArcaEx’s electronic systems. If NYSE’s trading volume increases to our detriment as a result of the merger with Archipelago, it would have a negative impact on our operating results.    New competitors could reduce our revenues and impact our ability to increase our market share of transactions in Nasdaq-listed and exchange-listed securities.    It is possible that the Nasdaq/INET acquisition and the NYSE/Archipelago merger will create demand for new or expanded trading venues. For example, Knight Capital Group, Inc., a market maker in Nasdaq-listed securities, recently announced the acquisition of Attain ECN, a competitor of ours. TradeBot Systems recently announced the establishment of BATS ECN, which it indicated would be operational early in 2006. Citigroup Inc. recently announced plans to launch its own electronic stock-trading network from its acquisition of OnTrade Inc., an ECN previously operated by NexTrade Holdings Inc. We believe Regulation NMS may enhance competition in Nasdaq-listed securities from these or other new competitors. Additionally, new ECNs may develop trading platforms that are more competitive than ours. Finally, there has been increased use of electronic trading systems specializing in large volume trades, such as LiquidNet, Pipeline Trading and Investment Technology Group’s POSIT platform, which may divert trading volume from The Nasdaq Market Center. If these or other trading venues are successful, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.    Price competition has affected and could continue to affect our business.    The securities trading industry is characterized by intense price competition. We have in the past lowered prices and increased rebates to attempt to gain market share. These strategies have not always been successful and have at times hurt our operating performance. Additionally, we have also been, and may once again be, required to adjust pricing to respond to actions by our competitors, which have adversely impacted our operating results.    Price competition with respect to market data rebates or our program relating to sharing revenues associated with trading Nasdaq-listed securities could attract trading volume away from us, leading to loss of market share and decreased revenues.    System limitations, failures or security breaches could harm our business.    Our business depends on the integrity and performance of the computer and communications systems supporting it. If our systems cannot expand to cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and services. These consequences could result in lower trading volumes, financial losses, decreased customer service and satisfaction and regulatory sanctions. We have experienced occasional systems failures and delays in the past and could experience future systems failures and delays, especially as we implement new systems associated with the INET migration.    26    Table of Contents We use internally developed systems to operate our business, including transaction processing systems to accommodate increased capacity. If our trading volume increases unexpectedly, we will need to expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure. We do not know whether we will be able to accurately project the rate, timing, or cost of any increases, or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate any increases in a timely manner.    Our systems and operations also are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, natural disasters, power loss, sabotage or terrorism, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. We have active and aggressive programs in place to identify and minimize our exposure to these vulnerabilities and work in collaboration with the technology industry to share corrective measures with our business partners. Although we currently maintain multiple computer facilities that are designed to provide redundancy and back-up to reduce the risk of system disruptions and have facilities in place that are expected to maintain service during a system disruption, such systems and facilities may prove inadequate. Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service could impair our reputation, damage our brand name and negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.    The adoption and implementation of Regulation NMS by the SEC could adversely affect our business.    On April 6, 2005, the SEC adopted Regulation NMS, which has four primary components: the Order Protection Rule, the Access Rule, the Market Data Rule and the Sub-Penny Rule. We may incur technological and other costs in changing our systems and operations so that we can comply with these rules. Additionally, the impact of Regulation NMS is hard to predict and there may be problems or competitive challenges that we do not foresee that adversely affect our business as Regulation NMS is implemented. Finally, there is also a risk that the rules may materially change during implementation which would undermine business plans and investments that have been made based on the current form of the rules.    Our revenues may be affected by competition in the business for financial products.    We have grown our financial products business, which creates indexes and licenses them for Nasdaq-branded financial products. Nasdaq-sponsored financial products are subject to intense competition from other ETFs, derivatives and structured products as investment alternatives. Our revenues may be adversely affected by increasing competition from competitors’ financial products designed to replicate or correlate with the performance of Nasdaq financial products. In addition, the legal and regulatory climate, which supports the licensing of these financial products, may change in a manner which adversely impacts our ability to successfully license our products. Further, many other entrants have recently emerged who not only compete with us for future growth opportunities, but who may also introduce products that erode the position of our current offerings, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial conditions and operating results.    We must continue to invest in our operations to integrate INET and to maintain and grow our business, and we may need additional funds to support our business.    In addition to our debt service obligations, we will need to make substantial investments in our operations on a continuing basis during 2006 to integrate the INET acquisition. If our current level of operating results decrease, our need to spend cash to service debt payments may impair our ability to make investments in our business or to integrate INET.    We depend on the availability of adequate capital to maintain and develop our business. We believe that our current capital requirements will be met from internally generated funds and cash on hand. However, based upon a variety of factors, some of which are not within our control, our ability to fund our capital requirements may vary from those currently planned.    Should we raise funds through incurring additional debt, we may become subject to covenants even more restrictive than those contained in our current debt instruments. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity our equity holders may suffer dilution. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on a timely basis, or on favorable terms or at all.    27    Table of Contents Future acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures may require significant resources and/or result in significant unanticipated losses, costs, or liabilities.    In the future we may seek to grow our company by making additional acquisitions or entering into partnerships and joint ventures, which may be material. As contemplated by this strategy, we have submitted a non-binding indication of interest to acquire the LSE, although the LSE announced that it intended to continue with its previously announced share capital return plan and did not intend to pursue Nasdaq’s proposal. In response, we announced our belief that the proposed transaction would represent an attractive offer for shareholders, listed companies and the trading community and would reflect unique benefits for LSE which have not to date been proffered by other parties. In light of the substantial amount of consideration reflected in our non-binding proposal, completion of the acquisition of the LSE would require significant financing.    We may finance future acquisitions by issuing additional equity and/or debt. The issuance of additional equity in connection with any such transaction could be substantially dilutive to existing stockholders. The issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially. In addition, announcement or implementation of future transactions by us or others could have a material effect on the price of our stock. We could face financial risks associated with incurring additional debt, particularly if the debt resulted in significant incremental leverage. Additional debt may reduce our liquidity, curtail our access to financing markets and increase the cash flow required for debt service. Any incremental debt incurred to finance an acquisition could also place significant constraints on the operation of our business. Additionally, acquisitions, partnerships or investments may require significant managerial attention, which may be diverted from our other operations.    These equity, debt and managerial commitments may impair the operation of our businesses. Furthermore, any future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail a number of additional risks, including:        •   problems with effective integration of operations;        •   the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;        •   increased operating costs;        •   problems with regulatory bodies;        •   exposure to unanticipated liabilities;        •   difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; and        •   changes in our credit rating and financing costs.    Regulatory changes and changes in market structure could have a material adverse effect on our business.    We operate in a highly regulated industry. In recent years, the securities trading industry and, in particular, the securities markets, have been subject to significant regulatory changes. Moreover, the securities markets have been the subject of increasing governmental and public scrutiny in response to a number of recent developments and inquiries. Any of these factors or events may result in future regulatory or other changes, although we cannot predict the nature of these changes or their impact on our business at this time. Our customers also operate in a highly regulated industry. The SEC and other regulatory authorities could impose regulatory changes that could impact the ability of our customers to use The Nasdaq Market Center or could adversely affect The Nasdaq Stock Market. The loss of a significant number of customers or a reduction in trading activity on The Nasdaq Stock Market as a result of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    We are subject to extensive regulation that may harm our ability to compete with less regulated entities.    Under current federal securities laws, changes in our rules and operations, including our pricing structure, must be reviewed, and in many cases explicitly approved by the SEC. The SEC may approve, disapprove, or recommend changes to proposals that we submit. In addition, the SEC may delay the initiation of the public     28    Table of Contents  comment process or the approval process. This delay in approving changes, or the altering of any proposed change, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We must compete not only with ECNs that are not subject to the same SEC approval process, but also with other exchanges that have lower regulation and surveillance costs than us. There is a risk that trading will shift to exchanges that charge lower fees because, among other reasons, they spend significantly less on regulation services.    In addition, Brut and some subsidiaries of INET are broker-dealers. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that did not apply to us before the Brut acquisition. Any failure to comply with these broker-dealer regulations could have a material effect on the operation of our business, financial condition and operating results. Brut is currently the subject of an investigation by the NASD. An adverse outcome may result in the imposition of fines or other sanctions on Brut.    We have self-regulatory organization obligations and also operate a for-profit business, and these two roles may create conflicts of interest.    We have obligations to regulate and monitor activities on The Nasdaq Stock Market and ensure compliance with applicable law and the rules of our market by market participants and Nasdaq-listed companies. The SEC staff has expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest of “for-profit” markets performing the regulatory functions of a self-regulatory organization. While we outsource the majority of our market regulation functions to NASD, we do perform regulatory functions related to our listed companies and our market. In addition, as part of our application for exchange registration, we have agreed that 20% of the directors of our exchange subsidiary will be elected by members of our exchange rather than the equity holders of our subsidiary. Any failure by us to diligently and fairly regulate our market or to otherwise fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation, prompt SEC scrutiny and adversely affect our business and reputation.    Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our brand-building efforts and ability to compete effectively.    To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, clients, strategic partners and others. The protective steps that we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. We may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. We have registered, or applied to register, our trademarks in the United States and in over 40 foreign jurisdictions and have pending U.S. and foreign applications for other trademarks. Effective trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our services. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our brand and affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, defending our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.    Failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.    Our future success depends, in large part, upon our key employees who execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives. In particular, we are highly dependent on the continued services of Robert Greifeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and other executive officers and key employees who possess extensive financial markets knowledge and technology skills. We do not have employment agreements with some of our executive officers, which would prevent them from leaving and competing with us. We do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our executive officers, managers, key employees or technical personnel. The loss of the services of these persons for any reason, as well as any negative market or industry perception arising from that loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may incur costs to replace key employees that leave, and our ability to execute our business model could be impaired if we cannot replace departing employees in a timely manner.    29    Table of Contents We are subject to risks relating to litigation and potential securities laws liability.    Many aspects of our business potentially involve substantial liability risks. While we enjoy immunity from private suits for self-regulatory organization activities, we and our broker-dealer affiliates could be exposed to liability under federal and state securities laws, other federal and state laws and court decisions, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and other regulatory agencies. These risks include, among others, potential liability from disputes over the terms of a trade, or claims that a system failure or delay cost a customer money, that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a securities transaction. As we intend to defend any such litigation actively, significant legal expenses could be incurred. An adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us or our affiliates could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    In addition, we are subject to oversight by the SEC. The SEC regularly examines us and our broker-dealer affiliates for compliance with our obligations under the securities laws. In the case of non-compliance with our obligations under those laws, we or our broker-dealer affiliates could be subject to investigation and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties.    We are in the process of becoming a holding company that will depend on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.    At our 2005 annual meeting of stockholders, our voting securityholders approved our reorganization into a new holding company structure through the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets and liabilities to one or more of our subsidiaries. This restructuring facilitated SEC approval of our registration as a national securities exchange. Once we affect this restructuring, we will be a holding company with no material assets other than the equity interests of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, all our operations will be conducted by our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we will require dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to meet cash requirements or to pay dividends. If our subsidiaries are unable to pay us dividends and make other payments to us when needed, we will be unable to pay dividends or satisfy our obligations.    NASD will continue to maintain voting control over us until we meet SEC conditions to operate as an exchange and may have interests that are different from yours and, therefore, may make decisions that are adverse to your interests.    The SEC requires that NASD retain greater than 50% of the voting control over us until we operate as an exchange and no longer rely on NASD’s SRO license to operate The Nasdaq Stock Market. NASD maintains voting control through the single outstanding share of our series D preferred stock. Therefore, NASD will continue to retain voting control over us until we meet SEC conditions to operate as an exchange. As a result, until such time, NASD will continue to have the ability, if it so elects, to dictate the outcome of matters brought to a vote of our stockholders. NASD may have interests that conflict with the interests of holders of our common stock. NASD’s voting control may delay or prevent a change in control, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us or result in actions that may be opposed by other stockholders.    The SEC’s approval of our application to operate a national securities exchange contains conditions that must be satisfied before we implement the order.    On January 13, 2006, the SEC approved our application to register a newly formed limited liability company, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, as an exchange. The SEC’s approval order contains several conditions that must be satisfied before we can operate as an exchange, some of which are subject to SEC approval or the actions of third parties. The primary condition imposed by the SEC requires us to become a participant in national market system plans. We will need to pay amounts, which have not yet been determined, but which may be significant, in order to join these plans. Additionally, we may need to adjust our business practices to join these plans in a manner that will impose costs on us.    30    Table of Contents Other conditions require NASD to offer a facility for disseminating over-the-counter quotations and collecting over-the-counter trade reports, for non-Nasdaq-listed securities. Satisfaction of this condition is dependent on, among other things, NASD’s ability to obtain the approval of the participants in certain of the national market system plans for this facility. We continue to rely on NASD’s SRO license to operate The Nasdaq Stock Market and all actions taken by us pursuant to authority delegated by NASD are subject to review, ratification or rejection by NASD’s Board of Governors.    Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our stockholders.    The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile. Broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuations in our stock price may include, among other things:        •   actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;        •   changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;        •   conditions or trends in our industry, including trading volumes, regulatory changes or changes in the securities marketplace, including with respect to the NYSE/Archipelago merger;        •   announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;        •   announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;        •   additions or departures of key personnel; and        •   sales of our common stock, including sales of our common stock by our directors and officers or our strategic investors.    The market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets.    Sales by our stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using our equity securities. As of March 8, 2006, there were 92,490,271 shares of our common stock outstanding. All of our outstanding shares are freely transferable, except shares held by our “affiliates,” as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, and 14,201,625 shares of common stock acquired or able to be acquired from NASD upon exercise of warrants issued by NASD, or the Warrant Shares. The Warrant Share are held by current and former NASD members. The Warrant Shares are not currently registered under the Securities Act and are transferable only to the extent permitted by securities laws, such as Rule 144. We plan to provide for the sale of the remaining Warrant Shares by filing a prospectus supplement with the SEC no later than May 2006. Upon the filing of the prospectus supplement, holders of these Warrant Shares will be able to freely transfer these shares. If any of the warrants expire without being exercised, then we expect NASD would be able to sell the underlying shares under the prospectus supplement.    The number of freely transferable shares of our common stock will increase upon any exercise of outstanding options pursuant to our stock compensation and stock award plan for our employees. There were 5,316,755 options exercisable as of December 31, 2005 at a weighted average exercise price of $10.30. The number of shares of our common stock outstanding will also increase upon any conversion of our convertible notes held by SLP and Hellman & Friedman or their respective affiliates, which are convertible at a conversion price of $14.50 per share into approximately 30.7 million shares of our common stock, or any exercise of our warrants held by SLP and Hellman & Friedman or their respective affiliates, which are exercisable at a price of $14.50 per share into approximately 5.0 million shares of our common stock. The notes and the shares underlying the notes and the warrants are not transferable without our consent until September 8, 2006. In addition, the notes and the shares underlying the notes and the warrants may only be sold pursuant to a     31    Table of Contents  registration statement, prospectus supplement or an exemption from registration. We have granted SLP and Hellman & Friedman and their affiliates demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to the convertible notes and the shares of our common stock underlying those notes and warrants. These shares become entitled to the benefits of such registration rights as early as September 2006. Upon the effectiveness of such a registration, all shares or notes covered by a registration statement will be freely transferable.    Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and approved exchange rules, including provisions included to address SEC concerns, and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company and entrench current management.    Our organizational documents place restrictions on the voting rights of certain stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation limits the voting rights of persons (either alone or with related parties) owning more than 5% of the then outstanding votes entitled to be cast on any matter, other than NASD or any other person as may be approved by our board of directors prior to the time such person owns more than 5% of the then outstanding votes entitled to be cast on any matter. The SEC has proposed rules that will impose voting and ownership limitations on broker-dealers of 20%, but not require other voting or ownership limitations. We have not determined at this time if we will seek to raise our 5% voting limitation if the SEC adopts the proposed rule. Any change to the 5% voting limitation would require SEC approval.    In response to the SEC’s concern about a concentration of our ownership, our approved exchange rules include a rule prohibiting any Nasdaq member or any person associated with a Nasdaq member beneficially owning more than 20% of our outstanding voting interests. SEC consent would be required before any investor could obtain more than a 20% voting interest in us. Exchange rules will also require the SEC’s approval of any business ventures with one of our members, subject to exceptions.    In addition, our organizational documents contain provisions that may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us, such as a tender offer or takeover proposal that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock. Additionally, certain of these provisions make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in entrenchment of current management.    In addition, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws:        •   require supermajority stockholder approval to remove directors;        •   do not permit stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;        •   require certain advance notice for director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;        •   require supermajority stockholder approval with respect to certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and constitution (including in respect of the provisions set forth above); and        •   authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, or “blank check” preferred stock, that could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval.    Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more (or, in some cases, a holder who previously held 15% or more) of our common stock. In general, Delaware law prohibits a publicly held corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for three years after the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless the corporation’s board of directors and stockholders approve the business combination in a prescribed manner.    32    Table of Contents  Item 1B.
