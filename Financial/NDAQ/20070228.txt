Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.    3    Table of Contents Forward-Looking Statements    The SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains these types of statements. Words such as “anticipates,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes” and words or terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These include, among others, statements relating to:        •    2007 outlook;        •    the scope, nature or impact of acquisitions, dispositions, investments or other transactional activities;        •    the effective dates for and expected benefits of ongoing initiatives; and        •    the outcome of any litigation and/or government investigation to which we are a party and other contingencies.    Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:        •    our operating results may be lower than expected;        •    loss of significant trading volume or listed companies;        •    our ability to implement our strategic initiatives and any consequences from our pursuit of our corporate strategy;        •    competition, economic, political and market conditions and fluctuations, including interest rate risk;        •    government and industry regulation; or        •    adverse changes that may occur in the securities markets generally.

Part I     Item 1. Business.    Nasdaq Overview    The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. is a holding company that operates The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC as its wholly-owned subsidiary. Nasdaq became a holding company on August 1, 2006 when The Nasdaq Stock Market commenced operations as a registered national securities exchange for Nasdaq-listed securities.    We, through our subsidiaries, are a leading provider of securities listing, trading, and information products and services. Our revenue sources are diverse and include revenues from transaction services, market data     4    Table of Contents  products and services, listing fees, insurance products, shareholder and newswire services and financial products. The Nasdaq Stock Market is the largest electronic equity securities market in the United States, both in terms of number of listed companies and traded share volume. As of December 31, 2006, The Nasdaq Stock Market was home to approximately 3,193 listed companies with a combined market capitalization of over $4.1 trillion. We also operate, through the exchange subsidiary, The Nasdaq Market Center, which provides our market participants with the ability to access, process, display and integrate orders and quotes in The Nasdaq Stock Market and other national securities exchanges. Transactions involving 580.9 billion equity securities were executed on or reported to our systems in 2006, 59.9% higher than the 363.3 billion in 2005.    We manage, operate and provide our products and services in two business segments, our Market Services segment and Issuer Services segment.    Market Services. Our Market Services segment includes our transaction-based business and our market information services business. The Nasdaq Market Center is our transaction-based platform that provides our market participants with the ability to access, process, display and integrate orders and quotes, enabling our customers to execute trades in over 7,700 equity securities (including Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs) during 2006. The Nasdaq Market Center allows us to route and execute buy and sell orders as well as report transactions for Nasdaq-listed securities and those securities listed on other national securities exchanges, providing fee-based revenues. We also generate revenues by providing varying levels of quote and trade information to market participants and data vendors, who in turn sell subscriptions for this information to the public. Our systems enable vendors to gain direct access to our detailed order data, index information, mutual fund pricing information, and corporate action information on Nasdaq-listed securities.    For the year ended December 31, 2006, Market Services revenues were $1,408.3 million, which represented 84.9% of Nasdaq’s total revenues. Market Services gross margin (total revenues less cost of revenues) was $437.9 million, which represented 63.7% of total gross margin. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements.    Issuer Services. Our Issuer Services segment includes our securities listings business, insurance business, shareholder and newswire services and our financial products business. The companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market represent a diverse array of industries including information technology, financial services, healthcare, consumer products and industrials. We also develop and license financial products and associated derivatives based on Nasdaq indexes. These include the QQQ, which is an ETF based on the Nasdaq-100 Index. In 2006, the QQQ was one of the most actively traded ETFs in the world and the most actively traded listed security in the United States. We have also introduced financial products based on other Nasdaq indexes, including the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index. In addition, we generate revenues by licensing and listing third-party structured products and third-party sponsored ETFs.    For the year ended December 31, 2006, Issuer Services accounted for revenues of $249.0 million, which represented 15.1% of our total revenues and 36.3% of our gross margin. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements.    LSE Investment. We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Nightingale Acquisition Limited, or NAL, hold an investment in the London Stock Exchange Group plc, or the LSE, totaling approximately 28.8% of the issued ordinary share capital of the LSE. We acquired these shares from LSE shareholders in a series of purchases beginning in April 2006.    In March 9, 2006, we submitted a non-binding indication of interest to acquire the LSE which was rejected by the board of LSE. In November 2006, we announced the terms of final offers to acquire all of the ordinary share capital of LSE not already owned by NAL at a price of 1,243 pence per share and all of the B share capital of LSE at a price of 200 pence (plus accrued dividend) per share. These final offers lapsed on February 10, 2007.    5    Table of Contents We continue to explore and evaluate strategic opportunities in the global markets to build on our existing position as the largest electronic equities exchange in the United States. We have a highly disciplined approach to acquisitions and will only consummate transactions to the extent they deliver clear and visible benefits for our shareholders, and enable us to allocate benefits to market participants. See “—Acquisition Strategy” and “Risk factors—Futures acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures may require significant resources and/or result in significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities”.    Integration of INET. We recently completed the integration of Nasdaq’s legacy execution system and the Brut and INET execution systems onto a single platform. In October 2006, we migrated all trading in Nasdaq-listed securities to the INET platform, and all non-Nasdaq-listed securities trading on the Brut platform to INET’s platform in November 2006. The final aspect of our system integration—the transfer of non-Nasdaq-listed securities from Nasdaq’s legacy execution system to the INET platform—was implemented in February 2007. We believe that our system integration provides the foundation for improved execution quality and speed, while maintaining key attributes of The Nasdaq Market Center, including market making functionality, attributed quotes, and the Opening, Closing, Halt and IPO crosses.    Exchange Registration. We began operating as a national securities exchange for Nasdaq-listed securities on August 1, 2006 and a national securities exchange for non-Nasdaq listed securities on February 12, 2007, simultaneous with the integration of our trading systems for these securities. Exchange registration gives us our own Self Regulatory Organization, or SRO, license, allows us to operate independently of National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or NASD, and provides benefits to our proprietary data business and our corporate governance structure.    To facilitate our operations as a national securities exchange, we formed The Trade Reporting Facility LLC, or the TRF, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Through the TRF we continue to collect reports of trades executed by broker-dealers outside of our exchange. NASD regulates the TRF as one of its facilities. The TRF began operating on August 1, 2006 for Nasdaq-listed securities and will begin operating in March 2007 for non-Nasdaq-listed securities.    Nasdaq History and Structure    We were founded in 1971 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of NASD, which operates subject to the oversight of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Beginning in 2000, NASD restructured and broadened our ownership through a two-phase private placement of our securities. Securities in the private placements were offered to all NASD members, as well as some investment companies and issuers listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market.    In connection with the restructuring, on November 9, 2000, we applied to the SEC for registration as a national securities exchange. The SEC approved our application on January 13, 2006, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions. Prior to the satisfaction of the conditions to exchange registration, The Nasdaq Stock Market operated under a Delegation Plan approved by the SEC that provided a delegation of legal authority from NASD to us to operate as a stock market. Although we exercised primary responsibility for market-related functions, including market-related rulemaking and interpretations, all actions taken pursuant to authority by NASD were subject to review, ratification, or rejection by the NASD board of directors.    The Exchange began operating as a registered national securities exchange for Nasdaq-listed securities in August 2006 and as an exchange for non-Nasdaq-listed securities in February 2007, simultaneous with the integration of our trading systems for these securities. The TRF also began operating in August 2006 for Nasdaq-listed securities and will begin operating in March 2007 for non-Nasdaq-listed securities.    On December 20, 2006, we ceased to be a subsidiary of NASD. NASD maintained voting control over us through its ownership of the one outstanding share of our Series D preferred stock and NASD consolidated our     6    Table of Contents  financial position and results of operations in its consolidated financial statements. In connection with the Exchange entering into a transitional regulatory services agreement with NASD and the submission to the SEC of a related filing by NASD, Nasdaq was removed as a party to the Delegation Plan and Nasdaq redeemed the share of Series D preferred stock that had been issued to NASD. The removal of Nasdaq from the Delegation Plan was the final SEC condition to the Exchange beginning to operate as an exchange for trading of non-Nasdaq-listed securities. NASD achieved full divestiture of ownership of our common stock with the sale of its remaining shares of our common stock in July 2006.    In August 2006, we adopted a holding company structure in connection with our registration as a national securities exchange that had been approved by our stockholders in 2005. Our newly formed subsidiary, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, holds the operations of the exchange and our exchange license. In November 2006, we completed an internal reorganization that resulted in the transfer of ownership of some of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, to our exchange subsidiary.    With exchange registration, Nasdaq received its own SRO status through Nasdaq’s exchange subsidiary separate from that of NASD. Pursuant to securities laws, an SRO is responsible for regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules and regulations governing the business conduct of its members. As an SRO, the Exchange has its own rules pertaining to its members and listed companies regarding listing, membership and trading that are distinct and separate from those rules applicable to broker-dealers that are administered by NASD. Broker-dealers may choose to become members of the Exchange, in addition to their memberships with other SROs, including NASD. See “—Regulation.” NASD continues to provide regulatory services to us. See “—Regulatory Contractual Relationships with NASDR.”    Products and Services    We operate in two segments: Market Services and Issuer Services. Financial information about segments and geographic areas may be found in Note 20, “Segments,” to our consolidated financial statements.    Market Services. Our Market Services segment includes our transaction-based business and our market information services business.    Trade Execution Services. The Nasdaq Market Center is our transaction-based platform that provides market participants with the ability to access, process, display and integrate orders and quotes in The Nasdaq Stock Market. Market participants include market makers, broker-dealers operating as Electronic Communication Networks, or ECNs, registered securities exchanges and other broker-dealers. We provide these services for Nasdaq-listed and non-Nasdaq-listed securities. Specifically, The Nasdaq Market Center:        •    Provides a comprehensive display of the interest by our market participants at the highest price a participant is willing to buy a security (best bid) and also the lowest price a participant is willing to sell that security (best offer).        •    Provides subscribers quotes, orders and total anonymous interest at every price level in The Nasdaq Market Center for Nasdaq-listed securities and critical data for the Opening Cross, Closing Cross, Halt Cross and IPO Cross.        •    Provides anonymity to market participants, i.e., participants do not know the identity of the firm displaying the order unless that firm chooses to reveal its identity, which can contribute to improved pricing for securities by reducing the potential market impact that transactions by investors whose trading activity, if known, may influence others.    Our execution services generate revenues from:        •    Transaction execution charges, which are charges assessed on a per share basis to the party that accesses the liquidity provided by another market participant. In most circumstances, we credit a portion of the     7    Table of Contents       per share execution charge as a rebate (presented as cost of revenues) to the market participant that provides the liquidity (liquidity is the number and range of buy and sell orders available to our market participants). These charges represent our primary fee for execution services.        •    Our share of tape fees for the trading of securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, and the American Stock Exchange, or Amex.    Also, we pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Section 31 fees. These fees are recorded as execution and trade reporting revenues with a corresponding amount recorded as cost of revenues. The Section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. We collect the fees as a pass-through charge from organizations executing eligible trades on the Exchange and recognize these amounts in cost of revenues when invoiced. Section 31 fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. Since the amount recorded in revenues is equal to the amount recorded in cost of revenues, there is no impact on our gross margin or net income.    To enhance market transparency, we introduced the Opening Cross and Closing Cross in 2004 and the Halt Cross and IPO Cross in 2006. The Opening Cross is a process for pre-market open trading and price discovery consisting of a centralized order facility that provides market participants and investors with a highly transparent and accurate opening price in Nasdaq-listed securities. Similarly, the Closing Cross is a centralized order facility that provides an orderly market close for Nasdaq-listed securities. The new IPO Cross is designed to provide executions utilizing a fair and transparent process to begin secondary trading of initial public offerings based on supply and demand. The Halt Cross is designed to provide executions utilizing a fair and transparent process when we resume trading in market halted securities. A new pegged order type that allows the price of an order to be pegged to the mid-point of the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) was introduced in January 2007.    We also have announced plans to introduce the Nasdaq Crossing Network, a new fully-anonymous trade execution facility designed to promote the execution of large trades, during the second quarter of 2007. The Nasdaq Crossing Network will provide market participants and investors with a highly efficient and accurate single price at specific times during the trading day, resulting in the discovery of larger pools of liquidity while minimizing market impact and associated price movements.    We recently completed our integration of The Nasdaq Market Center and the Brut and INET execution systems into a single platform. Nasdaq system integration, which is based on the INET platform, is intended to provide improved execution quality and speed, while maintaining the attributes of The Nasdaq Market Center, including market making functionality, attributed quotes, and the Opening, Closing, Halt and IPO Crosses. Our system integration in Nasdaq-listed securities was completed in the fourth quarter of 2006 and the system integration in non-Nasdaq-listed securities was completed in February 2007.    We currently provide connectivity and order routing to options exchanges. In 2006, we announced plans to introduce an equity and index options market in 2007, pending approval from the SEC. Our options market will be designed to leverage our existing technology, which we acquired through the INET acquisition. In addition, we plan to leverage our current customer connectivity and market structure. We intend to design Nasdaq’s options market to handle the options market transition from nickel and dime quoting increments to penny quoting increments.   Trade Reporting Services. All registered national securities exchanges and securities associations are required to establish a transaction reporting plan for the central collection of price and volume information concerning trades executed in those markets. We provide three primary revenue-generating reporting services:        •    Trade reporting—Trades executed on The Nasdaq Stock Market are automatically reported by us under the appropriate transaction reporting plan. Currently, we do not charge market participants for reporting     8    Table of Contents       most of these trades. We do, however, earn revenues for all of these trades in the form of shared market information revenues under the Nasdaq Unlisted Trading Privileges Plan, or the UTP Plan, for Nasdaq-listed securities, under the Consolidated Tape Plan, or CTA Plan, for NYSE-listed securities and the Consolidated Quotation Plan, or the CQ Plan, for Amex- and regional exchange-listed securities. In addition, the TRF collects trade reports as a facility of the NASD. A large percentage of these trades result from orders that broker-dealers have matched internally, or internalized, and are submitted to the TRF for reporting purposes only. The TRF does not charge market participants for locked in reporting of most trades, but it does earn shared market information revenues with respect to the trades.        •    Trade comparison—The TRF also generates revenues by providing trade comparison to broker dealers by matching and locking-in the two parties to a trade that they have submitted to the TRF for reporting and clearing.        •    Risk management—We provide clearing firms with risk management services to assist them in monitoring their exposure to their correspondent brokers.    Access Services to Our Trading Platform. We provide our market participants with several alternatives for accessing The Nasdaq Market Center for a fee. By shifting connectivity to The Nasdaq Market Center from proprietary networks to third-party networks, we have significantly reduced our technology and network costs and increased our systems’ scalability without affecting performance or reliability.    The Nasdaq Market Center may be accessed using our Financial Information Exchange, or FIX, product that uses the FIX protocol, a standard method of financial communication between trading firms and vendors, which enables firms to leverage their existing FIX technology with cost-effective connections to us. We also have developed QIX, a proprietary programming interface that provides a more streamlined and efficient protocol for our users with expanded functionality, including quotation updates. Market participants may also access The Nasdaq Market Center using Computer-to-Computer interface, another protocol, which allows market participants to enter transactions directly from their computer systems to our computer systems. Finally, firms may use former INET protocols to access our single trading platform. As an alternative to a firm-developed trading front-end, Nasdaq provides the New Nasdaq Workstation (NNW), an internet browser based interface that allows market participants to view market data and enter orders, quotes and trade reports.    We also provide co-location services to our market participants whereby firms may lease space for equipment within our data center. We charge these participants fees for cabinet space, connectivity and support.    Market Information. We collect and provide varying levels of quote and trade information to market participants and to data vendors, who in turn sell subscriptions for this information to the public as part of our Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions business. We collect information, distribute it and earn revenues as a member of the UTP Plan and as a distributor of our proprietary market data.    We operate as the exclusive Securities Information Processor as part of the UTP Plan for the collection and dissemination of the best bid and offer information and last transaction information from the exchanges and markets that quote and trade in Nasdaq-listed securities. We are also a participant in the UTP Plan and share in the net distribution of revenue according to the plan on the same terms as the other plan participants. In our role as the Securities Information Processor, we collect and disseminate quotation and last sale information for all transactions in Nasdaq-listed securities whether on The Nasdaq Stock Market or other exchanges. We sell this information to data vendors, which the data vendors then sell to the public. After deducting costs associated with acting as an exclusive Securities Information Processor, we distribute the tape fees to the respective UTP Plan participants, including us, based on a combination of the participants’ respective annual trade volume and share volume. In addition, all Nasdaq Market Center trades in exchange-listed securities are reported and disseminated in real time, and as such, we share in the tape fees for information on NYSE- and Amex-listed securities.    9    Table of Contents As a national securities exchange, since February 2006 we no longer have to share our revenues under the UTP Plan related to information about our individual market participants’ quotations. We are still required to share UTP Plan revenue related to trade reports and the best priced quotations in our market.    Our market participants have real-time access to quote and trade data. Interested parties that are not direct market participants in The Nasdaq Stock Market also can receive real-time quote and trade information beyond the best bid and offer quotes through a number of proprietary products that we offer. We use our broad distribution network of 1,436 market data vendors and market participants to deliver data regarding our market depth, index values, mutual fund valuation, order imbalances, market sentiment and other analytical data. We offer a range of proprietary data products, including TotalView, our flagship market depth quote product. TotalView shows subscribers quotes, orders and total anonymous interest at every price level in The Nasdaq Market Center for Nasdaq-listed securities and critical data for the Opening, Closing, Halt and IPO Crosses.    TotalView is offered through distributors to professional subscribers for a monthly fee per terminal and to non-professional subscribers for a lower monthly fee per terminal. We also offer a TotalView Enterprise License to facilitate broad based distribution of this data to large audiences. In 2006, our TotalView professional subscribers increased by over 60% (excluding non-paying internal users and users via the Nasdaq Workstation product). In addition, we charge the distributor a monthly distributor fee.    We operate several other proprietary services and data products to provide market information, which include:        •    Nasdaq Market Analytix, launched in 2006, a suite of data products including Nasdaq Market Forces and Nasdaq Velocity designed to provide market insights based on calculations performed on the data that is provided to Nasdaq’s execution services;        •    ModelView, launched in 2005, a product designed to provide greater insight into the patterns of liquidity in The Nasdaq Market Center;        •    OpenView, launched in 2005, a product providing complete depth-of-book liquidity for The Nasdaq Market Center in NYSE- and Amex-listed securities;        •    OrderView, launched in 2005, a market data feed that facilitates program and algorithmic trading;        •    the Mutual Fund Quotation Service, a listing service for over 20,000 mutual funds, money market funds and unit investment trusts that supports fund data, including net asset values, and capital gains and dividend income distribution and provides print and electronic media exposure for the funds;        •    the Mutual Fund Dissemination Service, a service that facilitates the real-time and end-of-day recap dissemination of all mutual fund pricing information and is used by data vendors and media to receive complete net asset value data on funds listed with us;        •    Nasdaq Index Dissemination service, a real-time data feed that carries the values for a number of broad-based and sector indexes and ETFs;        •    Nasdaq.com, a leading financial website for the investor community that generates revenues from advertising and product sales; and        •    NasdaqTrader.com, a financial website that provides broker-dealers and market data vendors with information and data regarding our corporate initiatives (such as Open, Closing, Halt and IPO Crosses) and other products and services for a monthly subscription fee.    Issuer Services. Our Issuer Services segment includes our securities listings business, insurance business, shareholder and newswire services and our financial products business.    Securities Listings Business. We operate our securities listings business as the Corporate Client Group, which provides customer support services and products to Nasdaq-listed companies and is responsible for obtaining new listings on The Nasdaq Stock Market. More companies list on The Nasdaq Stock Market than any other U.S. market.    10    Table of Contents The companies that list on The Nasdaq Stock Market operate in diverse industries. The following chart shows the percentage of Nasdaq-listed U.S. companies by industry as of December 31, 2006.         We aggressively pursue new listings from companies undergoing IPOs. In 2006, we attracted 67% of the IPOs eligible for The Nasdaq Stock Market or the NYSE and 39% of the capital raised from these IPOs.                        Year Ended December 31,         2006       2005       2004      Initial public offerings listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market     137       126       148     Percentage of initial public offerings on primary U.S. markets     67 %     59 %     61 %   Capital raised by initial public offerings listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market (in billions)   $ 17.4     $ 12.3     $ 15.0      Companies seeking to list securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market must meet minimum listing requirements, including specified financial and corporate governance criteria. Once listed, companies must meet continued listing standards. In July 2006, we introduced a new listing tier for public companies called The Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Nasdaq Global Select Market has the highest initial listing standards in the world. In conjunction with the creation of the new tier, we renamed The Nasdaq National Market, The Nasdaq Global Market. As a result, The Nasdaq Stock Market currently has three tiers of listed companies: The Nasdaq Global Select Market, The Nasdaq Global Market and The Nasdaq Capital Market. All three market tiers maintain rigorous listing and corporate governance standards and issuers listing on these markets have the opportunity to leverage an array of Nasdaq corporate services.    As of December 31, 2006, 1,187 companies listed securities on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, 1,479 companies listed securities on The Nasdaq Global Market and 527 companies listed securities on The Nasdaq     11    Table of Contents  Capital Market. During 2006, 285 new companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, with 19 listings on The Nasdaq Global Select Market and 216 on The Nasdaq Global Market. During 2005, 269 new companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, with 227 listings on The Nasdaq National Market. In addition, we had 323 foreign companies listed on our markets in 2006, and 343 in 2005.    After the initial listing, our Corporate Client Group provides customer support services, products and programs to Nasdaq-listed companies. To offer additional services to our listed companies, in 2005 we acquired Carpenter Moore and the remaining 50% interest in the Nasdaq Insurance Agency, LLC, independent insurance brokerage firms. In 2006, we acquired Shareholder.com, a firm specializing in shareholder communications and investor relations intelligence services and PrimeNewswire, a firm specializing in press release newswire and multimedia services. Additionally, we participate in a joint venture with Reuters called the Independent Research Network which aggregates multiple, independent research providers to distribute equity research on behalf of under-covered companies. See Note 3, “Business Combinations” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.    In 2006, UAL Corporation, the parent company of United Airlines, listed with The Nasdaq Stock Market. Additionally, Liberty Media Corporation, Innospec Inc., Computer Task Group, Inc. and E*TRADE Financial switched the listings of their securities from the NYSE to Nasdaq. Furthermore, 30 companies switched their listing from the Amex to The Nasdaq Stock Market in 2006. We also have attracted listings from foreign companies seeking to access U.S. capital markets, including CTC Media from Russia and the Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte, or OMA, from Mexico.    Since 2004, we have permitted NYSE-listed issuers to dually list their stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market. As of December 31, 2006, 10 companies dual listed securities on Nasdaq and NYSE. We continue to target companies about joining the dual-listing program.    Each year some companies cease listing with us for several reasons. In 2006, 303 companies ceased listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market compared with 332 in 2005. Companies cease listing for three primary reasons: failing to meet our listing standards, merger and acquisition activity and, to a lesser extent, switching to another listing venue. Delistings of issuers listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market during 2006 decreased by 9% compared with 2005.    We charge issuers an initial listing fee, a listing of additional shares fee and an annual fee. The initial listing fee for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market includes a listing application fee and a total shares outstanding fee. The fee for listing of additional shares is based on the total shares outstanding, which we review quarterly. Annual fees for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market are based on total shares outstanding. Initial listing and listing of additional shares fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods, which are six and four years, respectively, based on our historical listing experience, pursuant to the requirements of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13: Revenue Recognition.    In February 2007, the SEC approved a new pricing structure for our annual listing fees. This new schedule generally increases the annual and listing of additional shares fees listed companies pay to us, as well as the initial listing fee to list on The Nasdaq Capital Market.    Financial Products Business. We develop and license Nasdaq-branded indexes, associated derivatives and financial products as part of Nasdaq Financial Products. We believe that these indexes and products leverage, extend and enhance the Nasdaq brand. License fees for our trademark licenses vary by product based on assets or number or underlying dollar value of contracts issued. In addition to generating licensing revenues for Nasdaq, these products, particularly mutual funds and ETFs, lead to increased investments in companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, which enhances our ability to attract new listings. In 2006, we launched 16 new indexes and firms have launched eight new ETFs on Nasdaq indexes.    12    Table of Contents Our flagship index, the Nasdaq-100 Index, includes the top 100 non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Nasdaq indexes are the basis for over 500 financial products in over 35 countries. Nasdaq licenses cash-settled options, futures and options on futures on its indexes as well as options and single stock futures on QQQ. In addition to license fees, we are reimbursed by the QQQ trust for marketing activities designed to promote the trust.    In 2006, the QQQ was one of the most actively traded ETFs in the world and the most actively traded listed equity security in the United States. During 2006, the QQQ’s average daily trading volume was 107.4 million shares and its average daily dollar volume was approximately $4.4 billion. During 2005, the QQQ’s average daily trading volume was 90.4 million shares and its average daily dollar volume was approximately $3.5 billion. As of December 31, 2006, the QQQ trust had issued approximately 416 million shares and assets under management had reached $18 billion.    Nasdaq Financial Products, through its Portal Market, facilitates the eligibility for clearing and settlement services at Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, or DTCC, of Portal/Rule 144A securities. In 2006, we continued to facilitate the processing service for Rule 144A eligible securities through Portal with nearly 2,700 applications processed. In 2007, subject to SEC approval, we plan to launch our Portal Trading System, a system allowing for online trading of securities pursuant to Rule 144A. The Portal Market will then be a comprehensive offering including capital formation, trading, data and financial products.    In October 2006, we announced an agreement with PowerShares Capital Management LLC, or PowerShares, that will transfer the sponsorship functions including sales, marketing and administration of our QQQ, EQQQ and BLDRs ETFs. These transactions are expected to close by June 2007 pending approval by the SEC and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. We will maintain our status as licensor of the QQQ and the EQQQ ETFs. Nasdaq will continue to receive license fees from both these ETFs as they are benchmarked against the Nasdaq-100 Index.    The recent outcome of two court cases has impacted Nasdaq’s ability to collect licensing revenues, beginning in the third quarter of 2006, for options on ETFs that track our indexes (such as QQQ). In September 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed actions brought by McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones against an options market that threatened to trade options on ETFs based on their proprietary indexes without a license. This dismissal was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June 2006. The Second Circuit ruled that markets, in facilitating the trading of options on ETFs, are not misappropriating any intellectual property right of index providers. We are replacing this loss in revenues by continuing to develop, create, and license new indexes for financial instruments.    Fee Changes    We may change the pricing of our products and services in response to competitive pressures or changes in market or general economic conditions. Pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act, Nasdaq must file all proposals for a change in its pricing structure with the SEC. We provide updated information on the pricing of our products and services on our website at www.nasdaqtrader.com. See also “—Competition” and “Risk Factors—We face significant competition in our business.”    Technology    Over the past five years, we have reduced our technology costs, consistent with our regulatory obligations, by migrating to fewer, less expensive technology platforms, introducing less expensive network solutions, and by reducing our workforce. Our transaction speed throughput and system reliability has been enhanced by our migration to the INET platform.    The Nasdaq Market Center systems are located in a processing complex in our Northeast data center. The systems have handled trade volume of over 3 billion shares daily and over 64,000 transactions per second and are     13    Table of Contents  designed to maximize transaction reliability and network security across each of the most critical system services that comprise The Nasdaq Stock Market. In addition, our systems have the ability to handle increased capacity. To maximize reliability, we have developed a backup system in the event the primary systems are unable to perform.    Market data from our quote and trade execution systems are transferred via high-speed communications links to a market data repository and are available for real-time analysis, historical analysis, market surveillance and regulation, and data mining. The information is provided to applications and users through relational databases, higher-level access facilities and Internet applications.    Intellectual Property    We own or have licensed rights to trade names, trademarks, domain names and service marks that we use in conjunction with our operations and services. We have registered many of our most important trademarks in the United States and in foreign countries. For example, our primary “NASDAQ” mark is a registered trademark in the United States and in over 50 other countries worldwide. We also maintain copyright protection in our Nasdaq-branded materials and pursue patent protection for Nasdaq-developed inventions and processes. We currently have six issued United States patents and approximately 70 pending applications, some of which also are filed in foreign jurisdictions.    Industry    The equity exchange industry provides services, including securities listing, market information and trade execution, both in the United States and internationally.    Trade Execution Function. The principal market centers for buying and selling equity securities in the United States are The Nasdaq Stock Market, other national securities exchanges, including the NYSE and Amex, the regional stock exchanges and ECNs (sometimes referred to as alternative trading systems). These market centers employ different business models for displaying current bids, offers and orders for the purchase and sale of securities and for executing those bids, offers and orders against each other.    Unlike specialist-based auction markets, such as the NYSE and Amex, The Nasdaq Market Center, our transaction-based electronic platform, is a fully computerized, screen-based system that links over 230 competing market makers who commit capital and buy inventory to sell to market participants from their own account. The average Nasdaq-listed stock has over 24 market makers, who are required at all times to post their bid and offer prices into The Nasdaq Market Center, where the bids and offers can be reviewed and accessed for automatic execution by all market participants. In addition, our system provides a mechanism for all market participants (i.e., both order entry firms and market makers) to post non-marketable limit orders and to access posted limit orders both for their own account and when representing their customers on an agency basis, further enhancing liquidity in The Nasdaq Market Center.    Nasdaq-listed securities trade not just through The Nasdaq Market Center, but also through other market centers such the Amex, ECNs and regional exchanges. Currently, Nasdaq-listed securities trade on several ECNs and regional exchanges and are reported to Amex, the Chicago Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Boston Stock Exchange, the International Securities Exchange, the National Stock Exchange, NASD’s Alternative Display Facility, NYSE Arca, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, and to trade reporting facilities operated by the National Stock Exchange and Nasdaq under the regulatory oversight of the NASD.    We also earn data revenues based on our share of trading securities listed on the NYSE and Amex via The Nasdaq Market Center. The market centers other than Nasdaq that execute and report trades in NYSE-listed securities through the CTA Plan include the NYSE, NYSE Arca, Amex, the Boston Stock Exchange, the Chicago Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the National Stock Exchange, International Securities     14    Table of Contents  Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. With the acquisition of INET, we are now the largest order flow provider to the floor of the NYSE. We offer efficiencies in our business model that have enabled us recently to increase our trading volume in NYSE-listed securities.    Competition among market centers for trading volume is intense because trading volume is highly portable, with broker-dealers’ systems enabling simultaneous access to liquidity across all venues and order routing to the destination offering the best price or execution service.    Market Data Function. Nasdaq serves as a central consolidator of basic real-time quote and trade data for Nasdaq-listed securities. We act jointly with other national securities exchanges to collect and disseminate a consolidated stream of quotation and transaction information under national market system plans approved by the SEC, the CTA Plan or the CQ Plan, in the case of non-Nasdaq-listed securities, and the UTP Plan, in the case of Nasdaq-listed securities. The information collected under these national market system plans is sold for a fee to data vendors, who in turn sell the information to the public. These fees are referred to as “tape fees.” After costs are deducted, the tape fees are distributed among the participants in each of the national market system plans based on their transaction volume. Some regional exchanges, such as the National Stock Exchange, have established programs to share the tape fee revenue they received under the UTP Plan with market participants that execute and/or report trades in securities through their facilities, in order to increase their share of tape fee revenue. Nasdaq also implemented a program to share the tape fee revenue it earns from the UTP, CTA and CQ Plans.    In addition to sharing revenue under the data plans, the Exchange and the other registered national securities exchanges provide proprietary data to the investing public. Because our systems are electronic and inclusive in nature, we are able to provide a level of market transparency to all investors that is only available to a small segment of the investing population in a floor-based or a hybrid model.    Regulation NMS will change the method for sharing market data revenues under the plans. The changes will introduce a quote component to the sharing methodology. Regulation NMS also requires the creation of advisory committees composed of non-SRO representatives to the data plans, and authorizes market centers to distribute their own trade data independently of the data plans.    Listing Function. Registered national securities exchanges provide a venue for issuers to list securities for trading. The Nasdaq Stock Market and the NYSE and, to a lesser extent, Amex are the primary listing venues for equity securities in the United States. A total of 3,193 companies were listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market as of December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 2,764 listed on NYSE.    There is substantial competition for listings from companies that are selling shares for the first time through an IPO. Of the 206 IPOs on U.S. equity markets during 2006, 137, or approximately 67%, chose to list on The Nasdaq Stock Market, raising approximately $17.4 billion in equity capital. The remainder listed on the NYSE or other markets.    There is also substantial competition among the markets to encourage companies to switch listing venues or to list on more than one venue. In 2004, Nasdaq implemented an initiative to allow companies to list their stock both on the Exchange and the other markets. Since announcing this “dual-listing” service, several high profile companies have dual-listed on the Exchange, including American Financial Group, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Harmony Gold, and Walgreens. In addition, during 2006, four NYSE-listed companies switched their listing to Nasdaq, including E*TRADE Financial, Liberty Media Corporation, Innospec Inc. and Computer Task Group, Inc. Nasdaq also lists former NYSE companies such as UAL Corporation and Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc.    Recent Trends. The liberalization and globalization of world markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital, greater international participation in local markets and more competition among markets in different geographical areas. As a result, the competition among U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based markets and other execution venues has become more intense. The increased globalization of world markets also has increased the need for regulatory cooperation between markets in different jurisdictions.    15    Table of Contents In the last several years, the structure of the securities industry also has changed significantly through demutualizations and consolidations. In response to growing competition, many marketplaces in the United States and globally have demutualized to provide greater flexibility for future growth. As exchanges have demutualized and become for-profit public companies, profitability has become a significant driving factor. For profit-exchanges have focused on achieving economies of scale, ever improving technology and greater profitability through acquisitions and investments in new businesses. Broker-dealer investment in smaller regional exchanges as significant minority shareholders has been another consequence of demutualization. Globally, broker-dealers are demanding greater efficiency in trading equity securities, new sophisticated order types, seamless trading across asset classes and markets, and ever better performance of trading platforms.    Powerful business and regulatory factors also are causing the significant reorganization and restructuring of the equity securities industry through acquisitions, mergers, investments, and new entry, particularly in the transactions services area. The securities industry also is experiencing consolidation, creating a more intense competitive environment. Additionally, a high proportion of business in the securities market is becoming increasingly concentrated in a smaller number of institutions. At the same time, recent initiatives, including Regulation NMS, encourage a reappraisal of the business models of equity exchanges and alternative electronic trading systems.    As the transactions services area has been undergoing significant transformation, registered national securities exchanges have been active in the reorganization of the industry. We acquired INET in December 2005 and Brut in September 2004. In March 2006, the NYSE acquired Archipelago Holdings, the parent of the Pacific Exchange and the Archipelago ECN, and its acquisition of Euronext is scheduled to be completed later this year. Also, in 2006, the Boston Stock Exchange created a new equities market, the Boston Equity Exchange, in partnership with several large broker-dealers. The International Securities Exchange, historically a derivatives exchange, entered the cash-equities exchange business in September 2006.    Competition    The equity securities markets are intensely competitive. We compete in our industry against the NYSE, Amex, regional exchanges and ECNs based on a number of factors, including the quality of our technological and regulatory infrastructure, total transaction costs, the depth and breadth of our markets, the quality of our value-added customer services, reputation and price.    The NYSE has introduced a “hybrid” system, which incorporates certain elements of an electronic system while retaining many elements of a traditional trading floor and continues to operate Archipelago as another trading system. In addition, the pending merger of NYSE and Euronext and the continuing trend toward global consolidation among the exchanges may be expected to result in competition on a more global scale. Should the NYSE’s merger with Euronext be completed, the NYSE has indicated that Euronext’s NSC trading system might eventually replace both the NYSE’s hybrid and Archipelago’s trading systems.    With the Nasdaq-INET and NYSE-Arca transactions completed, the marketplace is now being altered by the entry of new ECNs in the trade execution business and market participants’ acquisition and investment in existing ECNs or regional exchanges. For example, TradeBot launched the Better Alternative Trading System, or BATS ECN. Citigroup announced its acquisition of OnTrade, Inc. from NexTrade, and Knight Capital Group, Inc. acquired Attain (Direct Edge). Citadel Derivatives Group, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS purchased stakes in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Fidelity and Lehman Brothers invested in the Boston Stock Exchange to create a new electronic stock exchange, the Boston Equities Exchange. Additional new entrants may emerge, potentially posing a competitive threat to more established industry participants. While many of the new entrants have limited liquidity, some have attracted significant levels of equity order volume through aggressive pricing and, we believe, from volume originating with their broker-dealer investors. In addition, there remains interest in electronic trading systems specializing primarily in large block trades, such as LiquidNet, Pipeline Trading and Investment Technology Group’s POSIT platform.    16    Table of Contents Also, other regional exchanges, such as the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc., the National Stock Exchange and the International Securities Exchange have recently entered into investment agreements with other participants in the securities industry, with the objective of enabling them to better compete with other exchanges.    Equity Securities Trading. We experience competition in our core trading activities such as execution services, quoting and trading capabilities, and reporting services. Our principal competitors for trading equity securities include NYSE, Amex, the regional exchanges and ECNs. Many of our competitors have engaged in aggressive price competition by reducing the trade execution transaction fees they charge their customers. As a result of this competition, we significantly reduced the trade execution transaction fees we charge our customers during 2005, particularly our large-volume customers. In early 2006, in connection with our acquisition of INET, we adjusted our transaction fees to harmonize our pricing structure with INET, whose fees had been higher than ours. In late 2006 the BATS ECN announced a new pricing initiative featuring net negative execution fees which took effect in January 2007. In February 2007, we announced new equities pricing to harmonize the trading of Nasdaq-listed and non-Nasdaq-listed securities into one pricing schedule. Also, we announced a pricing change, effective March 1, 2007, that will lower access and routing fees for high volume customers. We periodically reexamine our pricing structure to ensure that our fees remain competitive.    Data Services. Our revenues from the sale of market information products and services are also under competitive threat from other securities exchanges that trade Nasdaq-listed securities. Current SEC regulations permit these regional exchanges and NASD’s Alternative Display Facility to quote and trade Nasdaq-listed securities. Trade reporting facilities regulated by the NASD are also operated by Nasdaq and one regional exchange and are proposed by other exchanges. Nasdaq’s UTP Plan entitles these exchanges, NASD’s Alternate Display Facility, and the trade reporting facilities to a share of UTP Plan tape fees, in proportion to such exchange’s share of trading as measured by share volume and number of trades. Participants in the UTP Plan have used tape fee revenues to establish payment for order flow arrangements with their members and customers. In January 2004, we implemented a new tiered pricing structure and the Nasdaq General Revenue Sharing Program, which provided incentives for quoting market participants to send orders and report trades to The Nasdaq Market Center. We continuously evaluate and refine both programs. To remain competitive, in July 2006, we changed the terms of the program and established a new Nasdaq Data Revenue Sharing Program. We may adjust either program in the future to respond to competitive pressures.    We are also responding aggressively to competition by updating and innovating new data products to provide market participants with increased functionality and new and more extensive market information.    Listings. Our primary competitor for larger company listings on The Nasdaq Stock Market is the NYSE. We also compete, to a limited extent, with the Amex for listing of smaller, less active companies. As result of the NYSE-Archipelago merger, the NYSE group is aggressively pursuing listings of smaller companies that have not historically qualified for listing on the NYSE for listing on its junior market. In addition, we face competition for listing of foreign companies.    Financial Products. Nasdaq-sponsored financial products are subject to intense competition from other ETFs, derivatives and structured products as investment alternatives. The source of this competition is not only large ETF family sponsors, but also, increasingly, other mutual fund sponsors originating ETFs.    Likewise, The Nasdaq Stock Market is subject to intense competition for the listing of these financial products from other exchanges. The indexes on which these products are based face competition from other indexes which can be considered competitive with Nasdaq indexes. For example, there are a number of indexes that aim to track the technology sector and may from time to time have a high degree of correlation with the Nasdaq-100 Index and Nasdaq Composite Index. We face competition from investment banks, markets or other product developers in designing products that meet investor needs.      17    Table of Contents Acquisition Strategy    We have grown our business through acquisitions in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Our strategy for acquisitions is to identify and acquire only those elements that are most important to our success. We integrated the key components of the Brut technology and the Brut team into Nasdaq in 2005 and recently completed the integration of INET and the migration of its customers to the INET platform. Also consistent with this focused approach, we acquired Carpenter Moore, Shareholder.com and PrimeNewswire to meet specific needs of listed companies and other customers. Additionally, we entered into a joint venture with Reuters to form Independent Research Network, which aggregates multiple, independent research providers to distribute equity research on behalf of under-covered companies.    We regularly explore and evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances, including assessing rating agency and regulatory implications, among other things, both in the United States and abroad, some of which could be material. We intend to pursue acquisitions and alliances with the objective of strengthening our current business and advancing our technology. In addition, we continue to evaluate implications of strategic transactions involving other industry participants both in the United States and abroad.    Regulation    Federal securities laws establish a two-tiered system for the regulation of securities markets, market participants and listed companies. The SEC occupies the first tier and has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws. SROs, which are non-governmental organizations, occupy the second tier. The Exchange is an SRO. Self-regulatory organizations, such as national securities exchanges, are registered with the SEC and are subject to the SEC’s extensive regulation and oversight.    This regulatory framework applies to our business in the following ways:        •    regulation of The Nasdaq Stock Market; and        •    regulation of our broker-dealer subsidiaries.    The rules and regulations that apply to our business are focused primarily on safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and of market participants and investors generally. While we believe that regulation improves the quality of The Nasdaq Stock Market and, therefore, our company, these rules and regulations are not focused on the protection of our stockholders. Federal securities laws and the rules that govern our operations are subject to frequent change. Any subsequent change in law or regulation, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and operating results.    SEC and Self-Regulatory Organization Regulation. With exchange registration, we received our own SRO status through our exchange subsidiary, separate from that of NASD. As an SRO, we have our own rules pertaining to our members and listed companies regarding listing, membership and trading that are distinct and separate from those rules applicable to broker-dealers that are administered by NASD. Broker-dealers may choose to become members of the Exchange, in addition to their other SRO memberships, including membership in NASD.     As the operator of a national securities exchange, virtually all facets of our operations are subject to the SEC’s oversight, as prescribed by the Exchange Act, and we are subject to periodic and special examinations by the SEC. We also are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the SEC or other interested parties at any time in connection with alleged regulatory violations. We have been subject to a number of routine reviews and inspections by the SEC. To the extent such actions or reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes, we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business, which may adversely affect our business. We are also subject to Section 17 of the Exchange Act, which imposes record-keeping requirements, including the requirement to make certain records available to the SEC for examination.    18    Table of Contents Section 19 of the Exchange Act provides that we must submit proposed changes to any of the SRO rules, practices and procedures, including revisions to provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws that constitute SRO rules, to the SEC. The SEC will typically publish the proposal for public comment, following which the SEC may approve or disapprove the proposal, as it deems appropriate. The SEC’s action is designed to ensure that applicable SRO rules and procedures are consistent with the aims of the Exchange Act and its rules and regulations. If the SEC disapproves a proposal that we have submitted, it could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act, we must file all proposals for a change in our pricing structure with the SEC.    SROs in the securities industry are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors. The Exchange Act and the rules thereunder impose on the SROs many regulatory and operational responsibilities, including the day-to-day responsibilities for market and broker-dealer oversight. In general, an SRO is responsible for regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules and regulations governing the business conduct of its members.    We sought to preserve a regulatory separation upon operation as a national securities exchange. NASD Regulation, Inc., or NASDR, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NASD, provides regulatory services to the Exchange, including the regulation of trading activity on The Nasdaq Stock Market and surveillance and investigative functions. We have a limited direct regulatory role in conducting real-time market monitoring through our MarketWatch department. This department, among other things, monitors for trades whose prices are away from the current market and initiates trading halts as necessary. Suspicious trading behavior discovered by MarketWatch staff and all other Nasdaq employees is referred to NASD for further investigation. NASD performs the surveillance and investigative functions for Nasdaq. We have preserved this regulatory separation now that we are operational as a national securities exchange.    We have additional regulatory functions related to companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market that are handled by our Listing Qualifications department. This department is responsible for maintaining a compliance-monitoring and enforcement program with respect to our requirements for initial and continued listing. Companies that wish to list on The Nasdaq Stock Market are required to satisfy a variety of quantitative and qualitative requirements to become listed and to continue to be listed, including all our corporate governance listing standards. Companies that fail to maintain compliance with these requirements are subject to delisting. To provide regulatory transparency and assist issuers in maintaining compliance, our Listing Qualifications department provides written interpretations with respect to the application of our listing requirements and maintains a website providing interpretive guidance.    When we transferred our own listing from the OTC Bulletin Board, or OTCBB, to the Nasdaq National Market in 2005, the SEC approved special listing standards with respect to listing our common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market. These listing standards require periodic reporting of compliance to the SEC and an annual compliance audit by an independent accounting firm. Our failure to maintain compliance with these listing standards could result in our common stock being delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market.    Broker-Dealer Regulation. Nasdaq’s broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the SEC, the SROs and the various state securities regulators. We acquired three broker-dealers, Brut, LLC, INET ATS, Inc. and Island Execution Services, LLC, in connection with recent acquisitions. In February 2006, INET ATS, Inc., the entity operating INET ECN, was merged into Brut, LLC, with Brut, LLC as the surviving entity. Subsequently, Brut, LLC was renamed Nasdaq Execution Services, LLC. Nasdaq Execution Services, LLC currently operates as our routing broker for sending orders from The Nasdaq Market Center to other venues for execution. In 2006, Island Execution Services, LLC was renamed NASDAQ Options Services, LLC. NASDAQ Options Services currently has no trading operations.    Nasdaq Execution Services is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. It is also a member of the NYSE, NASD, American Stock Exchange, Boston Stock     19    Table of Contents  Exchange, Chicago Stock Exchange, International Securities Exchange, Pacific Stock Exchange, Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange. NASDAQ Options Services is a member of the NASD and the National Stock Exchange.    The SEC, NYSE and NASD adopt rules and examine broker-dealers and require strict compliance with their rules and regulations. The SEC, SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings which can result in censures, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or employees. The SEC and state regulators may also institute proceedings against broker-dealers seeking an injunction or other sanction. The SEC and SRO rules cover many aspects of a broker-dealer’s business, including capital structure and withdrawals, sales methods, trade practices among broker-dealers, use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, record-keeping, the financing of customers’ purchases, broker-dealer and employee registration and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. All broker-dealers have an SRO that is assigned by the SEC as the broker-dealer’s designated examining authority, or DEA. The DEA is responsible for examining a broker-dealer for compliance with the SEC’s financial responsibility rules. NYSE is Nasdaq Execution Services’ current DEA and the NASD is NASDAQ Options Services’ DEA. A failure to comply with the SEC’s request in a satisfactory manner may have adverse consequences and changing Nasdaq Execution Services’ DEA may entail additional regulatory costs.    In August 2006, Nasdaq Execution Services settled a regulatory matter with NASD regarding compliance with Nasdaq Execution Services’ obligations regarding short sales, firm quotes and other reporting and disclosure requirements. Nasdaq Execution Services paid a fine of $2.2 million to NASD.    As registered broker-dealer subsidiaries, Nasdaq Execution Services and NASDAQ Options Services are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity, which requires that they comply with certain minimum capital requirements. The SEC and NASD impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, dictate the ratio of debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the Uniform Net Capital Rule and NASD rules impose certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC and NASD for certain withdrawals of capital.    As of December 31, 2006, Nasdaq Execution Services was required to maintain minimum net capital of $0.3 million and had total net capital of approximately $38.4 million, or $38.1 million in excess of the minimum amount required. As of December 31, 2006, NASDAQ Options Services was required to maintain minimum net capital of $0.3 million and had total net capital of approximately $1.7 million, or $1.4 million in excess of the minimum amount required.    Regulation NMS. Regulation NMS, which was adopted in 2005 and is scheduled to be fully implemented in 2007, has been one of the key drivers behind the changes in the execution services and market data businesses in the United States. The most significant provisions of Regulation NMS are order protection, referred to as the “best price” rule, and fair access. The best price rule requires exchanges and other trading centers to establish procedures designed to prevent the execution of trades at prices inferior to protected quotations displayed by other trading centers. Many market centers have announced plans to adopt electronic trading capabilities, which Nasdaq has had in place for many years. In particular, the NYSE has implemented the “hybrid” system, which incorporates some elements of an electronic system while retaining many elements of a traditional trading floor.     As a result of the best price rule, market participants will be required to route order flow to market centers with the best execution performance, including liquidity, reliability and speed. We believe that Nasdaq is well positioned to benefit from this provision of Regulation NMS, because we have long been a fully automated market and have a deep liquidity pool. We expect the best price rule will have a significant impact on the trading of securities, particularly non-Nasdaq-listed securities. Electronic trading is expected to result in increased average daily trading volumes as trading becomes fully automated.    20    Table of Contents Under the best price rule, each exchange must interact with the market center offering the best price before it can execute a trade at an inferior price on its systems. We believe that Regulation NMS is likely to remove many of the delays and impediments to trading NYSE- and Amex-listed securities through Nasdaq that existed under the trade through rule of the Intermarket Trading System. Accordingly, we withdrew from the Intermarket Trading System in 2006. We will rely instead upon faster private linkages with greater capacity to comply with the order protection and fair access rules.    The fair access rule requires market centers to provide fair and non-discriminatory access to quotations, establishes a limit on access fees to harmonize the pricing of quotations across different trading centers and requires all exchanges to maintain written rules that prohibit their members from displaying quotations that lock or cross automated quotations. We expect this rule will benefit Nasdaq because we have fast and reliable automated access into all market centers and a system that will permit compliance with the rules regarding the locking or crossing automatic quotations.    Regulation NMS also contains a market information rule that updates the requirements for consolidating, distributing and displaying market information. This rule amends the CTA, CQ and UTP Plans for disseminating market information to modify the formulas for allocating plan revenues and to broaden participation in plan governance. Finally, the sub-penny rule prohibits market participants from displaying quotations in pricing increments smaller than a penny, with exceptions for quotes and orders priced at less than $1.00 per share.    The changes in the competitive landscape driven by these rules could have far reaching and unforeseeable impacts on our businesses. The best price rule and the fair access rule will apply to a small group of stocks beginning in May 2007, with implementation for all securities required by October 2007. The market information rule is scheduled to apply beginning in April 2007, and the sub-penny pricing rule took effect on January 31, 2006.   Regulatory Contractual Relationships with NASDR    Regulatory Services Agreement. NASDR provides us with regulatory services, including the regulation of trading activity on the Exchange and the surveillance and investigative functions of the Exchange, pursuant to a regulatory services agreement and a transitional regulatory agreement discussed below. The regulatory services agreement became effective for Nasdaq-listed securities on August 1, 2006 and is anticipated to become effective for non-Nasdaq-listed securities in March 2007. In December 2006, we entered into a transitional regulatory services agreement with NASD under which NASD provides regulatory services with respect to our systems for trading non-Nasdaq-listed securities. Prior to the effective dates of the regulatory services agreement and transitional services agreement, NASDR provided regulatory services to us pursuant to the Delegation Plan. We paid NASDR $33.8 million for 2006 and $41.7 million for 2005 for regulatory services.   Under the regulatory services agreement, NASDR will provide regulatory services to us for ten years commencing August 1, 2006. The services are of the same type and scope as were provided by NASDR to us under the Delegation Plan. Each regulatory service is to be provided for a minimum of five years, then the parties may determine to terminate a particular service. The termination of a particular service will generally be based upon a review of pricing and the need for such services. Under the agreement, NASDR bills us a fee for each required service provided that it is based on NASDR’s direct and indirect costs plus a markup of six percent on compensation costs related to NASDR’s employees used to provide the services. Any services other than those required by the agreement are billed at cost, plus a mutually agreed upon markup.    Under the regulatory services agreement, NASDR:        •    reviews and approves new member applications;        •    performs automated surveillance of trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market;    21    Table of Contents     •    reviews member firm compliance with the rules and regulations applicable to trading and market-making functions in The Nasdaq Stock Market;        •    investigates suspicious activity in quoting and trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market;        •    conducts examinations of member firms;        •    initiates the disciplinary process once it is determined that a potential violation of a federal securities law or rule, or an SRO rule, may have occurred; and        •    operates an arbitration program and a mediation program for the resolution of customer, member firm employee, and Nasdaq member-to-member disputes.    For further discussion of these agreements and our other related party transactions, see “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”    The transitional regulatory services agreement with NASD, which we entered into in connection with the removal of the Exchange from the Delegation Plan, will be in place from December 2006 until the partial implementation of Regulation NMS in March 2007. The transitional regulatory services agreement is substantially similar to the existing regulatory services agreement. Under the transitional agreement, NASD provides regulatory services with respect to systems for trading non-Nasdaq-listed securities and charges Nasdaq in accordance with the procedures that had existed under the Delegation Plan.    Employees    As of February 21, 2007, Nasdaq had 898 employees. None of its employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements or is represented by a union. Nasdaq considers its relations with its employees to be good.    Nasdaq Website and Availability of SEC Filings    We file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

Risk Factors    The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Nasdaq. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or operating results could be adversely affected.    22    Table of Contents Our high leverage limits our financial flexibility.    We have a significant amount of debt. Our indebtedness as of December 31, 2006 was approximately $1.5 billion and we may borrow up to an additional $75.0 million under our revolver and up to an additional $400 million under our swingline facility, subject to meeting certain conditions. This significant leverage may:        •    impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for refinancing indebtedness, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, or other purposes;        •    reduce funds available to us for our operations and general corporate purposes or for capital expenditures as a result of the dedication of a substantial portion of our consolidated cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;        •    place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors with less debt;        •    increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions; and        •    curtail our flexibility to respond to changing economic or competitive conditions or to make acquisitions.    Our significant debt resulted in the downgrading of our credit rating by Moody’s and by Standard & Poor’s in the second quarter of 2006. In addition, on November 28, 2006, as a result of the significant debt we would have incurred in connection with our lapsed offers for the remaining LSE share capital, Standard & Poor’s cut our long-term counterparty credit rating to BB from BB+.    In addition, we must comply with the covenants in our credit facilities. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to grant liens, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, sell assets, make certain payments, conduct transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate. Failure to meet any of the covenant terms of our credit facilities could result in an event of default. If an event of default occurs, and we are unable to receive a waiver of default, our lenders may increase our borrowing costs, restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings, accelerate all amounts outstanding or enforce their interest against all collateral pledged. The Exchange’s convertible notes also contain a covenant restricting our ability to incur debt senior to the convertible notes and as a consequence of the current debt outstanding under our credit facilities, the Exchange’s convertible notes would not permit us to incur additional debt senior to the convertible notes.    Future acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures may require significant resources and/or result in significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities.    Over the past three years, acquisitions, including the acquisitions of INET ECN and Nasdaq Execution Services, LLC (formerly Brut, LLC), have been a significant factor in our growth. Although we cannot predict our rate of growth as a result of acquisitions, we believe that additional acquisitions or entering into partnership and joint ventures are important to our growth strategy. Many of the other potential purchasers of assets in our industry have greater financial resources than we have. Therefore, we cannot be sure that we will be able to complete future acquisitions on terms favorable to us.    We may finance future acquisitions by issuing additional equity and/or debt. The issuance of additional equity in connection with any transaction could be substantially dilutive to existing stockholders. The issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially. In addition, announcement or implementation of future transactions by us or others could have a material effect on the price of our stock. We could face financial risks associated with incurring additional debt, particularly if the debt resulted in significant incremental leverage. Additional debt may reduce our liquidity, curtail our access to financing markets, impact our standing with the credit agencies and increase the cash flow required for debt service. Any incremental debt incurred to finance an acquisition could also place significant constraints on the operation of our business. We may not be able to meet those restrictions.    23    Table of Contents These equity, debt and managerial commitments may impair the operation of our businesses. Furthermore, any future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail a number of additional risks, including:        •    problems with effective integration of operations;        •    the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;        •    increased operating costs;        •    the diversion of our management team from our other operations;        •    problems with regulatory bodies;        •    exposure to unanticipated liabilities;        •    difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings;        •    possible tax costs or inefficiencies associated with a future acquisition, including overpaying for a future acquisition; and        •    changes in our credit rating and financing costs.    We must continue to invest in our operations to integrate prior transactions and to maintain and grow our business, and we may need additional funds to do so.    We depend on the availability of adequate capital to maintain and develop our business. We believe that we can meet our current capital requirements from internally generated funds, cash on hand and available borrowings. However, if we are unable to fund our capital requirements as currently planned, there would be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    Should we need to raise funds through incurring additional debt, we may become subject to covenants even more restrictive than those contained in our current debt instruments. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity our equity holders may suffer dilution. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms or at all.    We face significant competition in our business.    The securities trading business is highly competitive. We face competition from numerous entities in the securities trading industry, including competition for listings and trading services from other exchanges and market centers. Such competition also includes pricing competition. In addition, competition could increase as a result of the registration of new exchanges in the United States, Regulation NMS and globalization in the industry. The following factors are some of the risks associated with competition that may affect our business and results of operations:    Price competition has affected and could continue to affect our business.    The securities trading industry is characterized by intense price competition. We have in the past lowered prices and increased rebates to attempt to gain market share. These strategies have not always been successful and have at times hurt operating performance. Additionally, we have also been, and may once again be, required to adjust pricing to respond to actions by competitors, which has adversely impacted operating results. We have recently taken steps to rationalize our pricing. This rationalization of our pricing may adversely affect our market share.    Price competition with respect to market data rebates or our program relating to sharing revenues associated with trading Nasdaq-listed securities could attract trading volume away from us, leading to loss of market share and decreased revenues.    24    Table of Contents Globalization, growth, consolidations and other strategic arrangements may impair our competitive position.    The liberalization and globalization of world markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital, greater international participation in local markets and more competition among markets in different geographical areas. As a result, the competition among U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based markets and other execution venues has become more intense.    In addition, in the last several years, the structure of the securities industry has changed significantly through demutualizations and consolidations. In response to growing competition, many marketplaces in both Europe and the United States have demutualized to provide greater flexibility for future growth. The securities industry is also experiencing consolidation, creating a more intense competitive environment. Also, a high proportion of business in the securities market is becoming increasingly concentrated in a smaller number of institutions and our revenue may therefore become concentrated in a smaller number of customers.    We face competition from new competitors in the securities trading industry. Examples of these new competitors include:        •    The Boston Stock Exchange, Inc., the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc., the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc, the National Stock Exchange and the International Securities Exchange have all recently entered into investment agreements with other participants in the securities industry, with the objective of enabling them to better compete with other exchanges;        •    Knight Capital Group, Inc., a market maker in Nasdaq-listed securities, has acquired Attain ECN, a Nasdaq competitor now operating as Direct Edge;        •    TradeBot Systems launched the BATS ECN;        •    Citigroup Inc. announced plans to launch its own electronic stock-trading network from its acquisition of OnTrade Inc., an ECN previously operated by NexTrade Holdings Inc.;        •    NYSE’s potential entry in trading Nasdaq-listed securities;        •    ISE began trading cash equities; and        •    Philadelphia Stock Exchange recently began trading Nasdaq-listed securities.    Because of these market trends, we face intense competition. If we are unable to compete successfully in this environment, our business, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.    In addition, we believe Regulation NMS may enhance competition in Nasdaq-listed securities from these or other new competitors. Additionally, new ECNs may develop trading platforms that are more competitive than ours. Finally, there has been increased use of electronic trading systems specializing in large volume trades, such as LiquidNet, Pipeline Trading and Investment Technology Group’s POSIT platform, which may divert trading volume from The Nasdaq Market Center. If these or other trading venues are successful, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Also, our trade reporting facility (which we operate jointly with the NASD for the purpose of accepting reports of off-exchange trades) faces competition from the trade reporting facilities operated jointly with NASD by the National Stock Exchange, and soon, the Boston Stock Exchange and NYSE.    Recent mergers and acquisitions activity of NYSE.    The recent merger of NYSE and Archipelago as well as the NYSE’s announced merger with Euronext will create strong competition for us, particularly if NYSE is able to create its own electronic trading platform or migrate its trading business to Archipelago’s platform and if NYSE is able to attract new overseas listings. NYSE     25    Table of Contents  is developing electronic trading capabilities that will compete directly with ours. In addition, the merger with Archipelago has given NYSE access to ArcaEx’s electronic systems. If NYSE’s trading volume increases to our detriment as a result of the merger with Archipelago, it would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, the proposed merger of NYSE and Euronext could result in a stronger competitor for us than NYSE and Euronext as stand-alone businesses. If the NYSE/Euronext merger is consummated and they are able to compete for additional overseas listings to our detriment, it would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.    We face significant competition in our securities trading business, which could reduce our transactions, trade reporting and market information revenues and negatively impact our financial results.    We compete for trading of Nasdaq-, NYSE- and Amex-listed securities. Any decision by market participants to quote, execute or report trades through exchanges, ECNs or the Alternative Display Facility maintained by NASD could have a negative impact on our share of quotes and trades in securities traded through The Nasdaq Market Center. Any reduction in our share of trades or quotes would reduce our share of tape revenue from the UTP and CTA plans under Regulation NMS and could reduce the value of our proprietary data products.    While we trade a large percentage of securities of Nasdaq-listed companies, we face strong competition from other exchanges and emerging players in the market. For non-Nasdaq-listed securities, the other national exchanges offer significant level of liquidity in many non-Nasdaq-listed securities. Accordingly, we face major obstacles in continuing to grow our trading volume in non-Nasdaq-listed securities.    Our responses to competition may not be sufficient to regain lost business or prevent other market participants from shifting some of their quoting and/or trade reporting to other industry participants. We may need to reduce prices to remain competitive. Our inability to compete for transactions, trade reporting and market information revenues could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    We must adapt to significant competition in our listing businesses.    We face significant competition in our listing businesses from other exchanges. Historically, NYSE has been our largest competitor, and we have competed with NYSE primarily for listings of larger domestic and international companies. In addition, on occasion, issuers may transfer their listings from us to other venues. Significant transfers could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.    Our revenues may be affected by competition in the business for financial products.    We continue to develop our financial products business, which creates indexes and licenses them for Nasdaq-branded financial products. Nasdaq-sponsored financial products are subject to intense competition from other ETFs, derivatives and structured products as investment alternatives. Our revenues may be adversely affected by increasing competition from competitors’ financial products designed to replicate or correlate with the performance of our financial products. In addition, the legal and regulatory climate, which supports the licensing of these financial products, has changed in a manner which is likely to adversely impact our ability to successfully license our products. In September 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed actions brought by McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones against an options market that threatened to trade options on ETFs without a license. This dismissal was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June 2006. The Second Circuit ruled that markets, in facilitating the trading of options on ETFs, are not misappropriating any intellectual property right of index providers. Further, many other entrants have recently emerged who not only compete with us for future growth opportunities, but who may also introduce products that erode the position of our current offerings, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results.    A decrease in trading volume will decrease our trading revenues.    Trading volume is directly affected by economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, changes in price levels of securities and the overall level of investor confidence. Weak economic     26    Table of Contents  conditions or a reduction in securities prices could result in a decline in trading volume. A decline in trading volume would lower revenues and may adversely affect our operating results. We are particularly affected by declines in trading volume in technology-related securities because a significant portion of our customers trade in these types of securities and a large number of the companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market are in the technology sector. In addition, investor confidence and trader interest, and thus trading volume, can be affected by factors outside our control, such as the publicity surrounding investigations and prosecutions for corporate governance or accounting irregularities at public companies.    Declines in the initial public offering market have an adverse effect on our revenues.    Stagnation or decline in the initial public offering market will impact the number of new listings on The Nasdaq Stock Market, and thus our related revenues. We recognize revenue from new listings on a straight-line basis over an estimated six-year service period. As a result of the decline in the IPO market from 2000-2002, our deferred revenue associated with those years will be lower than our deferred revenue associated with the periods from 2003 to the present.    Losses in listings could cause a reduction in revenues.    While the reduction in initial listings or the loss of one or more large issuers could decrease listing revenues, it could cause an even more significant decrease in revenues from the quoting, reporting and trading of those issuers’ securities. If the combined NYSE/Euronext is successful in competing with us for core listings, we would lose not only the listing fees associated with those companies, but also a substantial amount of the trade execution fees generated by trading in those companies’ securities.    We may experience fluctuations in our operating results.    The financial services industry is risky and unpredictable and is directly affected by many national and international factors beyond our control. Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results by causing a substantial decline in the financial services markets and reduced trading volume.    Our revenue, margins and operating results have varied in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future, making them difficult to predict. These difficulties are particularly exacerbated in light of our recent acquisitions and the uncertainties surrounding the benefits and costs associated with integration. Additionally, since our borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and we do not have interest rate hedges in place on this debt, any increase in interest rates will increase our interest expense and reduce our cash flow. Other than variable rate debt, we believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnifies the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results. As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a relatively larger impact on operating results. A substantial portion of our operating expenses will be related to personnel costs, regulation and corporate overhead, none of which can be adjusted quickly and some of which cannot be adjusted at all. Our operating expense levels are based on our expectations for future revenue. If actual revenue is below management’s expectations, or if our expenses increase before revenues do, both gross margins and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. Because of these actions, it is possible that our operating results or other operating metrics may fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors. If this happens, the market price of our common stock is likely to decline.    We must control our costs to remain profitable.    We base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services. A decline in our products and services may reduce our revenues without a corresponding decline in our expenses since we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis. Our ability to manage and estimate our     27    Table of Contents  costs will be particularly challenging as a result of recent acquisitions and integration efforts. Failure to achieve our goals on cost savings will have an adverse impact on our results of operations.    Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.    One of our competitive strengths is our strong reputation and brand name. Various issues may give rise to reputational risk, including issues relating to:        •    the representation of our business in the media;        •    the accuracy of our financial statements and other financial and statistical information;        •    the quality of our corporate governance structure; and        •    the quality of our products, including the reliability of our transaction-based business, the accuracy of the quote and trade information provided by our market information services business and the accuracy of calculations used by our financial products business for indices and unit investment trusts.    Damage to our reputation could cause some issuers not to list their securities on our exchange as well as reduce the trading volume on our exchange or cause us to lose customers in our market information services or financial products businesses. This, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    The value of our LSE investment could decline due to fluctuations in LSE’s stock price, the foreign currency exchange rate and payment of dividends.    The market value of our investment in the LSE is subject to market price volatility. We currently do not have any hedges on our investments, including our investment in the LSE. To the extent that we have not hedged our exposure to a decrease in the value of these securities, the value of our LSE investment could decrease. To the extent we do not hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, we also are subject to the risk of fluctuations in the exchange rate related to our investment.    Although we received dividends of $16.2 million in 2006, there is no guarantee that LSE will pay dividends to shareholders in future periods or that any dividends will be in comparable amounts.    LSE is subject to certain risks.    LSE suffers many of the same risks we suffer. To the extent these risks affect the future performance of the LSE businesses and, in turn, the market price of LSE share capital, the value of our investment in LSE could be materially affected.    We may not be able keep up with rapid technological and other competitive changes affecting our industry.    The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent enhancements to existing products and services, the introduction of new services and products and changing customer demands. If our platform fails to function as expected, our business would be negatively affected. In addition, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully develop, introduce, or market new services and products or if we need to adopt costly and customized technology for our services and products. In addition, our failure to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences, or any significant delays in product development efforts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    System limitations, failures or security breaches could harm our business.    Our business depends on the integrity and performance of the computer and communications systems supporting us. If our systems cannot expand to cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform, we     28    Table of Contents  could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and services. These consequences could result in lower trading volumes, financial losses, decreased customer service and satisfaction and regulatory sanctions. We have experienced occasional systems failures and delays in the past and could experience future systems failures and delays. Under the Exchange’s limitation of liability rule, we, subject to certain caps, may provide compensation for losses due to malfunctions of our order-execution systems.    If our trading volume increases unexpectedly, we will need to expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure. We do not know whether we will be able to accurately project the rate, timing, or cost of any increases, or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate any increases in a timely manner.    Our systems and operations also are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, natural disasters, power loss, sabotage or terrorism, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, security breaches, outages and similar events. We have active and aggressive programs in place to identify and minimize our exposure to these vulnerabilities and work in collaboration with the technology industry to share corrective measures with our business partners. Although we currently maintain multiple computer facilities that are designed to provide redundancy and back-up to reduce the risk of system disruptions and have facilities in place that are expected to maintain service during a system disruption, such systems and facilities may prove inadequate. Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our services could impair our reputation, damage our brand name and negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.    The adoption and implementation of Regulation NMS by the SEC could adversely affect our business.    On April 6, 2005, the SEC adopted Regulation NMS. Regulation NMS’s four primary components are: the Order Protection Rule, the Access Rule, the Market Data Rule and the Sub-Penny Rule. The major provisions of Regulation NMS will continue to be phased in over the course of 2007. We may incur technological and other costs in changing our systems and operations so that we can comply with these rules. We may also lose revenues due to a new formula under Regulation NMS for allocating market data revenue under the National Market System plans. Additionally, the impact of Regulation NMS is hard to predict and there may be problems or competitive challenges that we do not foresee that adversely affect our business as Regulation NMS is implemented. Finally, there is also a risk that the rules may materially change during implementation which would undermine business plans and investments that have been made based on the current form of the rules.    Regulatory changes and changes in market structure could have a material adverse effect on our business.    We operate in a highly regulated industry. In recent years, the securities trading industry and, in particular, the securities markets, have been subject to significant regulatory changes. Moreover, the securities markets have been the subject of increasing governmental and public scrutiny in response to a number of recent developments and inquiries. Any of these factors or events may result in future regulatory or other changes, although we cannot predict the nature of these changes or their impact on our business at this time. Our customers also operate in a highly regulated industry. The SEC and other regulatory authorities could impose regulatory changes that could impact the ability of our customers to use The Nasdaq Market Center or could adversely affect The Nasdaq Stock Market. The loss of a significant number of customers or a reduction in trading activity on The Nasdaq Stock Market as a result of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    We are subject to extensive regulation that may harm our ability to compete with less regulated entities.    Under current U.S. federal securities laws, changes in our rules and operations, including our pricing structure, must be reviewed, and in many cases explicitly approved by the SEC. The SEC may approve,     29    Table of Contents  disapprove, or recommend changes to proposals that we submit. In addition, the SEC may delay the initiation of the public comment process or the approval process. This delay in approving changes, or the altering of any proposed change, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We must compete not only with ECNs that are not subject to the same SEC approval process, but also with other exchanges that have lower regulation and surveillance costs than us. There is a risk that trading will shift to exchanges that charge lower fees because, among other reasons, they spend significantly less on regulation.    In addition, Nasdaq Execution Services, LLC and NASDAQ Options Services, LLC are broker-dealers, which are subject to regulation by the SEC, NASD and other self-regulatory organizations. Any failure to comply with these broker-dealer regulations could have a material effect on the operation of our business, financial condition and operating results.    Our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity, which require that they comply with certain minimum capital requirements. The SEC and NASD impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, dictate the ratio of debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the Uniform Net Capital Rule, NYSE and NASD rules impose certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to, and/or approval of, the SEC, NYSE and NASD for certain withdrawals of capital.    We have self-regulatory organization obligations and also operate a for-profit business, and these two roles may create conflicts of interest.    We have obligations to regulate and monitor activities on The Nasdaq Stock Market and ensure compliance with applicable law and the rules of our market by market participants and Nasdaq-listed companies. The SEC staff has expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest of “for-profit” markets performing the regulatory functions of a self-regulatory organization. While we outsource the majority of our market regulation functions to NASD, we do perform regulatory functions related to our listed companies and our market. In addition, as part of our application for exchange registration, we have agreed that 20% of the directors of our exchange subsidiary will be elected by members of the Exchange rather than the equity holders of the subsidiary. Any failure by us to diligently and fairly regulate the Exchange, to fairly and accurately enforce the rules of the Exchange, to maintain a fair and orderly trading marketplace, to detect and correct aberrant market activity or to otherwise fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation, prompt SEC scrutiny and adversely affect our business and reputation.    Failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to conduct business.    Our future success depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified professional personnel. Competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel, in particular senior officers, is dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. In particular, we are highly dependent on the continued services of Robert Greifeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and other executive officers and key employees who possess extensive financial markets knowledge and technology skills. Other than employment agreements with Mr. Greifeld and our general counsel, we do not have employment agreements with our key executive officers, which would prevent them from leaving and competing with us. We do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our executive officers, managers, key employees or technical personnel. The loss of the services of these persons for any reason, as well as any negative market or industry perception arising from those losses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    30    Table of Contents We are subject to risks relating to litigation and potential securities laws liability.    Many aspects of our business potentially involve substantial liability risks. While we enjoy immunity from private suits for self-regulatory organization activities, we and our broker-dealer affiliates could be exposed to liability under federal and state securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, other federal and state laws and court decisions, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, including insurance laws and regulations. These risks include, among others, potential liability from disputes over the terms of a trade, or claims that a system failure or delay cost a customer money, that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we made materially false or misleading statements or otherwise improper disclosures. As we intend to defend any such litigation actively, significant legal expenses could be incurred. An adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us or our affiliates could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    In addition, we are subject to oversight by the SEC. The SEC regularly examines us and our broker-dealer affiliates for compliance with our obligations under the securities laws. In the case of non-compliance with our obligations under those laws, we or our broker-dealer affiliates could be subject to investigation and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties.    Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our brand-building efforts and ability to compete effectively.    To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, clients, strategic partners and others. The protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. We may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. We have registered, or applied to register, our core trademarks in the United States and in over 50 foreign jurisdictions and have pending U.S. and foreign applications for other trademarks. Effective trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our brand and affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, defending our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.    We are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.    We are a holding company with no material assets other than the equity interests of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, all our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we require dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to meet cash requirements or to pay dividends. If our subsidiaries are unable to pay us dividends and make other payments to us when needed, we will be unable to satisfy our obligations.    Risks Relating to an Investment in Our Common Stock    Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our stockholders.    The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile. Broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuations in our stock price may include, among other things:        •    fluctuations in the value of our investment in LSE;        •    actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;        •    changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our common stock;    31    Table of Contents     •    conditions or trends in our industry, including trading volumes, regulatory changes or changes in the securities marketplace;        •    announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;        •    announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;        •    additions or departures of key personnel; and        •    sales of our common stock, including sales of our common stock by our directors and officers, significant stockholders or our strategic investors.    The market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets.    Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, our equity securities. As of December 31, 2006, there were 112,317,987 shares of our common stock outstanding. All of our common stock is freely transferable, except shares held by our “affiliates,” as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.    The number of freely transferable shares of our common stock will increase upon any exercise of outstanding options pursuant to our stock compensation and stock award plan for our employees. There were 4,411,409 options exercisable as of December 31, 2006 at a weighted average exercise price of $8.71. The number of our shares of our common stock outstanding will also increase upon any conversion of our convertible notes primarily held by Silver Lake Partners, or SLP, and Hellman & Friedman, or H&F, or their respective affiliates, which are currently convertible at a conversion price of $14.50 per share into approximately 30,689,655 shares of our common stock, or any exercise of warrants primarily held by SLP and H&F or their respective affiliates, which are exercisable at a price of $14.50 per share into approximately 5.0 million shares of our common stock. We have granted SLP and H&F and their affiliates demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to the convertible notes and the shares of our common stock underlying those notes and warrants. All shares or notes sold under a registration statement will be freely transferable.    Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and approved exchange rules, including provisions included to address SEC concerns, and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of us and entrench current management.    Our organizational documents place restrictions on the voting rights of certain stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation limits the voting rights of persons (either alone or with related parties) owning more than 5% of the then outstanding votes entitled to be cast on any matter, other than any other person as may be approved by our board of directors prior to the time such person owns more than 5% of the then outstanding votes entitled to be cast on any matter. The SEC has proposed rules that will impose voting and ownership limitations on broker-dealers of 20%, but not require other voting or ownership limitations. We have not determined at this time if we will seek to raise our 5% voting limitation if the SEC adopts the proposed rule. Any change to the 5% voting limitation would require SEC approval.    In response to the SEC’s concern about a concentration of our ownership, our exchange rules include a rule prohibiting any Nasdaq member or any person associated with a Nasdaq member beneficially owning more than 20% of our outstanding voting interests. SEC consent would be required before any investor could obtain more than a 20% voting interest in us. Our exchange rules also require the SEC’s approval of any business ventures with one of our members, subject to exceptions.    In addition, our organizational documents contain provisions that may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us, such as a tender offer or takeover proposal that     32    Table of Contents  might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock. Additionally, certain of these provisions make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in entrenchment of current management.    In addition, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws:        •    require supermajority stockholder approval to remove directors;        •    do not permit stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;        •    require certain advance notice for director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;        •    require supermajority stockholder approval with respect to certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by-laws (including in respect of the provisions set forth above); and        •    authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, or “blank check” preferred stock, that could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval.    Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more (or, in some cases, a holder who previously held 15% or more) of our common stock. In general, Delaware law prohibits a publicly held corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for three years after the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless the corporation’s board of directors and stockholders approve the business combination in a prescribed manner.
