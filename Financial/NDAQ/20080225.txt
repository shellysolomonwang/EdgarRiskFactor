Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.      Table of Contents Forward-Looking Statements    The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains these types of statements. Words such as “anticipates,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes” and words or terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These include, among others, statements relating to:        •    2008 outlook;         •    the scope, nature or impact of acquisitions, dispositions, investments or other transactional activities;         •    the effective dates for and expected benefits of ongoing initiatives; and         •    the outcome of any litigation and/or government investigation to which we are a party and other contingencies.     Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:        •    our operating results may be lower than expected;        •    our ability to consummate or implement or realize synergies from our strategic initiatives and any consequences from our pursuit of our corporate strategy, including the proposed business combination with OMX AB, the transactions with Borse Dubai Limited and the Dubai International Financial Exchange and the proposed acquisitions of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the Boston Stock Exchange;        •    loss of significant trading volume or listed companies;         •    covenants in the indenture governing our notes, and our other existing and proposed debt documents, that may restrict our business;        •    economic, political and market conditions and fluctuations, including interest rate risk, inherent in U.S. and international operations;         •    government and industry regulation; and        •    adverse changes that may occur in the securities markets generally.    Most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond our control. You should consider the uncertainty and any risk related to forward-looking statements that we make. These risk factors are more fully described under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” in this Form 10-K. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. You should carefully read this entire Form 10-K, including “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Except as required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events. For any forward-looking statements contained in any document, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.    Table of Contents  Part I     Item 1. Business.    Nasdaq Overview     The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. is a holding company that operates The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC as its wholly-owned subsidiary. Nasdaq became a holding company on August 1, 2006 when The Nasdaq Stock Market commenced operations as a registered national securities exchange for Nasdaq-listed securities.    We, through our subsidiaries, are a leading provider of securities listing, trading, and information products and services. Our revenue sources are diverse and include revenues from transaction services, market data products and services, listing fees, insurance products, shareholder, directors and newswire services and financial products.    The Nasdaq Stock Market is the largest equity securities market in the United States, both in terms of number of listed companies and traded share volume. As of December 31, 2007, The Nasdaq Stock Market was home to 3,135 listed companies with a combined market capitalization of over $4.2 trillion. Transactions involving 757.1 billion equity securities were executed on or reported to our systems in 2007, 30.3% higher than in 2006.    We manage, operate and provide our services in two business segments, our Market Services segment and Issuer Services segment.    Market Services. Our Market Services segment includes our transaction-based business and our market information services business. The Nasdaq Stock Market operates The Nasdaq Market Center, our transaction-based platform, which provides our market participants with the ability to access, process, display and integrate orders and quotes in The Nasdaq Stock Market and other national securities exchanges in the U.S. enabling our customers to execute trades in over 7,400 equity securities (including ETFs) during 2007. The Nasdaq Market Center allows us to route and execute buy and sell orders as well as report transactions for Nasdaq-listed securities and those securities listed on other national securities exchanges, providing fee-based revenues. We also generate revenues by providing varying levels of quote and trade information to market participants and data vendors, who in turn sell subscriptions for this information to the public. Our systems enable vendors to gain direct access to our detailed order data, index information, mutual fund pricing information, and corporate action information on Nasdaq-listed securities.    Issuer Services. Our Issuer Services segment includes our securities listings business, insurance business, shareholder, directors and newswire services and our financial products business. The companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market represent a diverse array of industries including information technology, financial services, healthcare, consumer products and industrials. In the financial products business, we develop and license financial products and associated derivatives based on Nasdaq indexes. We have also introduced financial products based on other Nasdaq indexes, including the Nasdaq-100 Index, the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index. In addition, we generate revenues by licensing and listing third-party structured products and third-party sponsored ETFs. We also provide, through our subsidiaries, products and services to our listed companies and other customers, including insurance, shareholder, directors and newswire services.    Recent Developments    Combination with OMX AB and Transactions with Borse Dubai. On September 20, 2007, Nasdaq, Borse Dubai and OMX entered into definitive documents related to various transactions, or collectively, the Transactions. Pursuant to the Transactions, Borse Dubai conducted an offer for all of the outstanding shares of OMX. Borse Dubai’s initial offer expired on February 12, 2008 and it announced that 97.6% of the outstanding shares of OMX have been tendered. Under the terms of the agreement, Borse Dubai has agreed to sell the OMX     1    Table of Contents  shares acquired in the offer or otherwise owned by Borse Dubai or its subsidiaries to us in exchange for up to SEK 12.6 billion in cash (which amount will be decreased by SEK 265 for every OMX share not acquired by Borse Dubai) and 60.6 million shares of Nasdaq common stock. At the close of the Transactions, Borse Dubai will directly hold approximately 42.7 million shares of Nasdaq common stock (representing 19.99% of our fully diluted outstanding share capital) and approximately 18.0 million shares will be held in a trust, or the Trust, for Borse Dubai’s economic benefit until disposed of by the Trust.    In addition, as part of the Transactions, we, Borse Dubai and the Dubai International Financial Exchange, or DIFX, have entered into an agreement which provides that in exchange for $50 million in cash to DIFX and the entry into certain technology and trademark licensing agreements, we will acquire 33 1/3% of the equity of DIFX. We will also be responsible for 50% of any additional capital contribution calls made by DIFX, subject to a maximum aggregate additional commitment by Nasdaq of up to $25 million. Closing of this transaction is conditioned upon the concurrent closing of the combination with OMX.    We expect the Transactions and the DIFX investment to close by the end of February 2008.    Proposed Acquisitions of the Boston Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. On October 1, 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Boston Stock Exchange, or BSX, for $61.0 million in cash. The BSX acquisition will provide us with an additional license for trading both equities and options and a clearing license. After the close of the BSX acquisition, we expect that BSX’s current operations will be discontinued and will not be integrated into our current operations. We expect the acquisition of BSX to close in the first half of 2008.    On November 7, 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, or PHLX, for $652.0 million in cash, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. The acquisition of PHLX, the third largest options market in the U.S., will significantly diversify our product portfolio by providing us with a premier options trading platform in the U.S. We expect the acquisition of PHLX to close in the first half of 2008.    Sale of LSE Investment. In 2006, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Nightingale Acquisition Limited, or NAL, acquired an investment in the London Stock Exchange Group plc, or the LSE, at that time totaling approximately 28.8% of the issued ordinary share capital of the LSE. On September 25, 2007, we sold 28.0% of LSE’s share capital to Borse Dubai for approximately $1.6 billion in cash. On September 26, 2007, through open market transactions, we sold the remaining substantial balance of our holdings in the LSE for $193.5 million in cash. We used approximately $1.1 billion of the approximately $1.8 billion in total proceeds from the sale of the LSE shares to repay in full and terminate our then-outstanding credit facilities.    Nasdaq History and Structure    We were founded in 1971 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of FINRA, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (then known as National Association of Securities Dealers, or NASD), which operates subject to the oversight of the SEC. Beginning in 2000, FINRA restructured and broadened our ownership through a two-phase private placement of our securities. Securities in the private placements were offered to all FINRA members, as well as some investment companies and issuers listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market.    In connection with the restructuring, on November 9, 2000, we applied to the SEC for registration as a national securities exchange. Prior to operating as an exchange, The Nasdaq Stock Market operated under a Delegation Plan approved by the SEC that provided a delegation of legal authority from FINRA to us to operate as a stock market. Although we exercised primary responsibility for market-related functions, including market-related rulemaking and interpretations, all actions taken pursuant to authority by FINRA were subject to review, ratification or rejection by the FINRA board of directors.    2    Table of Contents The SEC approved our application to register as a national securities exchange on January 13, 2006, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions. Upon fulfilling these conditions, The Nasdaq Stock Market began operating as a registered national securities exchange for Nasdaq-listed securities in August 2006 and as an exchange for non-Nasdaq-listed securities in February 2007. To facilitate our operation as a national securities exchange, we also formed The FINRA/Nasdaq Trade Reporting Facility LLC, or FINRA/Nasdaq TRF, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Through the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF we continue to collect reports of trades executed by broker-dealers outside of our exchange. FINRA regulates the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF as one of its facilities. The FINRA/Nasdaq TRF began operating in August 2006 for Nasdaq-listed securities and in March 2007 for non-Nasdaq-listed securities.    On December 20, 2006, we ceased to be a subsidiary of FINRA. FINRA maintained voting control over us through its ownership of the one outstanding share of our Series D preferred stock and FINRA consolidated our financial position and results of operations in its consolidated financial statements. In connection with the process of The Nasdaq Stock Market becoming a registered national securities exchange, Nasdaq was removed as a party to the Delegation Plan and we redeemed FINRA’s share of Series D preferred stock. FINRA achieved full divestiture of ownership of our common stock with the sale of its remaining shares of our common stock in July 2006.    In August 2006, we adopted a holding company structure in connection with our registration as a national securities exchange. Our subsidiary, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, holds the operations of the exchange and our exchange license. In November 2006, we completed an internal reorganization that resulted in the transfer of ownership of some of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, to our exchange subsidiary.    With exchange registration, Nasdaq received its own status as a self-regulatory organization, or SRO, through Nasdaq’s exchange subsidiary separate from that of FINRA. Pursuant to securities laws, an SRO is responsible for regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules and regulations governing the business conduct of its members. As an SRO, The Nasdaq Stock Market has its own rules pertaining to its members and listed companies regarding listing, membership and trading that are distinct and separate from those rules applicable to broker-dealers that are administered by FINRA. Broker-dealers may choose to become members of The Nasdaq Stock Market, in addition to their memberships with other SROs, including FINRA. See “—Nasdaq Regulation.” FINRA continues to provide regulatory services to us. See “—Nasdaq Regulation—Regulatory Services Agreement.”   Nasdaq Products and Services    We operate in two segments: Market Services and Issuer Services. Financial information about segments and geographic areas may be found in Note 20, “Segments,” to our consolidated financial statements.    Market Services. Our Market Services segment includes our transaction-based business and our market information services business. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Market Services revenues were $2,152.4 million, which represented 88.3% of Nasdaq’s total revenues. Market Services revenues less liquidity rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees were $528.1 million, which represented 65.0% of total revenues less liquidity rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements.    Trade execution services. The Nasdaq Market Center is our transaction-based platform that provides market participants with the ability to access, process, display and integrate orders and quotes in The Nasdaq Stock Market. Market participants include market makers, broker-dealers operating as electronic communication networks, or ECNs, registered securities exchanges and other broker-dealers. We provide these services for Nasdaq-listed and non-Nasdaq-listed securities. Specifically, The Nasdaq Market Center:        •    Provides a comprehensive display of the interest by our market participants at the highest price a participant is willing to buy a security (best bid) and also the lowest price a participant is willing to sell that security (best offer).    3    Table of Contents     •    Provides subscribers quotes, orders and total anonymous interest at every price level in The Nasdaq Market Center for exchange-listed securities and critical data for the Nasdaq Crossing Network, including the Opening, Closing, Halt, IPO, Intraday and Post-Close Crosses.        •    Provides anonymity to market participants, i.e., participants do not know the identity of the firm displaying the order unless that firm chooses to reveal its identity, which can contribute to improved pricing for securities by reducing the potential market impact that transactions by investors whose trading activity, if known, may influence others.    Our execution services generate revenues from:        •    Transaction execution charges, which are charges assessed on a per share basis to the party that accesses the liquidity provided by another market participant. In most circumstances, we credit a portion of the per share execution charge as a rebate (presented as cost of revenues) to the market participant that provides the liquidity (liquidity is the number and range of buy and sell orders available to our market participants). These charges represent our primary fee for execution services.        •    Our share of tape fees for the trading of securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, and the American Stock Exchange, or Amex.    Also, we pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Section 31 fees. These fees are recorded as execution and trade reporting revenues with a corresponding amount recorded as cost of revenues. The Section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. We collect the fees as a pass-through charge from organizations executing eligible trades on The Nasdaq Stock Market and recognize these amounts in cost of revenues when invoiced. Section 31 fees received are included in cash and cash equivalents at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as Section 31 fees payable to the SEC until paid. Since the amount recorded in revenues is equal to the amount recorded in cost of revenues, there is no impact on our revenues less liquidity rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees.    To enhance market transparency, we introduced the Opening Cross and Closing Cross in 2004 and the Halt Cross and IPO Cross in 2006. The Opening Cross is a process for pre-market open trading and price discovery consisting of a centralized order facility that provides market participants and investors with a highly transparent and accurate opening price in securities listed on an exchange. Similarly, the Closing Cross is a centralized order facility that provides an orderly market close for securities listed on an exchange. The IPO Cross is designed to provide executions utilizing a fair and transparent process to begin secondary trading of initial public offerings based on supply and demand. The Halt Cross is designed to provide executions utilizing a fair and transparent process when we resume trading in market halted securities. A new pegged order type that allows the price of an order to be pegged to the mid-point of the National Best Bid and Offer, or NBBO, was introduced in January 2007.    We also introduced the Intraday and Post-Close Crosses, part of a new fully-anonymous trade execution facility designed to promote the execution of large trades, in July 2007. The Intraday and Post-Close Crosses provide market participants and investors with a highly efficient and accurate single price at specific times during the trading day, resulting in the discovery of larger pools of liquidity while minimizing market impact and associated price movements.    In the first quarter of 2007, we completed our integration of The Nasdaq Market Center and the Brut and INET execution systems into a single trading platform. Nasdaq’s system integration, which is based on the INET platform, provides improved execution quality and speed, while maintaining the attributes of The Nasdaq Market Center, including market making functionality, attributed quotes, and the Nasdaq Crossing Network. Our system integration in Nasdaq-listed securities was completed in the fourth quarter of 2006 and the system integration in non-Nasdaq-listed securities was completed in February 2007.    4    Table of Contents We currently provide connectivity and order routing to options exchanges. In the first half of 2008, subject to SEC approval, we expect to launch The NASDAQ Options Market, a new options trading platform. The trading platform will be designed to leverage our existing technology, which we acquired through the INET acquisition. In addition, the trading platform exchange will leverage our current customer connectivity and market structure. We are designing the trading platform to handle the options market transition from nickel and dime quoting increments to penny quoting increments.    Trade reporting services. All registered national securities exchanges and securities associations are required to establish a transaction reporting plan for the central collection of price and volume information concerning trades executed in those markets. We provide three primary revenue-generating reporting services:        •    Trade reporting. Trades executed on The Nasdaq Stock Market are automatically reported by us under the appropriate transaction reporting plan. Currently, we do not charge market participants for reporting most of these trades. We do, however, earn revenues for all of these trades in the form of shared market information revenues under the Nasdaq Unlisted Trading Privileges Plan, or UTP Plan, for Nasdaq-listed securities, under the Consolidated Tape Plan, or CTA Plan, for NYSE-listed securities and the Consolidated Quotation Plan, or CQ Plan, for Amex- and regional exchange-listed securities. In addition, the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF collects trade reports as a facility of FINRA. A large percentage of these trades result from orders that broker-dealers have matched internally, or internalized, and are submitted to the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF for reporting purposes only. The FINRA/Nasdaq TRF does not charge market participants for locked in reporting of most trades, but it does earn shared market information revenues with respect to the trades.        •    Trade comparison. The FINRA/Nasdaq TRF also generates revenues by providing trade comparison to broker-dealers by matching and locking-in the two parties to a trade that they have submitted to the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF for reporting and clearing.        •    Risk management. We provide clearing firms with risk management services to assist them in monitoring their exposure to their correspondent brokers.    Access services to our trading platform. We provide our market participants with several alternatives for accessing The Nasdaq Market Center for a fee. By shifting connectivity to The Nasdaq Market Center from proprietary networks to third-party networks, we have significantly reduced our technology and network costs and increased our systems’ scalability without affecting performance or reliability.    The Nasdaq Market Center may be accessed using our Financial Information Exchange, or FIX, product that uses the FIX protocol, a standard method of financial communication between trading firms and vendors. This product enables firms to leverage their existing FIX technology with cost-effective connections to The Nasdaq Market Center. We also have developed QIX, a proprietary programming interface that provides a more streamlined and efficient protocol for our users with expanded functionality, including quotation updates. Market participants may also access The Nasdaq Market Center using Computer-to-Computer interface, another protocol, which allows market participants to enter transactions directly from their computer systems to our computer systems. Finally, firms may use former INET protocols to access our single trading platform. As an alternative to a firm-developed trading front-end, Nasdaq provides the New Nasdaq Workstation, an internet browser based interface that allows market participants to view market data and enter orders, quotes and trade reports.    We also provide co-location services to our market participants whereby firms may lease space for equipment within our data center. We charge these participants fees for cabinet space, connectivity and support.    Market information. We collect and provide varying levels of analytical, quote and trade information to market participants and data vendors, who in turn sell subscriptions for this information to the public as part of our Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions business. We collect information, distribute it and earn revenues as a member of the UTP Plan and as a distributor of our proprietary market data.    5    Table of Contents We operate as the exclusive Securities Information Processor as part of the UTP Plan for the collection and dissemination of the best bid and offer information and last transaction information from the exchanges and markets that quote and trade in Nasdaq-listed securities. We also are a participant in the UTP Plan and share in the net distribution of revenue according to the plan on the same terms as the other plan participants. In our role as the Securities Information Processor, we collect and disseminate quotation and last sale information for all transactions in Nasdaq-listed securities whether on The Nasdaq Stock Market or other exchanges. We sell this information to data vendors, which the data vendors then sell to the public. After deducting costs associated with acting as an exclusive Securities Information Processor, we distribute the tape fees to the respective UTP Plan participants, including us, based on a combination of the participants’ respective trading share and quoting share as determined by the Regulation NMS formula. In addition, all Nasdaq Market Center trades in exchange-listed securities are reported and disseminated in real time, and as such, we share in the tape fees for information on NYSE- and Amex-listed securities.    Interested parties also can receive real-time quote and trade information beyond the best bid and offer quotes through a number of proprietary products that we offer. We use our broad distribution network of market data vendors and market participants (1,475 as of December 31, 2007) to deliver data regarding our market depth, index values, mutual fund valuation, order imbalances, market sentiment and other analytical data. We offer a range of proprietary data products, including TotalView, our flagship market depth quote product. TotalView shows subscribers quotes, orders and total anonymous interest at every price level in The Nasdaq Market Center for Nasdaq-listed securities and critical data for the Nasdaq Crossing Network.    TotalView is offered through distributors to professional subscribers for a monthly fee per terminal and to non-professional subscribers for a lower monthly fee per terminal. We also offer a TotalView Enterprise License to facilitate broad based distribution of this data to large audiences. During 2007, our TotalView professional subscribers increased by over 34% (excluding non-paying internal users and users via the Nasdaq Workstation product). In addition, we charge the distributor a monthly distributor fee.    We operate several other proprietary services and data products to provide market information, which include:        •    Nasdaq DataStore, one aspect of Nasdaq’s initiative to use plug-and-play technology to deliver new proprietary information content. NASDAQ Pre, the Nasdaq Daily Share Volume Report, and Nasdaq Pathfinders were new products introduced in beta form in 2007 via the Nasdaq DataStore;        •    Nasdaq Market Analytix, a suite of data products including Nasdaq Market Forces and Nasdaq Velocity designed to provide market insights based on calculations performed on the data that is provided to Nasdaq’s execution services;        •    ModelView, a product designed to provide greater insight into the patterns of liquidity in The Nasdaq Market Center;        •    OpenView, a product providing complete depth-of-book liquidity for The Nasdaq Market Center in NYSE- and Amex-listed securities;        •    Mutual Fund Quotation Service, a listing service for over 25,000 mutual funds, money market funds and unit investment trusts that supports fund data, including net asset values, and capital gains and dividend income distribution and provides print and electronic media exposure for the funds;        •    Mutual Fund Dissemination Service, a service that facilitates the real-time and end-of-day recap dissemination of all mutual fund pricing information and is used by data vendors and media to receive complete net asset value data on funds listed with us;        •    Nasdaq Index Dissemination Service, a real-time data feed that carries the values for a number of broad-based and sector indexes and ETFs;        •    Nasdaq.com, a leading financial website for the investor community that generates revenues from advertising and product sales; and    6    Table of Contents     •    NasdaqTrader.com, a financial website that provides broker-dealers and market data vendors with information and data regarding our corporate initiatives (such as the Nasdaq Crossing Network) and other products and services for a monthly subscription fee.    Issuer Services. Our Issuer Services segment includes our securities listings business, insurance business, shareholder, directors and newswire services and our financial products business. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Issuer Services accounted for revenues of $283.9 million, which represented 11.7% of our total revenues and 35.0% of our total revenues less liquidity rebates, brokerage clearance and exchange fees. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements.    Securities listings business. We have operated our securities listings business as the Corporate Client Group, which provides customer support services and products to Nasdaq-listed companies and is responsible for obtaining new listings on The Nasdaq Stock Market. More companies list on The Nasdaq Stock Market than any other U.S. market.    We aggressively pursue new listings from companies undergoing IPOs. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we attracted 62% of the IPOs eligible for listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market and 36% of the IPOs eligible for listing on the NYSE.                        Year ended December 31,         2007       2006       2005      Initial public offerings listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market     132       137       126     Percentage of initial public offerings on primary U.S. markets     62 %     67 %     59 %   Capital raised by initial public offerings listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market (in billions)   $ 16.8     $ 17.4     $ 12.3      Companies seeking to list securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market must meet minimum listing requirements, including specified financial and corporate governance criteria. Once listed, companies must meet continued listing standards. The Nasdaq Stock Market currently has three tiers of listed companies: The Nasdaq Global Select Market, The Nasdaq Global Market and The Nasdaq Capital Market. Our top listing tier, The Nasdaq Global Select Market, has the highest initial listing standards in the world. All three market tiers maintain rigorous listing and corporate governance standards and issuers listing on these markets have the opportunity to leverage an array of Nasdaq corporate services.    As of December 31, 2007, a total of 1,156 companies listed securities on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, 1,478 companies listed securities on The Nasdaq Global Market and 501 companies listed securities on The Nasdaq Capital Market. During 2007, 290 new companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, with 36 listings on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, 183 on The Nasdaq Global Market and 71 on The Nasdaq Capital Market. During 2006, 285 new companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, with 19 listings on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, 216 on The Nasdaq Global Market and 50 on The Nasdaq Capital Market.    In 2007, a total of 32 companies switched their listing to The Nasdaq Stock Market from the NYSE or Amex. In 2006, a total of 30 companies switched from Amex, and Liberty Media Corporation, Innospec Inc., Computer Task Group, Inc. and E*TRADE Financial switched from the NYSE.    Notable listings in 2007 included the IPOs of National CineMedia, Inc., MerueloMaddux Properties and Clearwire Corporation and the switches from NYSE of DirecTV, and from Amex of Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc., National Beverage Corp. and PowerSecure International. Nasdaq also saw several notable industrial listings, including the IPOs of Orion Energy Systems, Inc. and Greek shipping company Paragon Shipping Inc. and the Amex switch of Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc.    7    Table of Contents We also have attracted listings from foreign companies seeking to access U.S. capital markets. Notable non-U.S. new listings in 2007 included the switch of Star Bulk Carriers Corp. from the Amex and the IPOs of MercadoLibre, Inc. from Argentina, lululemon athletica from Canada, VisionChina Media Inc. from China, and Castlepoint Holdings Ltd. from Bermuda. We had a total of 309 foreign companies listed on our markets at December 31, 2007 and 323 at December 31, 2006.    Since 2004, we have permitted NYSE-listed issuers to dually list their stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market. As of December 31, 2007, securities of 11 companies were dual listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market and NYSE. We continue to target companies about joining the dual-listing program.    Each year some companies cease listing with us for several reasons. In 2007, 348 companies ceased listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Companies cease listing for the following reasons: failing to meet our listing standards (approximately 14% of delistings in 2007), merger and acquisition activity (approximately 64%) and, to a lesser extent, for other reasons such as switching to another listing venue (approximately 22%). During 2007, the 348 delistings were offset by 132 IPOs and 158 other added listings. There were 285 added listings and 303 delistings in 2006.    We charge issuers an initial listing fee, a listing of additional shares fee and an annual fee. The initial listing fee for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market includes a listing application fee and a total shares outstanding fee. The fee for listing of additional shares is based on the total shares outstanding, which we review quarterly. Annual fees for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market are based on total shares outstanding. Initial listing and listing of additional shares fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods, which are six and four years, respectively, based on our historical listing experience, pursuant to the requirements of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13: Revenue Recognition, or SAB Topic 13.    In February 2007, the SEC approved a new pricing structure for our annual listing fees. This new schedule generally increased the annual and listing of additional shares fees listed companies pay to us, as well as the initial listing fee to list on The Nasdaq Capital Market.    After the initial listing, our Corporate Client Group provides customer support services, products and programs to Nasdaq-listed companies. To offer additional services to our listed companies, in 2005 we acquired Carpenter Moore and the remaining 50% interest in the Nasdaq Insurance Agency, LLC, independent insurance brokerage firms. In 2006, we acquired Shareholder.com, a firm specializing in shareholder communications and investor relations intelligence services and PrimeNewswire, a firm specializing in press release newswire and multimedia services. In 2007, we acquired Directors Desk LLC, a firm providing technology to board members of public and private companies in the United States and abroad.    Financial products business. We develop and license Nasdaq-branded indexes, associated derivatives and financial products as part of Nasdaq Financial Products. We believe that these indexes and products leverage, extend and enhance the Nasdaq brand. License fees for our trademark licenses vary by product based on assets or number or underlying dollar value of contracts issued. In addition to generating licensing revenues for Nasdaq, these products, particularly mutual funds and ETFs, lead to increased investments in companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, which enhances our ability to attract new listings.    Our flagship index, the Nasdaq-100 Index, includes the top 100 non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Nasdaq indexes are the basis for over 600 financial products in 36 countries. Nasdaq also licenses cash-settled options, futures and options on futures on its indexes.    Nasdaq Financial Products, through its PORTAL Market, facilitates the eligibility for clearing and settlement services at The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, or DTCC, of PORTAL/Rule 144A securities. In 2007 and in 2006, we continued to facilitate the processing service for Rule 144A eligible securities through PORTAL with over 2,400 and 2,700 applications processed, respectively. In August 2007, we launched     8    Table of Contents  our PORTAL Trading System, a system allowing for online trading of equity securities pursuant to Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933. The PORTAL Market id designed to be a comprehensive offering including capital formation, trading, data and financial products.    On November 12, 2007, we and a group of leading securities firms announced our intention to form The PORTAL Alliance, an industry standard facility designated to serve the market for 144A equity securities. The PORTAL Alliance will work with third-party service providers to create an open, industry-standard facility for the private offering, trading, shareholder tracking and settlement of unregistered equity securities sold to qualified institutional buyers.    Fee Changes    We may change the pricing of our products and services in response to competitive pressures or changes in market or general economic conditions. Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, Nasdaq must file all proposals for a change in its pricing structure with the SEC. We provide updated information on the pricing of our products and services on our website at www.nasdaqtrader.com. See also “—Competition” and “Risk Factors—The securities market business is highly competitive.”    Technology    Over the past six years, we have reduced our technology costs, consistent with our regulatory obligations, by migrating to fewer, less expensive technology platforms, introducing less expensive network solutions, and by reducing our workforce. Our transaction speed throughput and system reliability has been enhanced by our migration to the INET platform.    The Nasdaq Market Center systems are located in a processing complex in our Northeast Data Center. The systems have handled trade volume of over six billion shares daily and routinely handle over 250,000 transactions per second and are designed to maximize transaction reliability and network security across each of the most critical system services that comprise The Nasdaq Stock Market. In addition, our systems have the ability to handle increased capacity. To maximize reliability, we have developed a backup system in the event the primary systems are unable to perform.    Market data from our quote and trade execution systems are transferred via high-speed communications links to a market data repository and are available for real-time analysis, historical analysis, market surveillance and regulation, and data mining. The information is provided to applications and users through relational databases, higher-level access facilities and Internet applications.    Intellectual Property    We own or have licensed rights to trade names, trademarks, domain names and service marks that we use in conjunction with our operations and services. We have registered many of our most important trademarks in the United States and in foreign countries. For example, our primary “NASDAQ” mark is a registered trademark in the United States and in over 50 other countries worldwide. We also maintain copyright protection in our Nasdaq-branded materials and pursue patent protection for Nasdaq-developed inventions and processes. We currently have 11 issued United States patents and approximately 58 pending applications, some of which also are filed in foreign jurisdictions.    Nasdaq Acquisition Strategy    We have grown our business through acquisitions since 2004. Our strategy for acquisitions is to identify and acquire only those elements that are most important to our success. We integrated the key components of the Brut technology and the Brut team into Nasdaq in 2005 and completed the integration of INET and the migration     9    Table of Contents  of its customers to the INET platform in 2007. Consistent with this focused approach, we acquired Carpenter Moore, Shareholder.com, PrimeNewswire and Directors Desk to meet the specific needs of listed companies and other customers. In 2007, we entered into definitive agreements to combine with OMX and to acquire the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the Boston Stock Exchange.    Nasdaq Regulation    Federal securities laws establish a two-tiered system for the regulation of securities markets, market participants and listed companies. The SEC occupies the first tier and has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws. SROs, which are non-governmental organizations, occupy the second tier. The Nasdaq Stock Market is an SRO. SROs, such as national securities exchanges, are registered with the SEC and are subject to the SEC’s extensive regulation and oversight.    This regulatory framework applies to our business in the following ways:        •    regulation of The Nasdaq Stock Market; and        •    regulation of our broker-dealer subsidiaries.    The rules and regulations that apply to our business are focused primarily on safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and of market participants and investors generally. While we believe that regulation improves the quality of The Nasdaq Stock Market and, therefore, our company, these rules and regulations are not focused on the protection of our stockholders. Federal securities laws and the rules that govern our operations are subject to frequent change. Any subsequent change in law or regulation, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and operating results.    Regulation of The Nasdaq Stock Market. With exchange registration, we received our own SRO status through our exchange subsidiary, separate from that of FINRA. As an SRO, we have our own rules pertaining to our members and listed companies regarding listing, membership and trading that are distinct and separate from those rules applicable to broker-dealers that are administered by FINRA. Broker-dealers may choose to become members of The Nasdaq Stock Market, in addition to their other SRO memberships, including membership in FINRA.    As the operator of a national securities exchange, virtually all facets of our operations are subject to the SEC’s oversight, as prescribed by the Exchange Act, and we are subject to periodic and special examinations by the SEC. We also are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the SEC or other interested parties at any time in connection with alleged regulatory violations. We have been subject to a number of routine reviews and inspections by the SEC. To the extent such actions or reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes, we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business, which may adversely affect our business. We are also subject to Section 17 of the Exchange Act, which imposes record-keeping requirements, including the requirement to make certain records available to the SEC for examination.    SROs in the securities industry are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors. The Exchange Act and the rules thereunder impose on the SROs many regulatory and operational responsibilities, including the day-to-day responsibilities for market and broker-dealer oversight. In general, an SRO is responsible for regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules and regulations governing the business conduct of its members.    Section 19 of the Exchange Act provides that we must submit proposed changes to any of the SRO rules, practices and procedures, including revisions to provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws that constitute SRO rules, to the SEC. The SEC will typically publish the proposal for public comment, following which the SEC may approve or disapprove the proposal, as it deems appropriate. The SEC’s action is designed to     10    Table of Contents  ensure that applicable SRO rules and procedures are consistent with the aims of the Exchange Act and its rules and regulations. If the SEC disapproves a proposal that we have submitted, it could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act, we must file all proposals for a change in our pricing structure with the SEC.    We sought to preserve a regulatory separation upon operation as a national securities exchange. FINRA provides regulatory services to The Nasdaq Stock Market, including the regulation of trading activity on the exchange and surveillance and investigative functions. We have a limited direct regulatory role in conducting real-time market monitoring through our MarketWatch department. This department, among other things, monitors for trades whose prices are away from the current market and initiates trading halts as necessary. Suspicious trading behavior discovered by MarketWatch staff and all other Nasdaq employees is referred to FINRA for further investigation. FINRA performs the surveillance and investigative functions for Nasdaq. We have preserved this regulatory separation now that we are operational as a national securities exchange.    We have additional regulatory functions related to companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market that are handled by our Listing Qualifications department. This department is responsible for maintaining a compliance-monitoring and enforcement program with respect to our requirements for initial and continued listing. Companies that wish to list on The Nasdaq Stock Market are required to satisfy a variety of quantitative and qualitative requirements to become listed and to continue to be listed, including all our corporate governance listing standards. Companies that fail to maintain compliance with these requirements are subject to delisting. To provide regulatory transparency and assist issuers in maintaining compliance, our Listing Qualifications department provides written interpretations with respect to the application of our listing requirements and maintains a website providing interpretive guidance.    When we transferred our own listing from the OTC Bulletin Board, or OTCBB, to the Nasdaq National Market in 2005, the SEC approved special listing standards with respect to listing our common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market. These listing standards require periodic reporting of compliance to the SEC and an annual compliance audit by an independent accounting firm. Our failure to maintain compliance with these listing standards could result in our common stock being delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market.    Regulatory Services Agreement. FINRA provides us with regulatory services, including the regulation of trading activity on The Nasdaq Stock Market and the surveillance and investigative functions of The Nasdaq Stock Market, pursuant to a regulatory services agreement and a transitional regulatory agreement discussed below. The regulatory services agreement became effective for Nasdaq-listed securities in August 2006 and for non-Nasdaq-listed securities in March 2007. Prior to the effectiveness of the regulatory services agreement, FINRA provided regulatory services to us pursuant to the Delegation Plan. We paid FINRA $28.9 million in 2007, $33.8 million in 2006 and $41.8 million in 2005 for regulatory services.    Under the regulatory services agreement, FINRA will provide regulatory services to us for 10 years commencing August 1, 2006. The services are of the same type and scope as were provided by FINRA to us under the Delegation Plan. Each regulatory service is to be provided for a minimum of five years, then the parties may determine to terminate a particular service. The termination of a particular service will generally be based upon a review of pricing and the need for such services. Under the agreement, FINRA bills us a fee for each required service provided that it is based on FINRA’s direct and indirect costs plus a markup of six percent on compensation costs related to FINRA’s employees used to provide the services. Any services other than those required by the agreement are billed at cost, plus a mutually agreed upon markup.    Under the regulatory services agreement, FINRA:        •    reviews and approves new member applications;        •    performs automated surveillance of trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market;    11    Table of Contents     •    reviews member firm compliance with the rules and regulations applicable to trading and market-making functions in The Nasdaq Stock Market;        •    investigates suspicious activity in quoting and trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market;        •    conducts examinations of member firms;        •    initiates the disciplinary process once it is determined that a potential violation of a federal securities law or rule, or an SRO rule, may have occurred; and        •    operates an arbitration program and a mediation program for the resolution of customer, member firm employee, and Nasdaq member-to-member disputes.    Broker-Dealer Regulation. Nasdaq’s broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the SEC, the SROs and the various state securities regulators. We acquired three broker-dealers, Brut, LLC, INET ATS, Inc. and Island Execution Services, LLC, in connection with recent acquisitions. In February 2006, INET ATS, Inc., the entity which operated the INET ECN, was merged into Brut, LLC, with Brut, LLC as the surviving entity. Subsequently, Brut, LLC was renamed Nasdaq Execution Services, LLC. Nasdaq Execution Services currently operates as our routing broker for sending orders from The Nasdaq Market Center to other venues for execution. In 2006, Island Execution Services, LLC was renamed NASDAQ Options Services, LLC. NASDAQ Options Services is expected to serve as the options routing broker-dealer for Nasdaq’s new options market when it is launched.    Nasdaq Execution Services is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. It is also a member of the NYSE, FINRA, Amex, BSX, Chicago Stock Exchange, International Securities Exchange, Pacific Stock Exchange, PHLX, The Nasdaq Stock Market, Chicago Board Options Exchange and National Stock Exchange. NASDAQ Options Services is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. It is also a member of FINRA, the Amex, BSX, International Securities Exchange, Pacific Stock Exchange, PHLX and The Nasdaq Stock Market.    The SEC, NYSE and FINRA adopt rules and examine broker-dealers and require strict compliance with their rules and regulations. The SEC, SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings which can result in censures, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or employees. The SEC and state regulators may also institute proceedings against broker-dealers seeking an injunction or other sanction. The SEC and SRO rules cover many aspects of a broker-dealer’s business, including capital structure and withdrawals, sales methods, trade practices among broker-dealers, use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, record-keeping, the financing of customers’ purchases, broker-dealer and employee registration and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. All broker-dealers have an SRO that is assigned by the SEC as the broker-dealer’s designated examining authority, or DEA. The DEA is responsible for examining a broker-dealer for compliance with the SEC’s financial responsibility rules. FINRA is the DEA for both Nasdaq Execution Services and NASDAQ Options Services. A failure to comply with the SEC’s request in a satisfactory manner may have adverse consequences and changing the DEA may entail additional regulatory costs.    As registered broker-dealer subsidiaries, Nasdaq Execution Services and NASDAQ Options Services are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity, which requires that they comply with certain minimum capital requirements. The SEC and FINRA impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, dictate the ratio of debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the Uniform Net Capital Rule and FINRA rules impose certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC and FINRA for certain withdrawals of capital.    As of December 31, 2007, Nasdaq Execution Services was required to maintain minimum net capital of $0.3 million and had total net capital of approximately $18.9 million, or $18.6 million in excess of the minimum     12    Table of Contents  amount required. As of December 31, 2007, NASDAQ Options Services was required to maintain minimum net capital of $0.3 million and had total net capital of approximately $4.7 million, or $4.4 million in excess of the minimum amount required.    Industry    The liberalization and globalization of world financial markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital, greater international participation in local markets, greater trading volumes and more competition among markets in different geographical areas. As a result, the competition among U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based markets and other execution venues has become more intense. The increased globalization of world markets also has increased the need for regulatory cooperation between markets in different jurisdictions.    Industry growth is driven by additional demand for active and transaction-intensive asset management, the shift away from floor-based to electronic trading platforms, significantly enhanced technology, increased participation from retail investors and regulatory changes both in Europe and in the U.S. Globally, investors continue to demand greater efficiency in trading securities, new sophisticated order types, seamless trading across asset classes and markets, and ever better performance of trading platforms, which we expect will continue to fuel growth in volumes, irrespective of the macroeconomic environment.    Recent regulatory changes have been implemented to eliminate trading barriers between exchanges and to increase efficiency for investors. The adoption of Regulation NMS in the U.S. and the current implementation of the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID, aim to promote and ensure market center competition, order interaction and price transparency so that investors may enjoy lower transaction costs and more flexibility to trade financial assets in a number of different locations and methods. The most significant change in the U.S. is that every broker and exchange is obligated to route orders to any market center showing a better price. In Europe, the corresponding effect of MFID is that every broker will be forced to route orders to the market centers with the best execution performance, including price, speed, liquidity and reliability. In both cases, the effect is expected to be increased performance-based competition among market centers.    As a result of these industry trends, an exchange’s scale and technology have become very important factors in maintaining competitive advantages. Scale allows for greater liquidity pools, which is a critical criterion for where investor order flow is directed. In addition, scale provides an exchange with operating leverage by processing a growing number of transactions over an existing technology platform, which we believe improves profitability. Given the recent regulatory changes in the U.S. and Europe, as well as the continued evolution of investor requirements, technology capabilities have become even more important because order flow will be driven to those exchange providers that provide the best execution performance and multi-asset trading capabilities over an integrated platform.    The global cash equity exchange industry    Cash equities exchanges provide a broad set of services, including corporate listing services, trade execution, market information and in certain instances clearing and settlement services, in both the U.S. and internationally. The main function of a cash equities exchange is fair, transparent and efficient price discovery for listed securities. Exchanges meet this objective by operating interactive marketplaces, either through electronic networks, or with increasing rarity, on physical trading floors, where buyers and sellers interact and, as such, they are under strict regulatory surveillance according to established rules and regulations.    From 1996 through 2006, reported cash equities volume traded has experienced growth of approximately 121% on a global basis. The key drivers of cash equities trading volume growth are: improved trading technology, growth in alternative investment vehicles (i.e., hedge funds) and lower trading costs.        •    Advances in technology have increased communication speed, improved information availability, facilitated the globalization of trading, and lowered transaction costs. These developments also create new opportunities for regulators to improve the trading environment. As regulators level the playing     13    Table of Contents       field, market participants are continuing their innovation. For example, advances in algorithmic trading are expected to account for a rapidly increasing share of total trading volume. Algorithmic trading is expected to account for almost 25% of total global trading volume by 2008 up from only 14% in 2003. According to research by Celent, LLC, this rapid trade volume growth is being driven by increasingly sophisticated trading tools, as well as improved pre- and post-trade analytics.        •    Hedge funds, which often rely on higher-volume trading strategies, have experienced a CAGR of approximately 16% in assets under management from 2000 through 2006. Although hedge funds represent just 5% of all U.S. assets under management, they account for approximately 30% of all U.S. equity trading volume, according to the SEC.        •    Fees charged by major exchanges, governmental and regulatory bodies, and intermediaries have, on a per transaction basis, decreased considerably. According to research by ITG, a recognized data analytics firm, trading costs have fallen by approximately 35% for large investors over the past two years. These lower transaction fees encourage increased participation by all market participants, from the largest institutional investors to individual retail investors.    Market organization trends    The exchange industry has been undergoing a historic reorganization. Beginning with the demutualization of many major exchanges worldwide, exchange providers have been seeking greater economies of scale and broader scope both geographically and by asset class. Globally, market participants are demanding greater performance and flexibility from exchanges. At the same time, regulatory initiatives such as Regulation NMS in the U.S. and MiFID in Europe have caused shifts in both exchange business models and boundaries.    More recently, mergers and acquisitions have played a pivotal role in changing the exchange landscape. Nasdaq has agreed to combine with OMX and acquire PHLX and BSX, in addition to its acquisition of INET in December 2005 and Brut in September 2004. In 2007, the NYSE merged with Euronext after acquiring Archipelago Holdings, the parent of the Pacific Exchange and the Archipelago ECN, in 2006. In addition, in early 2008, NYSE agreed to acquire Amex. In July 2007, the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange merged, forming one of the largest financial exchanges in the world. Several broker-dealers have purchased or created equity ECNs and other trading platforms. Most of these new entrants have limited liquidity, however. Additionally, in both the U.S. and Europe, there has been increased use of electronic trading systems specializing primarily in large block trades, such as LiquidNet, Pipeline Trading and Investment Technology Group’s POSIT platform.    European exchanges have also been active participants in the changing face of the industry. In 2002, Euronext was formed through the merger of the Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris exchanges. Euronext subsequently acquired the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, or LIFFE, and the Portuguese exchange, Bolsa de Valores de Lisboa e Porto. In June 2007, LSE acquired Borsa Italiana while Deutsche Börse acquired the International Securities Exchange in the U.S. in April 2007. In November 2006, OMX acquired the Iceland Stock Exchange and in October 2006 purchased a minority stake in the Oslo Stock Exchange. In addition to merger and acquisition activity, there have been several attempts by exchanges to establish subsidiary markets outside their home countries.    Principal exchange activities    Equities trading function. Both in the U.S. as well as in Europe, there is tremendous competition between exchanges and ECNs seeking to be the venue on which equity securities are traded. Currently in the U.S., exchange-listed securities trade not just on the exchange on which they are listed, but also through other market centers including ECNs and regional exchanges. After the full implementation of MiFID, similar trading rules will commence in Europe. As a result, regulatory infrastructure, total transaction costs, the depth and breadth of liquidity, the quality of value-added customer services, reputation and cost of trade execution should become increasingly relevant.    14    Table of Contents Listing function. The market for listing services is primarily dependent on the economy, access to and costs for alternative sources of financing as well as the perception of the attractiveness of exchange listing and financing. Registered securities exchanges provide a venue for corporate and ETF issuers to list their equity securities for trading by market participants worldwide. There is substantial competition for listings, which are gained either through an IPO by a private company, an upgrade from the over-the-counter market, or OTC, or listing switches gained at the expense of a competitor.    Market data function. Demand from investors for high quality information to inform investment decisions is very strong. Since an increasingly large portion of trading today is automated, requirements for the speed of information delivery are also escalating. Laws, regulations and increasing demand from investors for reliable information provided on a real-time basis are all driving the development of the market for communications tools. Companies use these tools to distribute information to the media, analysts, professional traders and private investors in an efficient manner.    The equity exchange industry in the U.S.    Equities trading function. The main participants in the U.S. cash equities marketplace are The Nasdaq Stock Market, the NYSE, the Amex, a number of regional exchanges (Chicago and the National Stock Exchange in Cincinnati) and ECNs (sometimes referred to as alternative trading systems, or ATS).    The Nasdaq Stock Market serves as one of two principal market centers for buying and selling exchange-listed securities in the U.S. Additionally, there are other exchange trading venues such as Amex and regional exchanges. Unlike the specialist-based or hybrid markets, such as Amex or NYSE, The Nasdaq Stock Market is a fully electronic, screen-based, enhance order book system where market makers’ bids and offers can be reviewed and accessed for automatic execution by all market participants at any time. In addition, The Nasdaq Stock Market system provides a mechanism for all market participants (i.e., both order entry firms and brokers or market makers) to post non-marketable limit orders and to access posted limit orders both for their own account and when representing their customers on an agency basis, further enhancing liquidity.    The average daily trading volume on U.S. exchanges increased from 3.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2000 to 6.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. Total U.S. equity trading volumes grew approximately 25.7% during 2007 as compared the prior year. Industry growth is driven by economic expansion, increased volatility, lower trading costs and the shift away from floor-based to electronic trading platforms with significantly enhanced trading technology that provides faster execution speeds. Growth in U.S. trading has also been significantly influenced by increased participation from retail and overseas investors and regulatory changes.    Listing function. The Nasdaq Stock Market and the NYSE are the primary listing venues for equity securities in the U.S. Additionally, the Amex has a smaller number of listings. At December 31, 2007, there were 3,135 listings on The Nasdaq Stock Market.    Of the 213 IPOs on U.S. equity markets during 2007, 132, or approximately 62%, chose to list on The Nasdaq Stock Market, raising approximately $16.8 billion in equity capital, while the remainder listed on the NYSE. Of the 206 IPOs on U.S. equity markets during 2006, 137, or approximately 67%, chose to list on The Nasdaq Stock Market, raising approximately $17.4 billion in equity capital, while the remainder listed on the NYSE or other markets.    Market data function. Nasdaq serves as one of two central providers of real-time quote and trade data for U.S. exchange listed securities. It acts jointly with other national securities exchanges to collect and disseminate a consolidated stream of quotation and transaction information under national market system plans approved by the SEC. Nasdaq is the central provider of data for Nasdaq-listed securities and NYSE is the central provider of data for NYSE and Amex-listed securities.    15    Table of Contents Regulation NMS. Regulation NMS, which was fully implemented in 2007, has been a key driver behind the changes in execution services and market data businesses in the U.S. The following information describes the key directives of the regulation.        •    Best price rule: Among the most significant provisions of Regulation NMS are order protection, also referred to as the “best price” rule, and fair access regulations. The order protection rule requires exchanges and other trading centers to establish procedures designed to prevent the execution of trades at prices inferior to “protected” quotations displayed by other exchanges. Under the order protection rule, each exchange must interact with any market center offering a superior price before it can execute a trade at an inferior price on its systems for other reasons (such as trade size).        •    Fair access rule: The access rule requires market centers to provide fair and non-discriminatory access to quotations, establishes a limit on access fees to harmonize the pricing of quotations across different trading centers and requires all exchanges to maintain written rules that prohibit their members from displaying quotations that lock or cross automated quotations.        •    Market information rule: Regulation NMS also contains several market data rules that update the requirements for consolidating, distributing and displaying market information. These rules amend the current plans which disseminate consolidated market information by modifying the formulas for allocating plan revenues and broadening participation in plan governance.        •    Sub-penny rule: The sub-penny rule prohibits market participants from displaying quotations in pricing increments smaller than a penny, with exceptions for quotes and orders priced at less than $1.00 per share.    Outlook and future trends    Trading volume in both the U.S. and European equity markets has continued to grow meaningfully over the past few years. Industry growth is being driven by additional demand for active and transaction-intensive asset management, the shift away from floor-based to electronic trading platforms, lower transaction costs, narrow spreads, significantly enhanced technology, increased participation from retail investors and regulatory changes. As pension funds and institutional investors shift greater allocations to hedge funds and alternative asset managers who use sophisticated and complex trading strategies, volumes are expected to continue to increase. The strategies implemented by these investors, including quantitative and program trading models are transaction-intensive. Electronic trading has enabled buyside traders to access the market with minimal infrastructure or systems costs. Furthermore, as sellside trading firms have grown operations and pushed toward faster and more automated trading, volumes have increased substantially, creating value not only for trading firms, but for the exchanges handling the trading.    At the same time, macro and demographic trends are helping to drive ongoing volume growth. The rising life expectancy of an aging population is forcing a larger absolute number of investors to seek higher returns in the global equity markets. This is also contributing to changes for traditional institutional investors whose focus was to ensure that their own investment strategy was more profitable than a comparative index. Today, demand is instead directed toward more stable returns, measured in absolute terms over a longer period, for which more active and transaction-intensive management is required. An increasing number of hedge funds have entered the industry to cater to this increased institutional demand. Other participants, such as traditional pension funds, are adopting new investment strategies and are also becoming increasingly active in their management. At the same time, the use of more advanced and innovative methods and technologies for securities trading is spreading, resulting in an increasing number of transactions and a higher turnover rate.    16    Table of Contents Competition    The equity securities markets are intensely competitive. We compete in our industry against the NYSE, Amex, regional exchanges and ECNs based on a number of factors, including the quality of our technological and regulatory infrastructure, total transaction costs, the depth and breadth of our markets, the quality of our value-added customer services, reputation and price In addition, recent cross-border mergers, such as the merger of NYSE and Euronext, and the continuing trend toward global consolidation among the exchanges may be expected to result in competition on a more global scale.    In recent years, the marketplace has been altered by the entry of new ECNs in the trade execution business and market participants’ acquisition and investment in existing ECNs or regional exchanges. For example, TradeBot launched the Better Alternative Trading System, or BATS ECN in 2006. Following the launch, a number of major investment firms including Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch & Co., Morgan Stanley, Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., Lime Brokerage LLC, Credit Suisse, GETCO Holdings Co. LLC and Wedbush Inc. have made minority investments in BATS. Also in 2006, Citigroup announced its acquisition of OnTrade, Inc. from NexTrade, and Knight Capital Group, Inc. acquired Attain (Direct Edge) in 2005. Citadel Derivatives Group and Goldman Sachs Group subsequently made investments in Direct Edge. Additional new entrants may emerge, potentially posing a competitive threat to more established industry participants. While many of the new entrants have limited liquidity, some have attracted significant levels of equity order volume through aggressive pricing and, we believe, from volume originating with their broker-dealer investors. In addition, there remains interest in electronic trading systems specializing primarily in large block trades, such as LiquidNet, Pipeline Trading and Investment Technology Group’s POSIT platform.    Also, other regional exchanges, such as the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc., the National Stock Exchange and the International Securities Exchange have recently entered into investment agreements with other participants in the securities industry, with the objective of enabling them to better compete with other exchanges.    Equity Securities Trading. We experience competition in our core trading activities such as execution services, quoting and trading capabilities, and reporting services. Our principal competitors for trading equity securities in the U.S. include NYSE, Amex, the regional exchanges and ECNs. Many of our competitors have engaged in aggressive price competition by reducing the trade execution transaction fees they charge their customers. As a result, we also implemented pricing changes in 2007 to lower certain trading fees. We periodically reexamine our pricing structure to ensure that our fees remain competitive.    Data Services. Our revenues from the sale of market information products and services are also under competitive threat from other securities exchanges that trade Nasdaq-listed securities. Current SEC regulations permit these regional exchanges and FINRA’s Alternative Display Facility to quote and trade Nasdaq-listed securities. Trade reporting facilities regulated by FINRA are also operated by Nasdaq and one regional exchange and are proposed by other exchanges. Nasdaq’s UTP Plan entitles these exchanges, FINRA’s Alternate Display Facility, and the trade reporting facilities to a share of UTP Plan tape fees, in proportion to such exchange’s share of trading as measured by dollar volume and number of qualified trades. Nasdaq’s UTP Plan also entitles exchanges to a share of UTP Plan tape fees based on their quoting activity. Participants in the UTP Plan have used tape fee revenues to establish payment for order flow arrangements with their members and customers. In January 2004, we implemented a new tiered pricing structure and the Nasdaq General Revenue Sharing Program, which provided incentives for quoting market participants to send orders and report trades to The Nasdaq Market Center. We continuously evaluate and refine both programs. To remain competitive, in July 2006, we changed the terms of the program and established a new Nasdaq Data Revenue Sharing Program. We recently proposed changing the program effective first quarter 2008 and may adjust either program in the future to respond to competitive pressures.    We are also responding aggressively to competition by updating and innovating new data products to provide market participants with increased functionality and new and more extensive market information.    17    Table of Contents Listings. Our primary competitor for larger company listings on The Nasdaq Stock Market is the NYSE. We also compete, to a limited extent, with Amex for listing of smaller, less active companies. As result of the NYSE-Archipelago merger and proposed NYSE-Amex merger, the NYSE group is aggressively pursuing listings of smaller companies that have not historically qualified for listing on the NYSE for listing on its junior market. In addition, we face competition for listing of foreign companies.    Financial Products. Nasdaq-sponsored financial products are subject to intense competition from other ETFs, derivatives and structured products as investment alternatives. The source of this competition is not only large ETF family sponsors, but also, increasingly, other mutual fund sponsors originating ETFs.    Likewise, The Nasdaq Stock Market is subject to intense competition for the listing of these financial products from other exchanges. The indexes on which these products are based face competition from other indexes which can be considered competitive with Nasdaq indexes. For example, there are a number of indexes that aim to track the technology sector and may from time to time have a high degree of correlation with the Nasdaq-100 Index and Nasdaq Composite Index. We face competition from investment banks, markets or other product developers in designing products that meet investor needs.    Employees    As of February 14, 2008, we had 891 employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or is represented by a union. Nasdaq considers its relations with its employees to be good.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or operating results could be adversely affected.    We may not be able to successfully combine the Nasdaq and OMX businesses.    We intend to close our combination with OMX by the end of February 2008. Rationalizing, coordinating and integrating the operations of Nasdaq and OMX will involve complex technological, operational and personnel-related challenges. This process will be time-consuming and expensive and may disrupt our business. The difficulties, costs and delays that could be encountered may include:        •    unforeseen difficulties, costs or complications in combining the companies’ operations, which could lead to us not achieving the synergies we anticipate;    18    Table of Contents     •    unanticipated incompatibility of systems and operating methods;        •    inability to use capital assets efficiently to develop the business of the combined company;        •    the difficulty of complying with government-imposed regulations in both the United States and Europe, which may be different from each other;        •    resolving possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between Nasdaq and OMX;        •    the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and other strategic opportunities;        •    the integration of Nasdaq’s and OMX’s respective businesses, operations and workforces;        •    the retention of key employees and the management of OMX and Nasdaq;        •    the implementation of disclosure controls, internal controls and financial reporting systems at OMX to enable the combined company to comply with the requirements of, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and U.S. securities laws and regulations required as a result of the combined company’s status as a reporting company under the Exchange Act;        •    the coordination of geographically separate organizations;        •    the coordination and consolidation of ongoing and future research and development efforts;        •    possible tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company;        •    possible modification of OMX’s operating control standards in order for the combined company to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, which is required as a result of the combined company’s status as a reporting company under the Exchange Act;        •    the retention and recruitment of employees to support existing and new aspects of the combined company’s business and new technology development;        •    the pre-tax restructuring and revenue investment costs, which are estimated at $150 million to be incurred in the two years following completion of the acquisition;        •    the retention of strategic partners and attracting new strategic partners;        •    negative impacts on employee morale and performance as a result of job changes and reassignments; and        •    regulatory issues.    For these reasons, the combined company may not achieve the anticipated financial and strategic benefits, including cost savings from operational efficiencies and synergies, from the combination of the businesses of Nasdaq and OMX, and any actual cost savings and synergies may be lower than we currently expect and may take a longer time to achieve than we currently anticipate, and we may fail to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the combination of the two companies.    We will need to invest in our operations to integrate OMX and other transactions and to maintain and grow our business, and we may need additional funds to do so.    We depend on the availability of adequate capital to maintain and develop our business. We believe that we can meet our current capital requirements, including our planned combination with OMX and the proposed acquisitions of the Boston Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, from internally generated funds, cash on hand and available borrowings. If we are unable to fund our capital requirements as currently planned, however, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    19    Table of Contents In addition to our debt service obligations, we will need to continue to invest in our operations through 2010 to integrate OMX. If we do not achieve the expected operating results, we will need to reallocate our cash resources. This may include borrowing additional funds to service debt payments, which may impair our ability to make investments in our business or to integrate OMX.    Should we need to raise funds through incurring additional debt, we may become subject to covenants even more restrictive than those contained in the debt instruments we plan to enter into in connection with our acquisition of OMX. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity, our equity holders will suffer dilution. Thus, there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms or at all.    Our leverage limits our financial flexibility.    Our indebtedness as of December 31, 2007 was approximately $118.4 million. In connection with the closing of our upcoming transactions, we expect to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness, including the issuance of up to $425 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes (not including any additional notes issued under an overallotment option for up to $50 million in aggregate principal amount) and borrowing up to $2.0 billion under senior secured loans under credit facilities. We may borrow up to an additional $75.0 million under a revolver.    Our leverage could:        •    reduce funds available to us for operations and general corporate purposes or for capital expenditures as a result of the dedication of a substantial portion of our consolidated cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;        •    increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions;        •    place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors with less debt; and        •    affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for refinancing indebtedness, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures or other purposes.    In addition, we must comply with the covenants in our credit facilities. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to grant liens, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, sell assets, make certain payments, conduct transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate. Failure to meet any of the covenant terms of our credit facilities could result in an event of default. If an event of default occurs, and we are unable to receive a waiver of default, our lenders may increase our borrowing costs, restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings, accelerate all amounts outstanding or enforce their interest against all collateral pledged.    The securities market business is highly competitive.    We face competition from numerous entities in the securities market industry, including competition for trading services, listings, and financial products from other exchanges and market centers. This competition includes both product and price competition and could increase as a result of the registration of new exchanges and market centers in the United States and Europe.    In addition, the liberalization and globalization of world markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital, greater international participation in local markets and more competition. Both in the U.S. and in other countries, the competition among exchanges and other execution venues has become more intense.    In the last several years, the structure of the securities industry has changed significantly through demutualizations and consolidations. In response to growing competition, many marketplaces in both Europe and     20    Table of Contents  the United States have demutualized to provide greater flexibility for future growth. The securities industry is also experiencing consolidation, creating a more intense competitive environment. In addition, a high proportion of business in the securities market is becoming increasingly concentrated in a smaller number of institutions and our revenue may therefore become concentrated in a smaller number of customers.    Examples of these new competitive forces include:        •    the creation of NYSE Euronext, Inc. in April 2007 and its pending acquisition of Amex (see discussion below);        •    new ECNs operating in the U.S. cash equities trading market, such as Direct Edge, Lava Flow and BATS;        •    proposed new U.S. exchanges, such as BATS, which has filed an application to register as a U.S. registered national securities exchange;        •    the combination of Deutsche Börse AG and International Securities Exchange Holdings, Inc.;        •    electronic trading systems specializing in large volume trades, such as LiquidNet, Pipeline Trading and Investment Technology Group’s POSIT platform;        •    a number of investment banks have set up a multilateral trading facility in Europe, also known as Turquoise;        •    a number of investment banks have launched a multilateral trade reporting facility in Europe, also known as Project Boat;        •    alternative trading platforms in Europe such as Equiduct, Chi-X and Plus Markets;        •    alternative trade reporting platforms in Europe such as Reuters Trade Publication;        •    the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc., the National Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange all have investment agreements with other participants in the securities industry;        •    the International Securities Exchange’s and the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s launch of cash equities exchanges in September 2006 and March 2007, respectively; and        •    global electronic interdealer brokers, such as ICAP.    If these or other trading venues are successful, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.    Because of these market trends, we face intense competition. Competitors may develop market trading platforms that are more competitive than ours. If we are unable to compete successfully in this environment, our business, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.    Price competition has affected and could continue to affect our business.    The securities trading industry in the United States is characterized by intense price competition. We have in the past lowered prices and increased rebates for trade executions to attempt to gain or maintain market share. These strategies have not always been successful and have at times hurt operating performance. Additionally, we have also been, and may once again be, required to adjust pricing to respond to actions by competitors, which adversely impacts operating results.    The securities trading industry also competes with respect to the pricing of market data. In addition, we are subject to price competition with respect to proprietary products for pre-trade book data and for post-trade last sale data. In the future our competitors may offer market data rebates for quotes and trades on their systems.    21    Table of Contents Our trade reporting facility (which we operate jointly with FINRA for the purpose of accepting reports of off-exchange trades) faces competition from the trade reporting facilities operated jointly with FINRA by the National Stock Exchange and the NYSE. Our trade reporting facility also faces competition from FINRA’s alternative display facility. Our competitors’ market data rebate programs for trade reporting could lead to a loss of market share and decreased revenues.    The NYSE’s recent mergers and acquisitions activity has created a strong competitor in our industry that has a similar strategy to ours.    The combination of the NYSE and Euronext creates strong competition for us. The combination makes NYSE Euronext more competitive in attracting new listings. NYSE Euronext is also enhancing its electronic trading capabilities, which compete directly with Nasdaq’s and may result in NYSE Euronext’s trading volume increasing to our detriment. On January 17, 2008, NYSE Euronext issued a press release announcing it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Amex. According to the press release, NYSE Euronext expects the acquisition of Amex to enhance NYSE Euronext’s scale in U.S. options (making it the third largest U.S. options marketplace), and in ETFs, closed-end funds, structured products and cash equities. If NYSE Euronext succeeds in attracting disproportionately more trading volume or additional listings, this may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.    We face significant competition in our securities trading business, which could reduce our transactions, trade reporting and market information revenues and negatively impact our financial results.    We compete for trading of securities listed on Nasdaq, NYSE and Amex. Any decision by market participants to quote, execute or report their trades in the U.S. through other exchanges, electronic communications networks, ECNs, or the alternative display facility maintained by FINRA, could have a negative impact on our share of quotes and trades in securities traded through The Nasdaq Market Center.    Although we trade a large percentage of securities of Nasdaq-listed companies, we face strong competition from other exchanges and emerging players in the market. For non-Nasdaq-listed securities, the other national exchanges collectively offer greater liquidity than we do. Accordingly, we face greater obstacles in trying to attract trading volume in non-Nasdaq-listed securities.    Our responses to competition may not be sufficient to regain lost business or prevent other market participants from shifting some of their quoting and/or trade reporting to other industry participants. We may need to reduce prices to remain competitive.    We must adapt to significant competition in our listing business.    We must adapt to significant competition in our listing business from other exchanges. Historically, the NYSE has been our largest competitor, and we have competed with the NYSE primarily for listings of larger domestic and international companies. In addition, on occasion, issuers may transfer their listings from Nasdaq to other venues. While the reduction in initial listings or the loss of one or more large issuers could decrease our listing revenues, it could cause an even more significant decrease in revenues from the quoting, reporting and trading of those issuers’ securities.    Nasdaq’s revenues may be affected by competition in the business for financial products.    We have grown our financial products business, which creates indexes and licenses them for Nasdaq-branded financial products. Nasdaq-sponsored financial products are subject to intense competition from other ETFs, derivatives and structured products as investment alternatives. Our revenues may be adversely affected by increasing competition from competitors’ financial products designed to replicate or correlate with the performance of our financial products. In addition, the legal and regulatory climate, which supports the licensing     22    Table of Contents  of these financial products, has changed in a manner which is likely to adversely impact our ability to successfully license our products. Further, many other entrants have recently emerged who not only compete with us for future growth opportunities, but who may also introduce products that erode the position of our current offerings, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results.    A decrease in trading volume will decrease our trading revenues.    Trading volume is directly affected by economic, political and market conditions, broad trends in business and finance, unforeseen market closures or other disruptions in trading, the level and volatility of interest rates, inflation, changes in price levels of securities and the overall level of investor confidence. Because a significant percentage of our revenues is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market, it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes would lower revenues and may adversely affect our operating results. In addition, investor confidence and trader interest, and thus trading volume, can be affected by factors outside our control, such as the publicity surrounding investigations and prosecutions for corporate governance or accounting irregularities at listed companies.    Declines in the initial public offering market could have an adverse effect on our revenues.    Stagnation or decline in the initial public offering market will impact the number of new listings on The NASDAQ Stock Market, and thus our related revenues. We recognize revenue from new listings on a straight-line basis over an estimated six-year service period. As a result, a stagnant market for initial public offerings could cause a decrease in deferred revenues for future years.    We may experience fluctuations in our operating results.    The financial services industry is risky and unpredictable and is directly affected by many national and international factors beyond our control. Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results by causing a substantial decline in the financial services markets and reduced trading volume.    Additionally, since borrowings under the credit facilities that we plan to enter into in connection with our combination with OMX bear interest at variable rates and we do not have interest rate hedges in place on this debt, any increase in interest rates will increase our interest expense and reduce our cash flow. Other than variable rate debt, we believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnifies the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results. As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a relatively larger impact on operating results. A substantial portion of our operating expenses will be related to personnel costs, regulation and corporate overhead, none of which can be adjusted quickly and some of which cannot be adjusted at all. Our operating expense levels will be based on our expectations for future revenue. If actual revenue is below management’s expectations, or if our expenses increase before revenues do, both revenues less liquidity rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. Because of these factors, it is possible that our operating results or other operating metrics may fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors. If this happens, the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.    We must control our costs to remain profitable.    We base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services. A decline in the demand for our products and services may reduce our revenues without a corresponding decline in expenses since we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis. Our failure to achieve goals on cost savings will have an adverse impact on our results of operations.    23    Table of Contents We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological and other competitive changes affecting our industry.    The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent enhancements to existing products and services, the introduction of new services and products and changing customer demands. If our platform fails to function as expected, our business would be negatively affected. In addition, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully develop, introduce or market new services and products or if we need to adopt costly and customized technology for our services and products. Further, our failure to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences, or any significant delays in product development efforts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    System limitations, failures or security breaches could harm our business.    Our business depends on the integrity and performance of the computer and communications systems supporting us. If our systems cannot expand to cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and services. These consequences could result in lower trading volumes, financial losses, decreased customer service and satisfaction and regulatory sanctions. Nasdaq and OMX have experienced occasional systems failures and delays in the past and could experience future systems failures and delays.    If our trading volume increases unexpectedly, we will need to expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure. We do not know whether we will be able to accurately project the rate, timing or cost of any increases, or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate any increases in a timely manner.    Our systems and operations also are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, natural disasters, power loss, sabotage or terrorism, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. We have active and aggressive programs in place to identify and minimize our exposure to these vulnerabilities and work in collaboration with the technology industry to share corrective measures with our business partners. Although we currently maintain and expect to maintain multiple computer facilities that are designed to provide redundancy and back-up to reduce the risk of system disruptions and have facilities in place that are expected to maintain service during a system disruption, such systems and facilities may prove inadequate. Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our services could impair our reputation, damage our brand name and negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.    The adoption and implementation of Regulation NMS by the SEC could adversely affect our business.    On April 6, 2005, the SEC adopted Regulation NMS. Regulation NMS’s four primary components are: the Order Protection Rule, the Access Rule, the Market Data Rule and the Sub-Penny Rule. We have incurred technological and other costs in changing our systems and operations so that we can comply with these rules. Although the major provisions of Regulation NMS were largely phased in over the course of 2007, the impact of Regulation NMS is hard to predict and there may be problems or competitive challenges that we do not foresee that adversely affect our business due to Regulation NMS. Regulation NMS may increase competition in securities listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market or other exchanges from existing or new competitors.    Regulatory changes and changes in market structure could have a material adverse effect on our business.    Nasdaq operates in a highly regulated industry. In recent years, the securities trading industry and, in particular, the securities markets, have been subject to significant regulatory changes. Moreover, the securities markets have been the subject of increasing governmental and public scrutiny in response to a number of recent developments and inquiries. Any of these factors or events may result in future regulatory or other changes, although we cannot predict the nature of these changes or their impact on our business at this time. Our market participants also operate in a highly regulated industry. The SEC and other regulatory authorities could impose     24    Table of Contents  regulatory changes that could impact the ability of our market participants to use The Nasdaq Market Center or could adversely affect The NASDAQ Stock Market. Regulatory changes by the SEC or other regulatory authorities could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on The NASDAQ Stock Market.    Nasdaq is subject to extensive regulation that may harm our ability to compete with less regulated entities.    Under current U.S. federal securities laws, changes in our rules and operations, including our pricing structure, must be reviewed, and in many cases explicitly approved by the SEC. The SEC may approve, disapprove or recommend changes to proposals that we submit. In addition, the SEC may delay the initiation of the public comment process or the approval process. This delay in approving changes, or the altering of any proposed change, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We must compete not only with ECNs that are not subject to the same SEC approval process but also with other exchanges that have lower regulation and surveillance costs than us. There is a risk that trading will shift to exchanges that charge lower fees because, among other reasons, they spend significantly less on regulation.    In addition, Nasdaq’s registered broker-dealer subsidiaries, Nasdaq Execution Services, LLC and NASDAQ Option Services, LLC are subject to regulation by the SEC, FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations. Any failure to comply with these broker-dealer regulations could have a material effect on the operation of our business, financial condition and operating results. These subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity, which require that they comply with certain minimum capital requirements. The SEC and FINRA impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, dictate the ratio of debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the Uniform Net Capital Rule and NYSE and FINRA rules impose certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC, the NYSE and FINRA for certain withdrawals of capital.    Nasdaq has self-regulatory obligations and also operates for-profit businesses, and these two roles may create conflicts of interest.    We have obligations to regulate and monitor activities on The NASDAQ Stock Market and ensure compliance with applicable law and the rules of our market by market participants and Nasdaq-listed companies. The SEC staff has expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest of “for-profit” markets performing the regulatory functions of a self-regulatory organization. Although Nasdaq outsources the majority of its market regulation functions to FINRA, Nasdaq does perform regulatory functions related to its listed companies and its market. In addition, as part of Nasdaq’s application for exchange registration, Nasdaq agreed that 20% of the directors of its exchange subsidiary will be elected by members of the exchange rather than the equity holders of the subsidiary. Any failure by Nasdaq to diligently and fairly regulate its market or to otherwise fulfill its regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation, prompt SEC scrutiny and adversely affect our business and reputation.    Recent SEC rulemaking has liberalized the foreign private issuer deregistration rules.    In March 2007, the SEC adopted rules that make it easier for foreign private issuers to deregister and terminate their SEC reporting obligations. Under the deregistration rule, a foreign private issuer can deregister equity securities if its average U.S. trading volume over a 12-month period represents 5% or less of its worldwide trading volume, so long as it meets certain requirements. Once a foreign private issuer’s securities are deregistered and the issuer ceases its Exchange Act reporting, those securities are no longer eligible for trading on any public exchange in the U.S. As a result, we may face the loss of listing and trading services revenues associated with foreign private issuers who chose to deregister under the SEC rules.    25    Table of Contents Regulatory recognition of foreign exchanges may harm our ability to compete with less regulated entities.     Under current U.S. federal securities laws, foreign exchanges seeking to operate in the U.S. must meet substantially all of the regulatory requirements we face. The SEC has the authority to exempt foreign exchanges from these requirements and currently has granted one foreign exchange, Tradepoint LLC, an exemption based on low volume and other restrictions. Consequently, Virt-x Exchange Limited (the successor to Tradepoint LLC) is the only foreign exchange able to operate in the U.S. without meeting all the regulatory requirements we face. Recently, the SEC has begun discussing the possibility of reciprocal recognition of exchanges operating under comparable regulatory regimes. Based on the extent and manner in which the SEC pursues reciprocal recognition, there is a possibility that other foreign exchanges may enter the U.S. market without meeting all the regulatory requirements we meet. The entry of foreign exchanges into the U.S. market without complying with U.S. regulatory obligations would create additional competitive pressure on us, particularly in the trading of dual-listed foreign securities.    The legal and regulatory environment in the United States may make it difficult for The NASDAQ Stock Market to attract the secondary listings of non-U.S. companies.    The NASDAQ Stock Market competes to obtain the listing of non-U.S. issuer securities (in addition to the listing of U.S. issuer securities). However, the legal and regulatory environment in the United States, as well as the perception of this environment, has made and may continue to make it more difficult for Nasdaq to attract these listings and may therefore adversely affect our competitive position. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes a stringent set of corporate governance, reporting and other requirements on publicly listed companies in the U.S. Significant resources are necessary for issuers to come into and remain in compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which has had, and may continue to have, an impact on the ability of Nasdaq to attract and retain listings. At the same time, international companies are increasingly seeking access to the U.S. markets through private transactions that do not require listing or trading in the U.S. public markets, such as through Rule 144A transactions. Non-U.S. issuers may choose to list with non-U.S. securities exchanges exclusively without a secondary listing in the United States because they perceive the U.S. regulatory requirements and the U.S. litigation environment as too cumbersome and costly. If Nasdaq is unable to successfully attract the listing business of non-U.S. issuers, the perception of The NASDAQ Stock Market as a premier listing venue may be diminished, and our competitive position may be adversely affected or our operating results could suffer.    We are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, counterparties and clearing agents.    We are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, counterparties and clearing agents. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. In particular, our subsidiary Nasdaq Execution Services, LLC may be exposed to credit risk, due to the default of trading counterparties, in connection with the clearing and routing services Nasdaq Execution Services provides for our trading customers.    System trades in Nasdaq-listed securities, NYSE-listed securities, AMEX-listed securities and trades routed to other market centers for Exchange members are cleared by Nasdaq Execution Services, as a member of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC).    Pursuant to the rules of the NSCC and Nasdaq Execution Services’ clearing agreement, Nasdaq Execution Services is liable for any losses incurred due to counterparty or a clearing agent’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations, either by making payment or delivering securities. Adverse movements in the prices of securities that are subject to these transactions can increase our credit risk. However, we believe that the risk of material loss is limited, as Nasdaq Execution Services’ customers are not permitted to trade on margin and NSCC rules limit counterparty risk on self-cleared transactions by establishing credit limit and capital deposit requirements for all brokers that clear with NSCC. Nasdaq Execution Services has never incurred a liability due to a customer’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade. Credit difficulties or insolvency or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency of one or more larger or visible market     26    Table of Contents  participants could also result in market-wide credit difficulties or other market disruptions. We also have credit risk related to transaction fees that are billed to customers on a monthly basis, in arrears. Our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our customers are financial institutions whose ability to satisfy their contractual obligations may be impacted by volatile securities markets. Credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.    Failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.    Our future success depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified professional personnel. Competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel, in particular senior officers, will be dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. There is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who will be relied upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives. In particular, we may have to incur costs to replace senior executive officers or other key employees who leave, and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner.    We are highly dependent on the continued services of Robert Greifeld, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and other executive officers and key employees who possess extensive financial markets knowledge and technology skills. Other than employment agreements with Mr. Greifeld and Nasdaq’s general counsel, we do not have employment agreements with key executive officers, which would prevent them from leaving and competing with us. We do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our executive officers, managers, key employees or technical personnel. The loss of the services of these persons for any reason, as well as any negative market or industry perception arising from those losses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    We are subject to risks relating to litigation and potential securities law liability.    Many aspects of our business potentially involve substantial liability risks. Although we are immune from private suits for self-regulatory organization activities, this immunity only covers certain of our activities, and we and our broker-dealer affiliates could be exposed to liability under federal and state securities laws, other federal and state laws and court decisions, and rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and other regulatory agencies. In addition, we are subject to liability under the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions. These risks include, among others, potential liability from disputes over the terms of a trade, or claims that a system failure or delay cost a customer money, that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a securities transaction. As we intend to defend any such litigation actively, significant legal expenses could be incurred.    In addition, Nasdaq is subject to oversight by the SEC. The SEC regularly examines Nasdaq and its broker-dealer affiliates for compliance with Nasdaq’s obligations under the securities laws. In the case of non-compliance with our obligations under those laws, Nasdaq or its broker-dealer affiliates could be subject to investigation and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties.    Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our brand-building efforts and ability to compete effectively.    To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, clients, strategic partners and others. The protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. We may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.    27    Table of Contents Nasdaq has registered, or applied to register, its trademarks in the United States and in over 50 foreign jurisdictions and has pending U.S. and foreign applications for other trademarks. Nasdaq also maintains copyright protection on its Nasdaq-branded materials and pursues patent protection for Nasdaq-developed inventions and processes.    Effective trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our brand and affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, defending our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.    Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.    One of our competitive strengths is our strong reputation and brand name. Various issues may give rise to reputational risk, including issues relating to:        •    the representation of our business in the media;        •    the accuracy of our financial statements and other financial and statistical information;        •    the quality of our corporate governance structure; and        •    the quality of our products, including the reliability of our transaction-based business, the accuracy of the quote and trade information provided by our market information services business and the accuracy of calculations used by our financial products business for indexes and unit investment trusts.    Damage to our reputation could cause some issuers not to list their securities on our exchange, as well as reduce the trading volume on our exchange or cause us to lose customers in our market information services or financial products businesses. This, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    We are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.    As of August 1, 2006, Nasdaq is a holding company with no direct operating businesses other than the equity interests of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, all our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we require dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to meet cash requirements or to pay dividends. If our subsidiaries are unable to pay us dividends and make other payments to us when needed, we will be unable to satisfy our obligations.    Future acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures may require significant resources and/or result in significant unanticipated losses, costs, or liabilities.    Over the past three years, acquisitions including the acquisitions of INET and Nasdaq Execution Services, LLC (formerly Brut, LLC) and the proposed combination with OMX and acquisitions of PHLX and BSX have been (or, in the case of future acquisitions, are expected to be) significant factors in Nasdaq’s growth. Although we cannot predict our rate of growth as the result of acquisitions with complete accuracy, we believe that additional acquisitions or entering into partnership and joint ventures will be important to our growth strategy. Many of the other potential purchasers of assets in our industry have greater financial resources than we have. Therefore, we cannot be sure that we will be able to complete future acquisitions on terms favorable to us.    We may finance future acquisitions by issuing additional equity and/or debt. The issuance of additional equity in connection with any such transaction could be substantially dilutive to existing shareholders. The issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially. In addition, announcement or implementation of future transactions by us or others could have a material effect on the price of our stock. We could face financial risks associated with incurring additional debt, particularly if the debt resulted in significant     28    Table of Contents  incremental leverage. Additional debt may reduce our liquidity, curtail our access to financing markets, impact our standing with the credit agencies and increase the cash flow required for debt service. Any incremental debt incurred to finance an acquisition could also place significant constraints on the operation of our business.    These equity, debt and managerial commitments may impair the operation of our businesses. Furthermore, any future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail a number of additional risks, including:        •    problems with effective integration of operations;        •    the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;        •    increased operating costs;        •    the diversion of our management team from its other operations;        •    problems with regulatory bodies;        •    exposure to unanticipated liabilities;        •    difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; and        •    changes in our credit rating and financing costs.    Charges to earnings resulting from acquisition, restructuring and integration costs may materially adversely affect the market value of our common stock.     In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we will account for the completion of our transactions with Borse Dubai and OMX using the purchase method of accounting. We will allocate the total estimated purchase price to OMX’s net tangible assets, amortizable intangible assets and non-amortized intangibles, and based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the transactions, record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. Our financial results, including earnings per share, could be adversely affected by a number of financial adjustments required by U.S. GAAP including the following:        •    we will incur additional amortization expense over the estimated useful lives of certain of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the transactions during such estimated useful lives;        •    we may have additional depreciation expense as a result of recording purchased tangible assets at fair value, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as compared to book value as recorded by OMX;        •    to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets; and        •    we will incur certain adjustments to reflect OMX’s financial condition and operating results under U.S. GAAP and U.S. dollars.    We expect to incur costs associated with these transactions, including financial advisors’ fees and legal and accounting fees. In addition, we expect to incur costs associated with realizing synergies from the transactions. These costs may be substantial and may include those related to the severance and stock option acceleration provisions of employee benefit plans, as well as other exit costs. We face potential costs related to employee retention and deployment of physical capital and other integration costs. We have not yet determined the amount of these costs. We expect to account for costs directly related to the transactions, including financial advisors’ costs, legal and accounting fees and certain exit costs associated with OMX’s operations as purchase related adjustments when the transactions are completed, as proscribed under U.S. GAAP. These items will reduce cash balances for the periods in which these costs are paid. Other costs that are not directly related to the transactions, including retention and integration costs, will be recorded as incurred and will negatively impact earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and the price of our common stock.    In addition, from the date of the completion of the transactions, our results of operations will include OMX’s operating results, presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. OMX’s historical consolidated financial     29    Table of Contents  statements for 2004 through 2007 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, which differ in certain material respects from U.S. GAAP. For instance, U.S. GAAP will require OMX to recognize revenue under certain of its technology contracts over the term of the contract rather than at the beginning of the contract. Accordingly, the U.S. GAAP presentation of OMX’s results of operations may not be comparable to its historical financial statements.    Our investment in DIFX may be unsuccessful and could harm us in other ways.    We and Borse Dubai have agreed that in exchange for $50.0 million and the entry into certain licensing and technology agreements, we will acquire 33 1/3% of the outstanding equity of DIFX. We have also committed to providing additional capital, up to $25.0 million, to DIFX under certain circumstances. Our investment in DIFX may be unsuccessful. These investments are in addition to the maximum of approximately SEK 12.6 billion in cash we may pay Borse Dubai for OMX shares. Additionally, these licensing and technology agreements will allow DIFX to use the Nasdaq trademark and exchange technologies from both us and OMX. DIFX’s use may have an adverse effect on us and our brand and other intellectual property. We may not be able to terminate these agreements or end our association with DIFX in a manner that would prevent lasting and potentially significant harm to our brand and reputation, particularly in certain key emerging markets. Our agreements with DIFX will also prevent or limit us from seeking opportunities to grow our business in certain regions, and this may have a negative impact on us in the future.    The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the completion of the transactions with Borse Dubai and OMX.    The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the completion of the transactions with Borse Dubai and OMX if:        •    the combination of Nasdaq’s and OMX’s businesses is unsuccessful;        •    we do not achieve the expected benefits of the combination with OMX as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors; or        •    the effect of the transactions on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors.    The benefits of the combination of Nasdaq and OMX may not be achieved if we cannot effect the compulsory acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding OMX shares.    Under Swedish law, to effect the compulsory acquisition of OMX shares for which valid acceptances have not been received, we are required to have acquired more than 90% of the outstanding OMX shares. As a result, it is possible that we may not acquire a sufficient number of OMX shares to effect a compulsory acquisition of the remaining outstanding OMX shares. Since, in this situation, OMX would not be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nasdaq, this will prevent or delay us from realizing the anticipated benefits (including synergies) from the integration of our operations with OMX’s operations by requiring transactions between OMX and Nasdaq to be on an arm’s-length basis.    We may be required to pay a higher price for some OMX shares as a result of compulsory acquisition proceedings under Swedish law.    In the event that Nasdaq obtains more than 90% of the OMX shares, Nasdaq intends to commence a compulsory acquisition procedure under the Swedish Companies Act to acquire all remaining OMX shares. The cost of the compulsory acquisition proceeding will be borne entirely by Nasdaq.    The purchase price for the OMX shares acquired through a compulsory acquisition procedure will be determined by an arbitration tribunal. The Swedish Companies Act provides that the purchase price for the     30    Table of Contents  remaining OMX shares will be equivalent to the value of the consideration paid by Borse Dubai in its offer for OMX, unless there are any special circumstances at hand that call for a different price. It may take up to two years or more from initiation of the compulsory acquisition procedure until the arbitration tribunal decides on the purchase price. Thereafter, the purchase price will be distributed to the shareholders whose OMX shares were acquired through the compulsory acquisition procedure, together with interest earned at a market rate set by the Swedish Central Bank pursuant to Swedish law.    Nasdaq may elect to request advance title to the OMX shares to be acquired in the compulsory acquisition procedure, in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act. Advance title means that full ownership is obtained by Nasdaq with respect to the remaining OMX shares before the arbitration proceedings regarding the purchase price have been completed. The arbitration tribunal’s granting of advance title would be subject to Nasdaq providing satisfactory security for payment of the purchase price and the accrued interest thereon.    As a result of the compulsory acquisition proceedings under Swedish law, Nasdaq may ultimately have to pay, in the aggregate, a higher price per OMX share in order to purchase the remaining OMX shares that are outstanding after completion of Borse Dubai’s offer for OMX than it has agreed to pay to OMX shareholders who tender through Borse Dubai’s offer.    Risks Relating to an Investment in Our Common Stock    Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our stockholders.    The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile. Broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuations in our stock price may include, among other things:        •    actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;        •    changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our common stock;        •    conditions or trends in our industry, including trading volumes, regulatory changes or changes in the securities marketplace;        •    announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;        •    announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;        •    additions or departures of key personnel; and        •    sales of our common stock, including sales of our common stock by our directors and officers, significant stockholders or our strategic investors.    The market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets.    Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, our equity securities. As of December 31, 2007, there were 138,869,150 shares of our common stock outstanding. All of our common stock is freely transferable, except shares held by our “affiliates,” as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.    The number of freely transferable shares of our common stock will increase upon any exercise of outstanding options pursuant to our stock compensation and stock award plan for our employees. There were 4,610,258 options exercisable as of December 31, 2007 at a weighted average exercise price of $9.58. The number of shares of our common stock outstanding will also increase upon any conversion of our convertible     31    Table of Contents  notes held by Silver Lake Partners, or SLP, and VAB Investors LLC, or VAB, and their respective affiliates, which are currently convertible at a conversion price of $14.50 per share into approximately 8,283,162 shares of our common stock, or any exercise of warrants held by SLP and VAB or their respective affiliates, which are exercisable at a price of $14.50 per share into approximately 1,539,489 shares of our common stock. We have registered the shares underlying SLP, VAB and their affiliates’ notes and warrants on a Form S-3 registration statement, and those shares are freely transferable.    Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and approved exchange rules, including provisions included to address SEC concerns, and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of us and entrench current management.    Our organizational documents place restrictions on the voting rights of certain stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation limits the voting rights of persons (either alone or with related parties) owning more than 5% of the then outstanding votes entitled to be cast on any matter, other than any other person as may be approved by our board of directors prior to the time such person owns more than 5% of the then outstanding votes entitled to be cast on any matter. Any change to the 5% voting limitation would require SEC approval.    In response to the SEC’s concern about a concentration of our ownership, our exchange rules include a rule prohibiting any Nasdaq member or any person associated with a Nasdaq member from beneficially owning more than 20% of our outstanding voting interests. SEC consent would be required before any investor could obtain more than a 20% voting interest in us. Our exchange rules also require the SEC’s approval of any business ventures with one of our members, subject to exceptions.    In addition, our organizational documents contain provisions that may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us, such as a tender offer or takeover proposal that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock. Additionally, certain of these provisions make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in entrenchment of current management.    In addition, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws:        •    require supermajority stockholder approval to remove directors;        •    do not permit stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;        •    require certain advance notice for director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;        •    require supermajority stockholder approval with respect to certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by-laws (including in respect of the provisions set forth above); and        •    authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, or “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval.    Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more (or, in some cases, a holder who previously held 15% or more) of our common stock. In general, Delaware law prohibits a publicly held corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for three years after the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless the corporation’s board of directors and stockholders approve the business combination in a prescribed manner.    32    Table of Contents  Item 1B.
