Item 1A Risk Factors for additional information.  Regulatory Capital Requirements, Stress Testing and Capital Planning. PNC and PNC Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. These requirements have changed, and will continue to change significantly, as a result of the rules adopted by the U.S. banking agencies in July 2013 to implement the new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) known as “Basel III,” as well as to implement certain provisions of Dodd-Frank. The rules adopted in July 2013 generally have three fundamental parts.  The first part, referred to as the Basel III capital rule, among other things, narrows the definition of regulatory capital, requires banking organizations with $15 billion or more in assets (including PNC) to phase-out trust preferred securities from Tier 1 regulatory capital, establishes a new common equity Tier 1 capital regulatory requirement for banking organizations, and revises the capital levels at which PNC and PNC Bank would be subject to prompt corrective action. These rules also require that significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions (as defined in the rule), as well as mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets, be deducted from Tier 1 common regulatory capital to the extent such items individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the organization’s adjusted Basel III common equity Tier 1 regulatory capital. We previously referred to Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital as Basel III Tier 1 common capital. The Basel III capital rule also significantly limits the extent to which minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries (including minority interests in the form of REIT preferred securities) may be included in regulatory capital. In addition, for banking organizations, like PNC, which are subject to the advanced   approaches (described below), the rule includes other comprehensive income related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans as a component of common equity Tier 1 capital. The Basel III capital rule became effective on January 1, 2014 for PNC and PNC Bank, although many provisions are phased-in over a period of years, with the rules generally fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019.  The second part of the rules adopted in July 2013 is referred to as the advanced approaches and materially revises the framework for the risk-weighting of assets under Basel II. The Basel II framework, which was adopted by the Basel Committee in 2004, seeks to provide more risk-sensitive regulatory capital calculations and promote enhanced risk management practices among large, internationally active banking organizations. The advanced approaches modifications adopted by the U.S. banking agencies became effective on January 1, 2014, and generally apply to banking organizations that have $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or that have $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure. Prior to fully implementing the advanced approaches to calculate risk-weighted assets, PNC and PNC Bank must successfully complete a “parallel run” qualification phase. PNC and PNC Bank entered this parallel run qualification phase on January 1, 2013. Although the minimum parallel run qualification period is four quarters, the parallel run period for PNC and PNC Bank, now in its third year, is consistent with the experience of other U.S. banks that have all had multi-year parallel run periods.  The third major part of the rules adopted in July 2013 is referred to as the standardized approach and materially revises the framework for the risk-weighting of assets under Basel I. The standardized approach, for example, establishes a new framework for the risk-weighting of securitization and non-U.S. sovereign exposures, and increases the risk-weights on certain types of assets including high-volatility commercial real estate and past due corporate and retail exposures. The standardized approach took effect on January 1, 2015.  The risk-based capital and leverage rules that the federal banking regulators have adopted require the capital-to-assets ratios of banking organizations, including PNC and PNC Bank, to meet certain minimum standards. The Basel III rule generally divides regulatory capital into three components: common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital (which, together with common equity Tier 1 capital, comprises Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally common stock, retained earnings, qualifying minority interest and, for advanced approaches banking organizations, accumulated other comprehensive income, less the deductions required to be made from common equity Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 generally includes, among other things, perpetual preferred stock and qualifying minority interests, less the deductions required to be made from additional Tier 1. Tier 2 capital generally comprises qualifying subordinated debt.         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 5   Table of Contents   Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, less the deductions required from total capital. For additional information regarding the differences between Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital and Basel I Tier 1 common capital, see the Capital section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report.  Under the regulatory capital rules, a banking organization’s risk-based capital ratios are calculated by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet financial instruments into risk-weighted categories (with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk), which are used to determine the amount of a banking organization’s total risk-weighted assets (RWAs). Under the standardized approach, the nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are generally multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages set forth in the rules and that increase as the perceived credit risk of the relevant asset increases. For certain types of exposures, such as securitization exposures, the standardized approach establishes one or more methodologies that are to be used to calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the exposure.  As a result of the staggered effective dates of the final U.S. capital rules issued in July 2013, as well as the fact that PNC remains in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2014 were based on the definitions of, and deductions from, capital under Basel III (as such definitions and deductions are phased-in for 2014) and Basel I risk-weighted assets (but subject to certain adjustments as defined by the Basel III rules). As of January 1, 2015, and until PNC has exited parallel run, PNC’s regulatory risk-based Basel III ratios will be calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets, and the definitions of, and deductions from, capital under Basel III (as such definitions and deductions are phased-in through 2019). Once PNC exits parallel run, its regulatory risk-based capital ratios will be the lower of the ratios calculated under the standardized approach or the advanced approaches. We refer to the capital ratios calculated using the phased-in Basel III provisions as the Transitional Basel III ratios. The Transitional Basel III regulatory capital ratios of PNC and PNC Bank as of December 31, 2014 exceeded the applicable minimum levels in effect for 2014. For additional information regarding the Transitional Basel III capital ratios of PNC and PNC Bank as of December 31, 2014, as well as the levels necessary to exceed the regulatory minimums and those needed to be considered “well capitalized”, see the Capital portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report.  The Basel III capital rule requires that banking organizations maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%. Moreover, when fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the rule   will require banking organizations to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 7.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of at least 10.5% to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including common stock dividends and share repurchases) and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments. For banking organizations that are subject to the advanced approaches, these higher capital conservation buffer levels above the regulatory minimums could be supplemented by a countercyclical capital buffer of up to an additional 2.5% during periods of excessive credit growth, although this buffer is initially set at zero in the United States.  In December 2014, the Federal Reserve requested comment on proposed rules that would apply an additional risk-based common equity Tier 1 capital surcharge of between 1.0% and 4.5% (when fully phased-in on January 1, 2019) to firms identified as globally systemically important banks (GSIBs) using a scoring methodology that is based on five measures of global systemic importance (size, interconnectedness, substitutability, complexity, and cross-jurisdictional activity). Based on the methodology proposed, PNC would not be subject to the proposed GSIB surcharge. In its December 2014 release, the Federal Reserve indicated that there is a significant gap between the systemic scores of the eight U.S. BHCs that would be subject to the proposed GSIB surcharge and other BHCs (such as PNC).  The regulatory capital framework adopted by the federal banking regulators also requires that banking organizations maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets, referred to as the leverage ratio. Banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 4.0%. As of December 31, 2014, the leverage ratios of PNC and PNC Bank were above the required minimum level.  Under the Basel III capital rule, banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches (such as PNC and PNC Bank) also will be subject to a new minimum 3.0% supplementary leverage ratio that becomes effective on January 1, 2018, with public regulatory reporting of the ratio beginning in 2015. Unlike the existing leverage ratio, the denominator of the supplementary leverage ratio takes into account certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts. Consistent with the January 2014 Basel Committee revisions to the leverage ratio, the U.S. banking agencies in September 2014 adopted final rules that, among other things, revise the denominator of the supplementary leverage ratio and the supplementary leverage ratio disclosures that covered banking organizations are required to make beginning in 2015. In April 2014, the U.S. banking agencies released final rules imposing a higher supplementary leverage ratio requirement on BHCs with total consolidated assets of more than $700 billion or assets under custody of more than $10 trillion, as well as the insured depository institution subsidiaries of these BHCs.         6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents   Based on the asset and custody thresholds adopted in the final rules, these higher supplementary leverage requirements do not apply to PNC or PNC Bank.  The Federal Reserve and the international bodies responsible for establishing globally applicable regulatory standards for banks (the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee) have been working during the past few years on developing a minimum total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirement that would facilitate the orderly resolution of GSIBs by requiring that such firms maintain a minimum amount of regulatory capital and eligible debt that could be converted to equity upon failure. In November 2014, the FSB requested comment on a consultative document that would establish a global framework for the implementation of such a TLAC requirement. As the proposal would apply only to firms that are identified as a GSIB by the FSB, it would not apply to PNC. The comment period on the FSB proposal ended on February 2, 2015.  Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject a banking organization to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal bank regulatory agencies, including a limitation on the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares, the issuance of a capital directive to increase capital and, in severe cases, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. In some cases, the extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Generally, the smaller an institution’s capital base in relation to its risk-weighted or total assets, the greater the scope and severity of the agencies’ powers, ultimately permitting the agencies to appoint a receiver for the institution. Business activities may also be affected by an institution’s capital classification. For instance, only a “well capitalized” insured depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. In addition, in order to remain a financial holding company and engage in the broader range of financial activities authorized for such a company, PNC and PNC Bank must remain “well capitalized.” At December 31, 2014, PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the required ratios for classification as “well capitalized.” The Basel III capital rule revised the thresholds at which an insured depositary institution is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” The new thresholds among other things (i) include the common equity Tier 1 capital metric; (ii) generally increase the amount of Tier 1 capital required to remain within each capital category (other than the “critically undercapitalized” category); and (iii) for institutions subject to the advanced approaches, include a supplementary leverage ratio threshold in the definitions of “adequately capitalized” and “undercapitalized” once the supplementary leverage ratio takes effect as a minimum requirement in 2018. The revised thresholds generally took effect on January 1, 2015. For   additional discussion of capital adequacy requirements, we refer you to the Capital portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report and to Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.  In addition to these regulatory capital requirements, PNC is subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule, annual capital stress testing requirements and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, as well as the annual and mid-year Dodd-Frank capital stress testing (DFAST) requirements of the Federal Reserve and the OCC. As part of the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital adequacy of BHCs, including PNC, that have $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. This capital adequacy assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted by each participating BHC to the Federal Reserve that describes the company’s planned capital actions during the nine quarter review period, as well as the results of stress tests conducted by both the company and the Federal Reserve under different hypothetical macro-economic scenarios, including a supervisory adverse and a severely adverse scenario provided by the Federal Reserve. In evaluating a BHC’s capital plan, the Federal Reserve considers a number of qualitative factors. In assessing these qualitative factors, which have become increasingly important in the CCAR process in recent years, the Federal Reserve considers whether the BHC’s capital adequacy processes are supported by strong foundational risk management, effective loss and capital estimation methodologies, a sufficient capital adequacy assessment process, comprehensive capital policies and capital planning processes, robust internal controls, and effective governance. From a quantitative perspective, the Federal Reserve considers whether under different hypothetical macro-economic scenarios, including the supervisory severely adverse scenario, the company would be able to maintain throughout each quarter of the nine quarter planning horizon, even if it maintained its base case planned capital actions, (i) a projected pro forma Basel I Tier 1 common capital ratio above 5%, and (ii) regulatory risk-based and leverage capital ratios that exceed the minimums that are, or would then be, in effect for the company, taking into account the Basel III capital rules adopted in July 2013 and any applicable phase-in periods. In addition, the Federal Reserve evaluates a company’s projected path towards compliance with the Basel III regulatory capital framework on a fully implemented basis. After completing its review, the Federal Reserve may object or not object to the BHC’s proposed capital actions, such as plans to pay or increase common stock dividends, reinstate or increase common stock repurchase programs, or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments. In connection with the 2015 CCAR exercise, PNC filed its capital plan and stress testing results using financial data as of September 30, 2014 with the Federal Reserve on January 5, 2015. PNC expects to receive the Federal Reserve’s response (either a         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 7   Table of Contents   non-objection or objection) to the capital plan submitted as part of the 2015 CCAR in March 2015.  As part of the CCAR and annual DFAST processes, both the Federal Reserve and PNC release certain revenue, loss and capital results from their stress testing exercises. For the 2015 exercises, the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to publish its supervisory revenue, loss and capital projections for participating BHCs under the supervisory adverse and severely adverse macro-economic scenarios using the common assumptions concerning capital distributions established by the Federal Reserve in its DFAST regulations (DFAST capital action assumptions), as well as capital ratio information using the firm’s proposed base case capital actions. Within 15 days after the Federal Reserve publishes its DFAST results, PNC also is required to publicly disclose its own estimates of certain capital, revenue and loss information under the same hypothetical supervisory severely adverse macro-economic scenario and applying the DFAST capital action assumptions. Federal Reserve regulations also require that PNC and other large BHCs conduct a separate mid-year stress test using financial data as of March 31 and three company-derived macro-economic scenarios (base, adverse and severely adverse) and publish a summary of the results under the severely adverse scenario. For the 2015 mid-year stress test, PNC must publish its results in the period between July 5 and August 4, 2015.  In October 2014, the Federal Reserve adopted amendments to its capital plan and stress testing rules that will modify the schedule for the CCAR and DFAST processes effective January 1, 2016. Beginning in 2016, covered BHCs are required to submit their annual capital plans and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve by April 5 of each year (rather than by January 5 as currently required). In order to transition to this new schedule, the Federal Reserve’s non-objection to a capital plan submitted in January 2015 will cover capital actions for the five quarter period from the second quarter of 2015 through and including the second quarter of 2016. Under the new schedule that becomes effective in 2016, the Federal Reserve will release its decisions on capital plans and release the results of its supervisory stress test by June 30, approximately three months later than currently. The amendments also shift the schedule for the company-run mid-cycle DFAST exercise, with PNC’s submission date for this exercise shifting to October 5 (from July 5) and the release date for company results moving to October (from July).  Basel III Liquidity Requirements. The Basel III framework adopted by the Basel Committee also includes new short-term liquidity standards (the “Liquidity Coverage Ratio” or “LCR”) and long-term funding standards (the “Net Stable Funding Ratio” or “NSFR”).  In September 2014, the U.S. banking agencies released final rules to implement the LCR. The LCR rules are designed to   ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of cash and high quality, unencumbered liquid assets (HQLA) to meet estimated net liquidity needs in a short-term stress scenario using liquidity inflow and outflow assumptions provided in the rules (net cash outflow). An institution’s LCR is the amount of its HQLA, as defined and calculated in accordance with the haircuts and limitations in the rule, divided by its net cash outflow, with the quotient expressed as a percentage.  Top-tier BHCs (like PNC) that are subject to the advanced approaches for regulatory capital purposes, as well as any subsidiary depository institution of such a company that has $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets (such as PNC Bank), are subject to the full LCR (rather than the less stringent modified LCR) under the final rules that took effect January 1, 2015. However, the minimum required LCR and the requirement to calculate the LCR on a daily basis will be phased-in over a period of years. The minimum LCR PNC and PNC Bank are required to maintain in 2015 is 80% and increases to 90% in 2016 and then to 100% when fully phased-in in 2017. PNC and PNC Bank are required to calculate the LCR on a month-end basis until June 30, 2016, and then on a daily basis beginning on July 1, 2016. If an institution fails to meet the required minimum ratio, it must promptly notify its primary federal banking regulator and may be required to take remedial actions. An institution required to calculate its LCR on a month-end basis must consult with its regulator to determine whether the institution must provide a plan for achieving compliance with the minimum LCR. An institution required to calculate the LCR on a daily basis must promptly provide its regulator with a plan for achieving compliance with the minimum if its LCR is below the minimum for three consecutive business days.  For additional discussion of regulatory liquidity requirements, please refer to the Capital portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section and the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report.  The NSFR is designed to promote a stable maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. The Basel Committee, in October 2014, released the final NSFR framework. Under that framework, the NSFR would take effect as a minimum regulatory standard on January 1, 2018, although the U.S. banking agencies have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR.  Parent Company Liquidity and Dividends. The principal source of our liquidity at the parent company level is dividends from PNC Bank. PNC Bank is subject to various restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to PNC Bancorp, Inc., its direct parent, which is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of PNC. PNC Bank is also subject to federal laws limiting extensions of credit to its parent holding company and non-bank affiliates as discussed in Note 20 Regulatory         8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents   Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Further information on bank level liquidity and parent company liquidity and on certain contractual restrictions is also available in the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section and the Trust Preferred Securities and REIT Preferred Securities portion of the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements And Variable Interest Entities section of Item 7 of this Report, and in Note 12 Capital Securities of a Subsidiary Trust and Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.  Federal Reserve rules provide that a BHC is expected to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support such banks if necessary. Consistent with the “source of strength” policy for subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a BHC generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the corporation’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Further, in providing guidance to the large BHCs participating in the 2015 CCAR, discussed above, the Federal Reserve stated that it expects capital plans submitted in 2015 to reflect conservative dividend payout ratios and net share repurchase programs, and that requests that imply common dividend payout ratios above 30% of projected after-tax net income available to common shareholders will receive particularly close scrutiny.  Additional Powers Under the GLB Act. The GLB Act permits a qualifying BHC to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in, or affiliate with financial companies engaging in, a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a BHC. Permitted affiliates include securities underwriters and dealers, insurance companies and companies engaged in other activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or are determined by the Federal Reserve unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities. We became a financial holding company as of March 13, 2000. In order to be and remain a financial holding company, a BHC and its subsidiary depository institutions must be “well capitalized” and “well managed.” In addition, a financial holding company generally may not engage in a new financial activity, or acquire a company engaged in a new activity, if any of its insured depository institutions received a less than Satisfactory rating at its most recent evaluation under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Among other activities, we currently rely on our status as a financial holding company to conduct merchant banking activities and securities underwriting and dealing activities. As subsidiaries of a financial holding company under the GLB Act, our non-bank subsidiaries are generally allowed to conduct new financial activities, and PNC is generally permitted to acquire non-bank   financial companies that have less than $10 billion in assets, with after-the-fact notice to the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve is the “umbrella” regulator of a financial holding company, with its operating entities, such as its subsidiary broker-dealers, investment advisers, insurance companies and banks, as well as investment companies advised by investment adviser subsidiaries of the financial holding company, also being subject to the jurisdiction of various federal and state “functional” regulators with normal regulatory responsibility for companies in their lines of business.  In addition, the GLB Act permits qualifying national banks to engage in expanded activities through the formation of a “financial subsidiary.” PNC Bank has filed a financial subsidiary certification with the OCC and currently engages in insurance agency activities through financial subsidiaries. PNC Bank may also generally engage through a financial subsidiary in any activity that is determined to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Federal Reserve. Certain activities, however, are impermissible for a financial subsidiary of a national bank, including certain insurance underwriting activities, insurance company investment activities, real estate investment or development, and merchant banking. In order to have a financial subsidiary, a national bank and each of its depository institution affiliates must be and remain “well capitalized” and “well managed.” In addition, a financial subsidiary generally may not engage in a new financial activity, or acquire a company engaged in a new financial activity, if the national bank or any of its insured depository institution affiliates received a less than Satisfactory rating at its most recent evaluation under the CRA.  Volcker Rule. In December 2013, the U.S. banking agencies, SEC and CFTC issued final rules to implement the “Volcker Rule” provisions of Dodd-Frank. The rules prohibit banks and their affiliates (collectively, banking entities) from trading as principal on a short-term basis in securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments, but also includes several important exclusions and exemptions from this prohibition. These exclusions and exemptions, for example, permit banking entities, subject to a variety of conditions and restrictions, to trade as principal for market making, risk-mitigating hedging, and securities underwriting purposes, and to trade in U.S. government and municipal securities. The rules also prohibit banking entities from investing in, sponsoring, and having certain relationships with private funds (such as, for example, private equity or hedge funds) that would be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940 but for the exemptions in sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that act (covered funds). Again there are exemptions from these restrictions which themselves are subject to a variety of conditions. Moreover, the rules prohibit banking entities from engaging in permitted trading         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 9   Table of Contents   or covered fund activities if the activity would involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties, result in a material exposure by the banking entity to a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy, or pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States. Banking entities, like PNC, that have $50 billion or more in total assets are required to establish and maintain an enhanced compliance program designed to ensure that the entity complies with the requirements of the final rule. Based on the level of PNC’s trading assets and liabilities, PNC is not subject to the metrics reporting requirements of the final rules.  The Volcker rule’s prohibitions and restrictions generally become effective on July 21, 2015. In December 2014, the Federal Reserve granted an extension of the conformance period to give all banking entities until July 21, 2016 to conform their investments in, and relationships with, covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (legacy covered funds). Moreover, the Federal Reserve indicated its intent to grant an additional one-year extension of the conformance period for legacy covered funds, which would give banking entities until July 21, 2017 to conform their ownership interests in, and relationships with, legacy covered funds. The Federal Reserve also has the ability to provide up to an additional 5-year conformance period for investments held as of May 1, 2010 in qualifying illiquid funds. For additional information concerning the potential impact of the Volcker Rule on PNC’s operations, please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.  Other Federal Reserve and OCC Regulation and Supervision. The federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective action as deemed appropriate for an insured depository institution and its holding company.  Laws and regulations limit the scope of our permitted activities and investments. National banks (such as PNC Bank) and their operating subsidiaries generally may engage only in activities that are determined by the OCC to be part of or incidental to the business of banking, although a financial subsidiary may engage in a broader range of activities as described above.  Moreover, examination ratings of “3” or lower, lower capital ratios than peer group institutions, regulatory concerns regarding management, controls, assets, operations or other factors, can all potentially result in practical limitations on the ability of a bank or BHC to engage in new activities, grow, acquire new businesses, repurchase its stock or pay dividends, or to continue to conduct existing activities. The OCC, moreover, has been applying certain heightened risk management and governance expectations in its supervision of large national banks, including PNC Bank. In September 2014, the OCC incorporated these expectations into final enforceable guidelines established under section 39 of the   Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act). The guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework at large insured national banks, including PNC Bank. The guidelines describe the appropriate risk management roles and responsibilities of front line units, independent risk management, internal audit, and the board of directors, and provide that a bank should have a comprehensive written statement that articulates its risk appetite and serves as a basis for the framework (a risk appetite statement). PNC Bank is required to be in compliance with the guidelines by May 10, 2015. If the OCC determines that a national bank is not in compliance with these or other guidelines established under section 39 of the FDI Act, the OCC may require the bank to submit a corrective action plan and may initiate enforcement action against the bank if an acceptable plan is not submitted or the bank fails to comply with an approved plan.  The Federal Reserve’s prior approval is required whenever we propose to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or thrift, to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of any bank or thrift, or to merge or consolidate with any other BHC or thrift holding company. The BHC Act enumerates the factors the Federal Reserve must consider when reviewing the merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks, or the acquisition of voting securities of a bank or BHC. These factors include the competitive effects of the proposal in the relevant geographic markets; the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and banks involved in the transaction; the effect of the transaction on the financial stability of the United States; the organizations’ compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served; and the records of performance under the CRA of the insured depository institutions involved in the transaction. In cases involving interstate bank acquisitions, the Federal Reserve also must consider the concentration of deposits nationwide and in certain individual states. Under Dodd-Frank, a BHC also is generally prohibited from merging or consolidating with, or acquiring, another company if the resulting company’s liabilities upon consummation would exceed 10% of the aggregate liabilities of the U.S. financial sector (including the U.S. liabilities of foreign financial companies). OCC prior approval is required for PNC Bank to acquire another insured bank or thrift by merger or to acquire deposits or substantially all of the assets of such institutions. In deciding whether to approve such a transaction, the OCC is required to consider factors similar to those that must be considered by the Federal Reserve. Our ability to grow through acquisitions could be limited by these approval requirements.  At December 31, 2014, PNC Bank had an “Outstanding” rating with respect to CRA.         10 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents  Because of PNC’s ownership interest in BlackRock, BlackRock is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve.  FDIC Insurance and Related Matters. PNC Bank is insured by the FDIC and subject to premium assessments. Regulatory matters could increase the cost of FDIC deposit insurance premiums to an insured bank as FDIC deposit insurance premiums are “risk based.” Therefore, higher fee percentages would be charged to banks that have lower capital ratios or higher risk profiles. These risk profiles take into account, among other things, weaknesses that are found by the primary banking regulator through its examination and supervision of the bank and the bank’s holdings of assets or liabilities classified as higher risk by the FDIC. For example, the amount of brokered deposits (as defined under the FDI Act) held by an insured depository institution can adversely affect the institution’s deposit insurance assessments. A negative evaluation by the FDIC or a bank’s primary federal banking regulator could increase the costs to a bank and result in an aggregate cost of deposit funds higher than that of competing banks in a lower risk category. The methodology for the deposit insurance base calculation currently uses average assets less average tangible equity.  On January 5, 2015, the FDIC issued guidance in the form of frequently asked questions regarding the definition of brokered deposits under the FDI Act, as well as the acceptance and regulatory reporting of brokered deposits by insured depository institutions. Federal banking laws and regulations apply a variety of requirements or restrictions on insured depository institutions with respect to brokered deposits. For example, only a “well capitalized” insured depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval and brokered deposits are generally subject to higher outflow assumptions than other types of deposits for purposes of the LCR.  Resolution Planning. Dodd-Frank requires BHCs that have $50 billion or more in assets, such as PNC, to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that includes, among other things, an analysis of how the company could be resolved in a rapid and orderly fashion if the company were to fail or experience material financial distress. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose restrictions on a covered BHC, including additional capital requirements or limitations on growth, if the agencies jointly determine that the company’s plan is not credible or would not facilitate a rapid and orderly resolution of the company under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or other applicable resolution framework), and additionally could require the company to divest assets or take other actions if the company did not submit an acceptable resolution plan within two years after any such restrictions were imposed. The FDIC also has adopted a rule that requires large insured depository institutions, including PNC Bank, to periodically submit a resolution plan to the FDIC that includes, among other things,   an analysis of how the institution could be resolved under the FDI Act in a manner that protects depositors and limits losses or costs to creditors of the bank in accordance with the FDI Act. Depending on how the agencies conduct their review of the resolution plans submitted by PNC and PNC Bank, these requirements could affect the ways in which PNC structures and conducts its business and result in higher compliance and operating costs. PNC and PNC Bank submitted their 2014 resolution plans under these rules in December 2014.  CFPB Regulation and Supervision. As noted above, Dodd-Frank gives the CFPB authority to examine PNC and PNC Bank for compliance with a broad range of federal consumer financial laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations that relate to credit card, deposit, mortgage, automobile loans and other consumer financial products and services we offer. In addition, Dodd-Frank gives the CFPB broad authority to take corrective action against PNC Bank and PNC as it deems appropriate. The CFPB also has the power to issue regulations and take enforcement actions to prevent and remedy acts and practices relating to consumer financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive, and to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service. These authorities are in addition to the authority the CFPB assumed on July 21, 2011 under existing consumer financial law governing the provision of consumer financial products and services. While the CFPB concentrated much of its initial rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgage related topics required under Dodd-Frank, including ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages, and disclosure requirements, it is also engaged in rulemakings relating to other products and services offered by PNC Bank, including prepaid cards.  In January 2014, new rules issued by the CFPB for mortgage origination and mortgage servicing became effective. The rules require lenders to conduct a reasonable and good faith determination at or before consummation of a residential mortgage loan that the borrower will have a reasonable ability to repay the loan. The regulations also define criteria for making Qualified Mortgages which entitle the lender and any assignee to either a conclusive or rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability to repay rule. The new mortgage servicing rules include new standards for notices to consumers, loss mitigation procedures, and consumer requests for information. Both the origination and servicing rules create new private rights of action for consumers in the event of certain violations. In August 2015, broad new regulations take effect concerning the disclosures we provide to prospective residential mortgage customers. These regulations, among other things, require the provision of new disclosures near the time a prospective borrower submits an application and three days prior to closing of a mortgage loan. In addition to the         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 11   Table of Contents   exercise of its rulemaking authority, the CFPB is continuing its ongoing examination and supervisory activities with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products.  Securities and Derivatives Regulation  Our registered broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC.  Several of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as investment advisers and may provide investment advisory services to clients, other PNC affiliates or related entities, including registered investment companies. Certain of these advisers are registered as investment advisers to private equity funds under rules adopted under Dodd-Frank.  Broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and related regulations. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is the primary self-regulatory organization (SRO) for our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and related regulations. An investment adviser to a registered investment company is also subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and related regulations. Our broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries also are subject to additional regulation by states or local jurisdictions.  Over the past several years, the SEC and other regulatory agencies have increased their focus on the asset management, mutual fund and broker-dealer industries. Congress and the SEC have adopted regulatory reforms and are considering additional reforms that have increased, and are likely to continue to increase, the extent of regulation of the mutual fund and broker-dealer industries and impose additional compliance obligations and costs on our subsidiaries involved with those industries. Under provisions of the federal securities laws applicable to broker-dealers, investment advisers and registered investment companies and their service providers, a determination by a court or regulatory agency that certain violations have occurred at a company or its affiliates can result in fines, restitution, a limitation on permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain types of infractions and violations can also affect a public company in its timing and ability to expeditiously issue new securities into the capital markets. In addition, certain changes in the activities of a broker-dealer require approval from FINRA, and FINRA takes into account a variety of considerations in acting upon applications for such approval, including internal controls, capital levels, management experience and quality, prior enforcement and disciplinary history and supervisory concerns.  Title VII of Dodd-Frank imposes new comprehensive and significant regulations on the activities of financial institutions   that are active in the U.S. over-the-counter derivatives and foreign exchange markets. Title VII was enacted to (i) address systemic risk issues, (ii) bring greater transparency to the derivatives markets, (iii) provide enhanced disclosures and protection to customers, and (iv) promote market integrity. Among other things, Title VII: (i) requires the registration of both “swap dealers” and “major swap participants” with one or both of the CFTC (in the case of non security-based swaps) and the SEC (in the case of security-based swaps); (ii) requires that most standardized swaps be centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house and traded on a centralized exchange or swap execution facility; (iii) subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to capital and margin requirements in excess of historical practice; (iv) subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to comprehensive new recordkeeping and real-time public reporting requirements; (v) subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to new business conduct requirements, including the provision of daily marks to counterparties and disclosing to counterparties (pre-execution) the material risks, material incentives, and any conflicts of interest associated with their swap; and (vi) imposes special duties on swap dealers and major swap participants when transacting a swap with a “special entity” (e.g., governmental agency (federal, state or local) or political subdivision thereof, pension plan or endowment).  Based on the definition of a “swap dealer” under Title VII, PNC Bank registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer on January 31, 2013. As a result, PNC Bank is subject to the regulations and requirements imposed on registered swap dealers, and the CFTC will have a meaningful supervisory role with respect to PNC Bank’s derivatives and foreign exchange businesses. Because of the limited volume of our security-based swap activities, PNC Bank has not registered with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer. The regulations and requirements applicable to swap dealers will collectively impose implementation and ongoing compliance burdens on PNC Bank and will introduce additional legal risks (including as a result of newly applicable antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action).  As originally enacted, the so-called “swap push-out” provisions of Section 716 of Dodd-Frank required an insured depository institution that is a “swaps entity” (defined to include a registered swap dealer like PNC Bank) to cease engaging in certain types of swaps by July 16, 2013, although the institution’s appropriate Federal banking agency could extend this transition period. In 2013, PNC Bank received such an extension of the transition period to July 16, 2015 from its appropriate Federal banking agency. In December 2014, the U.S. Congress significantly narrowed the “push-out” restrictions of Section 716. These amendments generally allow insured depository institutions that are a swaps entity to engage in all types of swaps other than structured finance swaps (defined as a swap that references either an asset-backed security or a group or index primarily comprised of         12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents   asset-backed securities). However, an insured depository institution is permitted to engage in structured finance swaps for hedging or other risk mitigating purposes. An insured depository institution that fails to comply with the restrictions in Section 716 could face restrictions on the institution’s access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window or FDIC deposit insurance or guarantees.  In addition, an investment adviser to private funds or to registered investment companies may be required to register with the CFTC as a commodity pool operator. Registration could impose significant new regulatory compliance burdens. Presently, we expect our subsidiaries that serve as investment advisers to such entities to be eligible for exemptions from registration as a commodity pool operator.  BlackRock has subsidiaries in securities and related businesses subject to SEC, other governmental agencies, state, local and FINRA regulation, and a federally chartered nondepository trust company subsidiary subject to supervision and regulation by the OCC. For additional information about the regulation of BlackRock by these agencies and otherwise, we refer you to the discussion under the “Regulation” section of Item 1 Business in BlackRock’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which may be obtained electronically at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.  Competition  We are subject to intense competition from other regulated banking organizations, as well as various other types of financial institutions and non-bank entities that can offer a number of similar products and services without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions.  In making loans, PNC Bank competes with traditional banking institutions as well as consumer finance companies, leasing companies and other non-bank lenders, and institutional investors including collateralized loan obligation (CLO) managers, hedge funds, mutual fund complexes and private equity firms. Loan pricing, structure and credit standards are extremely important in the current environment as we seek to achieve appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Traditional deposit-taking activities are also subject to pricing pressures and to customer migration as a result of intense competition for deposits and investments.  PNC Bank competes for deposits with:      •    Other commercial banks,      •    Savings banks,      •    Savings and loan associations,      •    Credit unions,      •    Treasury management service companies,      •    Insurance companies, and      •    Issuers of commercial paper and other securities, including mutual funds.  Our various non-bank businesses engaged in investment banking and alternative investment activities compete with:      •    Commercial banks,      •    Investment banking firms,      •    Merchant banks,      •    Insurance companies,      •    Private equity firms, and      •    Other investment vehicles.  In providing asset management services, our businesses compete with:      •    Investment management firms,      •    Large banks and other financial institutions,      •    Brokerage firms,      •    Mutual fund complexes, and      •    Insurance companies.  We include here by reference the additional information regarding competition and factors affecting our competitive position included in the Item 1A Risk Factors section of this Report.  Employees  Employees totaled 53,587 at December 31, 2014. This total includes 49,745 full-time and 3,842 part-time employees, of which 22,216 full-time and 3,274 part-time employees were employed by our Retail Banking business.

Where applicable, we provide GAAP reconciliations for such additional information in materials for that event or in materials for other prior investor presentations or in our annual, quarterly or current reports. When warranted, we will also use our website to expedite public access to time-critical information regarding PNC in advance of distribution of a press release or a filing with the SEC disclosing the same information.  PNC is also required to provide additional public disclosure regarding estimated income, losses and pro forma regulatory capital ratios in March 2015 under a supervisory hypothetical severely adverse economic scenario and in September 2015 under a PNC-developed hypothetical severely adverse economic scenario, as well as information concerning its capital stress testing processes, pursuant to the stress testing regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The timing of these disclosures will change beginning in 2016, as discussed in Regulatory Capital Requirements, Stress Testing and Capital Planning in the Supervision and Regulation section above. PNC also is required to make certain market risk-related public disclosures and certain additional regulatory capital-related disclosures under the regulatory capital rules adopted by the Federal banking agencies. Under these regulations, PNC may be able to satisfy at least a portion of these requirements through postings on its website, and PNC has done so and expects to continue to do so without also providing disclosure of this information through filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also post on our website communications to our shareholders, such as the letter to shareholders that accompanies the Form 10-K mailed to shareholders, and may not file them as exhibits to filings with the SEC when not expressly required.

As a financial services organization, certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make. Thus, we encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business, and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks.  Our success is dependent on our ability to identify, understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability. These risks include, but are not limited to, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, model risk, technology, compliance and legal risk, and strategic and reputation risk. We discuss our principal risk management processes and, in appropriate places, related historical performance in the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Report.  The following are the key risk factors that affect us. Any one or more of these risk factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, in addition to presenting other possible adverse consequences, including those described below. These risk factors and other risks are also discussed further in other sections of this Report.  Difficult economic conditions or volatility in the financial markets would likely have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.  As a financial services company, PNC’s business and overall financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of poor or weak economic conditions, particularly in the United States but also to some extent in the global economy. Recessionary conditions, particularly if severe such as was experienced starting in 2007 and ending in 2009, are likely to have a negative financial impact across the financial services industry, including on PNC. Recessionary economic conditions can lead to turmoil and volatility in financial markets, which can increase the adverse impact on financial institutions such as PNC, with the impact increased to the extent the conditions are more severe. A return to recessionary economic conditions in the United States would likely adversely affect PNC, its business and financial performance, with the impact potentially as or more detrimental than that of the last recession.  The economic recovery from the last recession continued in 2014, but at a slower pace than for recoveries from prior recessions. Although unemployment rates have dropped significantly from the highest levels during the recession, employment is not yet at robust levels. Consumer and business confidence is improving but remains in the cautious zone.  Although Congress and the President have recently been able to reach agreement on budgets and the U.S. government’s debt ceiling, significant long-term issues remain with respect to federal budgetary and spending matters, and it is unclear whether agreements to resolve these issues will be reached, particularly in light of the divided state of the U.S. government. Uncertainty resulting from these issues and recent difficulties in resolving these types of matters could contribute to slower economic growth. Another period where the Congress and the President cannot reach resolution of key federal budgetary and spending matters, leading to events such as actual or threatened government shutdowns or defaults, could adversely affect the U.S. economy. In recent years, a downgrade in the ratings for U.S. Treasury securities by a credit rating agency, an extended government shutdown, and substantial spending cuts through sequestration have resulted from government stalemate on budgetary issues.  The global recession and disruption of the financial markets led to concerns over the solvency of certain European countries, affecting these countries’ capital markets access and in some cases sovereign credit ratings, as well as market perception of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to these countries. These concerns continue even as the global economy is recovering and some previously stressed European economies have experienced at least partial recoveries from their lowpoint during the recession. If measures to address sovereign debt and financial sector problems in Europe are inadequate, they may delay or weaken economic recovery, or result in the exit of one or more member states from the Eurozone or more severe economic and financial conditions. If realized, these risk scenarios could contribute to severe financial market stress or a global recession, likely affecting the economy and capital markets in the United States as well.  Other Risk Factors, presented below, address specific ways in which we may be adversely impacted by economic conditions.  Our business and financial results are subject to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties.  Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from, among other things, extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks, particularly given the high percentage of our assets represented directly or indirectly by loans and the importance of lending to our overall business. We manage credit risk by assessing and monitoring the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and by diversifying our loan portfolio. Many factors impact credit risk.  A borrower’s ability to repay a loan can be adversely affected by several factors, such as business performance, job losses or         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 15   Table of Contents   health issues. A weak or deteriorating economy and changes in the United States or global markets also could adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans. Any decrease in our borrowers’ ability to repay loans would result in higher levels of nonperforming loans, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.  Despite maintaining a diversified loan portfolio, in the ordinary course of business, we may have concentrated credit exposure to a particular person or entity, industry, region or counterparty. Events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, regions or markets, a decrease in the credit quality of a customer base, or an adverse change in the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers could adversely affect us.  Our credit risk may be exacerbated when collateral held by us to secure obligations to us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.  In part due to improvement in economic conditions, as well as actions taken by PNC to manage its portfolio, PNC’s provision for credit losses has declined substantially every year since the end of the recent recession. If we were to once again experience higher levels of provision for credit losses, it could result in lower levels of net income.  Our business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which we have no control and which we may not be able to predict adequately.  As a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve, or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on our business, our profitability and the value of our financial assets and liabilities. For example:      •    Changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities,          which impacts our overall net interest income and profitability.      •    Such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, affect our loss rates on those assets.      •    Such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposit accounts.      •    Such changes can also affect our ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the effectiveness of those hedges in helping to manage such risks.      •    Movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in impairments of mortgage servicing assets or otherwise affect the profitability of such assets.  The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as PNC. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans and that we pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Both due to the impact on rates and by controlling access to direct funding from the Federal Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve’s policies also influence, to a significant extent, our cost of funding. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effects that they may have on our activities and financial results. The current very low interest rate environment has had a negative impact on our ability to increase our net interest income, and its continuation, which is expected at least through mid-year 2015 based on statements by the Chair of the Federal Reserve, could affect consumer and business behavior in ways that are adverse to us in addition to continuing to affect our net interest income. Even once the Federal Reserve begins increasing the interest rates it directly influences, there may be a prolonged period before interest rates return to more historically typical levels.  In addition, monetary and fiscal policy actions by governmental and regulatory decision makers in other countries or in the European Union could have an impact on global interest rates, affecting rates in the United States as well as rates on instruments denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, any of which could have one or more of the potential effects on PNC described above.         16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents  Our business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of changes in the values of financial assets.  As a financial institution, a substantial majority of PNC’s assets and liabilities are financial in nature (items such as loans, securities, servicing rights, deposits and borrowings). Such assets and liabilities will fluctuate in value, often significantly, due to movements in the financial markets or market volatility as well as developments specific to the asset or liability in question.  Credit-based assets and liabilities will fluctuate in value due to changes in the perceived creditworthiness of the borrowers and also due to changes in market interest rates. A lessening of confidence in the creditworthiness of the United States or other governments whose securities we hold could impact the value of those holdings. Changes in loan prepayment speeds, usually based on fluctuations in market interest rates, could adversely impact the value of our mortgage servicing rights. The financial strength of counterparties, with whom we have hedged some of our exposure to certain types of assets, could affect the value of such transactions and assets. Additionally, the underlying value of an asset under lease may decrease due to supply and demand for the asset or the condition of the asset at the end of the lease. This could cause our recorded lease value to decline.  In many cases, PNC marks its assets and liabilities to market on its financial statements, either through its Net income and Retained earnings or through adjustments to Accumulated other comprehensive income on its balance sheet. We may need to record losses in the value of financial assets even where our expectation of realizing the face value of the underlying instrument has not changed.  In addition, asset management revenue is primarily based on a percentage of the value of the assets being managed and thus is impacted by general changes in market valuations. Thus, although we are not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income.  Our business and financial performance are dependent on our ability to attract and retain customers for our products and services, which may be negatively impacted by a lack of consumer and business economic confidence as well as our actions, including our ability to anticipate and satisfy customer demands for products and services.  As a financial institution, our performance is subject to risks associated with the loss of customer confidence and demand. Economic and market developments, in the United States, Europe or elsewhere, may affect consumer and business confidence levels. If customers lose confidence due to a weak or deteriorating economy or uncertainty surrounding the future   of the economy, the demand for our products and services could suffer.  We may also fail to attract or retain customers if we are unable to develop and market products and services that meet evolving customer needs or demands or if we are unable to deliver them effectively and securely to our customers, particularly to the extent that our competitors are able to do so.  News or other publicity that impairs our reputation, or the reputation of our industry generally, also could cause a loss of customers.  If we fail to attract and retain customers, demand for our loans and other financial products and services could decrease and we could experience adverse changes in payment patterns. We could lose interest income from a decline in credit usage and fee income from a decline in product sales, investments and other transactions. PNC’s customers could remove money from checking and savings accounts and other types of deposit accounts in favor of other banks or other types of investment products. Deposits are a low cost source of funds. Therefore, losing deposits could increase our funding costs and reduce our net interest income.  For several years, the United States has been in a very low interest rate environment. This situation has decreased the attractiveness of alternatives to bank checking and savings accounts, which may lack deposit insurance and some of the convenience associated with more traditional banking products and which may no longer be able to offer much higher interest rates. If interest rates were to rise significantly, customers may be less willing to maintain balances in non-interest bearing or low interest bank accounts, which could result in a loss of deposits or a relatively higher cost of funds to PNC. This could also result in a loss of fee income.  In our asset management business, investment performance is an important factor influencing the level of assets that we manage. Poor investment performance could impair revenue and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products. Additionally, the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish. Overall economic conditions may limit the amount that customers are able or willing to invest as well as the value of the assets they do invest. The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products offered by us without regard to the performance of our products. Such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on our assets under management and asset management revenues and earnings.         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 17   Table of Contents  As a regulated financial services firm, we are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and the financial services industry as a whole is subject to significant regulatory reform initiatives in the United States and elsewhere.  PNC is a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company and is subject to numerous governmental regulations involving both its business and organization.  Our businesses are subject to regulation by multiple banking, consumer protection, securities and derivatives regulatory bodies. Applicable laws and regulations restrict our ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from subsidiaries that operate in the banking and securities businesses and impose capital adequacy requirements. PNC’s ability to service its obligations and pay dividends to shareholders is largely dependent on the receipt of dividends and advances from its subsidiaries, primarily PNC Bank. The Federal Reserve requires a BHC to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve could require PNC to commit resources to PNC Bank when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of PNC or its shareholders or creditors.  Applicable laws and regulations restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, mutual fund and other customers, and for the protection of customer information, among other things. We are also subject to laws and regulations designed to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and transactions with persons, companies or foreign governments designated by U.S. authorities.  Starting shortly after the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007, we have faced, and expect to continue to face for the foreseeable future, increased regulation of the financial services industry as a result of initiatives intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions, financial market stability, the transparency and liquidity of financial markets, and consumer and investor protection. We also expect, in many cases, more intense scrutiny from bank, consumer protection and other supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of laws and regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with regulations and other supervisory initiatives will likely increase the company’s costs and reduce its revenue, and may limit the company’s ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. New reforms will also introduce additional legal risk (including as a result of newly applicable antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action) and affect regulatory oversight, applicable capital and liquidity requirements, and residential mortgage and other consumer financial products. The consequences of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions as well as damage to our reputation and businesses.  A number of reform provisions are likely to significantly impact the ways in which banks and BHCs, including PNC, do business. Some of the reform initiatives have led to the formation of new regulatory bodies, such as the CFPB, which has authority to regulate consumer financial products and services sold by banks and non-bank companies and to supervise banks with assets of more than $10 billion and their affiliates for compliance with federal consumer protection laws. Other agencies have significant new powers relevant to PNC, such as the authority now held by the CFTC to regulate non security-based swaps, which, among other things, led PNC Bank to register with the CFTC as a swap dealer in early 2013.  See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report for more information concerning the regulation of PNC and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, including some of the matters discussed in this Risk Factor. Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report also discusses some of the regulation applicable to PNC.  The following describes the key risks associated with some of the initiatives recently undertaken as part of the regulatory reform initiatives affecting the financial services industry, either where pending rules have not yet been finalized or where the impact of new rules has not been substantially realized.      •    In December 2013, the U.S. banking agencies, the SEC and the CFTC adopted regulations implementing the Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-Frank. The Volcker Rule prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in some types of proprietary trading and restricts the ability of banks and their affiliates to sponsor, invest in or have specified other financial relationships with certain types of private funds (referred to as covered funds). We discuss the Volcker Rule in the Supervision and Regulation section included in Item 1 of this Report. PNC discontinued its designated proprietary trading operations several years ago. We currently do not expect the proprietary trading aspects of the final regulations to have a material effect on PNC’s businesses or revenue. Nevertheless, the Volcker Rule regulations place limits and conditions on many types of permissible trading activities, including transactions conducted for purposes of hedging, liquidity management, underwriting or to facilitate customer transactions. These limits and restrictions could cause PNC to forego engaging in hedging or other transactions that it would otherwise undertake in the ordinary course of business and, thus, to some extent, may limit the ability of PNC to most effectively hedge its risks, manage its balance sheet or provide products or services to its customers.      •    In addition, as of December 31, 2014, PNC held interests in private equity and hedge funds that are         18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents          covered funds subject to the Volcker Rule regulations totaling approximately $579 million, including $140 million of sponsored funds. Certain of PNC’s REIT Preferred Securities also were issued by statutory trusts that, as currently structured, are considered covered funds. As of December 31, 2014, PNC also held approximately $1.5 billion of senior debt interests in collateralized loan obligations and certain other investment securities that may be considered ownership interests in covered funds. The unrealized loss associated with these securities was approximately $11 million. In December 2014, the Federal Reserve extended the conformance period for the Volcker Rule, which generally goes into effect on July 21, 2015, to give all banking entities until July 21, 2016 to conform their investments in, and relationships with, covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (legacy covered funds). Moreover, the Federal Reserve also indicated its intent to grant an additional one-year extension of the conformance period for legacy covered funds in order to permit banking entities until July 21, 2017 to conform their ownership interests in, and relationships with, these funds. Substantially all of PNC’s interests in covered funds qualify for the extended conformance period granted for holdings in legacy covered funds. Moreover, certain of PNC’s legacy covered funds may qualify for an additional 5-year conformance period (i.e., until July 21, 2022), subject to Federal Reserve approval. It is likely that at least some of the amounts invested in legacy covered funds will reduce over time in the ordinary course before compliance is required. A forced sale or restructuring of PNC’s investments due to the Volcker Rule would likely result in PNC receiving less value than it would otherwise have received or experiencing other adverse consequences.      •    In February 2014, the Federal Reserve issued final rules establishing new enhanced prudential standards relating to liquidity risk and overall risk management for BHCs (like PNC) that have $50 billion or more in consolidated total assets. The Federal Reserve, however, continues to develop the other enhanced prudential standards that are required under Dodd-Frank for bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated total assets, including the counterparty credit exposure limits and early remediation requirements that were the subject of proposed rules issued in December 2011. Under these proposed rules, PNC could be subject to increasingly stringent actions by the Federal Reserve if its financial condition or risk management deteriorated as reflected by the company’s current or projected post-stress capital levels, compliance with supervisory liquidity and risk management standards and, in some instances, market-based indicators, such as credit default swap spreads. In addition, the          Federal Reserve has indicated that it intends to continue to develop the set of enhanced prudential standards that apply to large bank holding companies in order to further promote the resiliency of such firms and the U.S. financial system. Until the Federal Reserve’s rules and initiatives to establish these enhanced prudential standards are completed, we are unable to fully estimate their impact on PNC, although we expect these initiatives will result in increased compliance costs.      •    In October 2014, six federal agencies (the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, SEC, Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development) adopted final rules to implement the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of Dodd-Frank for asset-backed securitization transactions. The regulations specify when and how securitizers of different types of asset-backed securitizations, including transactions backed by residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, and commercial, credit card and auto loans, must comply with the Dodd-Frank requirement that they retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets being securitized. The final rules also implement the exemptions from these credit risk retention requirements for transactions that are backed by “qualified residential mortgages” or other high-quality commercial mortgage, commercial or automobile loans, each as defined in the final rules. The regulations will take effect on December 24, 2015 with respect to new securitization transactions backed by residential mortgages and on December 24, 2016 with respect to new securitization transactions backed by other types of assets. The final rules are likely to have an impact on PNC both directly as well as indirectly. The extent and magnitude of these impacts is not yet known and will, to some extent, depend on how the markets and market participants (including PNC) adjust to the new rules.  On the indirect impact side, PNC originates loans of a variety of types, including residential and commercial mortgages, credit card, auto, and student, that historically have commonly been securitized, and PNC is also a significant servicer of residential and commercial mortgages held by others, including securitization vehicles. PNC anticipates that the risk retention requirements will impact the market for loans of types that historically have been securitized, potentially affecting the volumes of loans securitized, the types of loan products made available, the terms on which loans are offered, consumer and business demand for loans, and the market for third-party loan servicers. The risk retention rules also could have the effect of slowing the rebound in the securitization markets. One effect of having substantially reduced         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 19   Table of Contents   opportunities to securitize loans would likely be a reduction in the willingness of banks, including PNC, to make loans due to balance sheet management requirements. Any of these potential impacts of the Dodd-Frank risk retention rules could affect the way in which PNC conducts its business, including its product offerings.  Even after new rules are finalized and become effective, it still may take a period of time before the manner in which the rules will be interpreted and administered by the relevant agencies becomes clarified and known. A failure to comply, or to have adequate policies and procedures designed to comply, with these and other regulatory requirements could expose us to damages, fines and regulatory penalties and other regulatory actions, which could be significant, and could also injure our reputation with customers and others with whom we do business.  New capital and liquidity standards will result in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case.  We are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, and discuss these requirements and standards in the Supervision and Regulation section included in Item 1 of this Report.  The regulatory capital requirements applicable to banks and BHCs have undergone, and continue to undergo, significant changes. For example, the final rules adopted by the U.S. banking agencies in July 2013 to implement the new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital established by the Basel Committee known as “Basel III”, as well as to implement certain provisions of Dodd-Frank, fundamentally altered the U.S. regulatory capital requirements for U.S. BHCs and banks. Significant parts of these rules became effective for PNC on January 1, 2014 and on January 1, 2015, although as a result of the staggered effective dates of the rules many provisions are phased-in over a period of years, with the rules generally fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019. The Basel Committee, moreover, continues to consider additional, significant changes to the international capital framework for banking organizations, including modifications that would significantly alter the international frameworks governing the market risk capital requirements for trading positions and the standardized risk weighting approach for credit risk, establish a capital floor for banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches for the risk weighting of assets, modify the treatment of securitization positions, and seek to enhance the transparency and consistency of capital requirements amongst banks and jurisdictions. It is unclear how these or other initiatives by the Basel Committee may be finalized and implemented in the   United States and, thus, we are unable to estimate what potential impact such initiatives may have on PNC.  The U.S. banking agencies also recently have implemented rules that significantly strengthen and alter the framework for liquidity regulation in the United States. In September 2014, the U.S. banking agencies adopted final rules to implement the LCR, a new, short-term quantitative liquidity requirement. These rules require PNC and PNC Bank to maintain an amount of qualifying high-quality liquid assets sufficient to cover the entity’s projected net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period using inflow, outflow and maturity assumptions included in the rule. The LCR rules became effective for PNC and PNC Bank on January 1, 2015, and the minimum required LCR and the requirement to calculate the LCR on a daily basis will be phased-in over a period of years, with the standard being fully implemented on January 1, 2017. In anticipation of the final rules, PNC undertook several actions to prepare for implementation of the LCR. The Federal Reserve’s new liquidity risk management requirements for bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated total assets (like PNC) also became effective on January 1, 2015. The new rules require covered BHCs to, among other things, conduct internal liquidity stress tests over a range of time horizons, maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to meet projected net outflows under the BHC’s 30-day liquidity stress test, and maintain a contingency funding plan that meets detailed requirements.  Additional liquidity standards also are expected to be implemented in the coming years. For example, the Basel Committee, in October 2014, released the final framework for the NSFR standard, which is designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable, long-term funding profile in relation to their asset composition and off-balance sheet activities. Under that framework, the NSFR would take effect as a minimum regulatory standard on January 1, 2018, although the U.S. banking agencies have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR.  The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required could limit PNC’s business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in PNC taking steps to increase its capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or being limited in its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or selling or refraining from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are inconsistent with the assets’ underlying risks. In addition, the new liquidity standards require PNC to maintain holdings of highly liquid short-term investments, thereby reducing PNC’s ability to invest in longer-term or less liquid assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet or interest rate risk management perspective. Moreover, although these new requirements are being phased in over time, U.S. federal         20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents   banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions. Moreover, PNC, as a BHC that is subject to the advanced approaches for regulatory capital purposes, is subject to a higher LCR requirement than other BHCs that have more than $50 billion in total assets but are not subject to the advanced approaches. Until the scope and terms of pending or future rulemakings relating to capital, liquidity, or liability composition are known, the extent to which such rules may apply to PNC and the potential impact of such rules on PNC will remain uncertain.  We depend on information systems, both internally and through third-parties, to conduct our business and could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of, or security breaches affecting, those systems.  As a large financial company, we handle a substantial volume of customer and other financial transactions virtually on a continuous basis. As a result, we rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business and to process, record, and monitor our transactions. In recent years, PNC has increased substantially in size, scope and complexity. We have also seen more customer usage of technological solutions for financial needs and higher expectations of customers and regulators regarding effective and safe systems operation. We expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future. The need to ensure proper functioning of these systems has become more challenging, and the costs involved in that effort are greater than ever.  The risks to these systems result from a variety of factors, both internal and external. In some cases, these factors are largely outside of our control, including the potential for bad acts on the part of hackers, criminals, employees and others. In other cases, our systems could fail to operate as needed due to factors such as design or performance issues, human error, unexpected transaction volumes, or inadequate measures to protect against unauthorized access or transmissions. We are also at risk for the impact of natural or other disasters, terrorism, international hostilities and the like on our systems or for the effect of outages or other failures involving power or communications systems operated by others. In addition, we face a variety of types of cyber attacks, some of which are discussed in more detail below. Cyber attacks often include efforts to disrupt our ability to provide services or to gain access to confidential company and customer information.  We rely on other companies for the provision of a broad range of products and services. Many of these products and services include information systems themselves or involve the use of such systems in connection with providing the products or services. In some cases, these other companies provide the infrastructure that supports electronic communications. These   other companies are generally subject to many of the same risks we face with respect to our systems. To the extent we rely on these other companies, we could be adversely affected if they are impacted by system failures, cyber attacks or employee misconduct.  All of these types of events, whether resulting from cyber attacks or other internal or external sources, expose customer and other confidential information to security risks. They also could disrupt our ability to use our accounting, deposit, loan and other systems and could cause errors in transactions with customers, vendors or other counterparties.  In addition, our customers often use their own devices, such as computers, smartphones and tablets, to do business with us. We have limited ability to assure the safety and security of our customers’ transactions with us to the extent they are utilizing their own devices.  We are faced with ongoing efforts by others to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. Some of these involve efforts to enter our systems directly by going through or around our security protections. Others involve the use of schemes such as “phishing” to gain access to identifying customer information, often from customers themselves. Most corporate and commercial transactions are now handled electronically, and our retail customers increasingly use online access and mobile devices to bank with us. The ability to conduct business with us in this manner depends on the transmission of confidential information, which increases the risk of data security breaches.  Starting in late 2012, there have been several well-publicized series of apparently related denial of service attacks on large financial services companies, including PNC. In a denial of service attack, individuals or organizations flood commercial websites with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal of disrupting the ability of commercial enterprises to process transactions and possibly making their websites unavailable to customers for extended periods of time. The attacks against PNC have resulted in temporary disruptions in customers’ ability to access the corporate website and to perform on-line banking transactions. To date, no customer data has been lost or compromised as a result of these attacks and these efforts have not had a material impact on PNC. We cannot, however, provide assurance that future attacks of this type might not have a greater effect on PNC.  As our customers regularly use PNC-issued credit and debit cards to pay for transactions with retailers and other businesses, there is the risk of data security breaches at those other businesses covering PNC account information. When our customers use PNC-issued cards to make purchases from those businesses, card account information may be provided to the business. If the business’s systems that process or store card account information are subject to a data security breach,         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 21   Table of Contents   holders of our cards who have made purchases from that business may experience fraud on their card accounts. PNC may suffer losses associated with reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent transactions on customers’ card accounts, as well as for other costs related to data security compromise events, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts. In addition, PNC provides card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with payment networks such as Visa and MasterCard. Under these agreements, we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data security breach.  Over the last several years, several large retailers, prominently including Target and Home Depot, disclosed that they had suffered substantial data security breaches compromising millions of card accounts. To date, PNC’s losses and costs related to these breaches have not been material, but other similar events in the future could be more significant to PNC.  There have been other recent publicly announced cyber attacks that were not focused on gaining access to credit card information but instead sought access to a range of other types of confidential information including internal emails and other forms of customer financial information or sought to capture and possibly shutdown systems and devices maintained by target companies. Notable examples include attacks in 2014 on JP Morgan Chase and Sony Pictures and in early 2015 on Anthem. These other attacks have generally not had any financial impact on PNC but demonstrate the risks to confidential information and systems operations potentially posed by cyber attacks.  Methods used by others to attack information systems change frequently (with generally increasing sophistication), often are not recognized until launched against a target, may be supported by foreign governments or other well-financed entities, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world. As a result, we may be unable to address these methods in advance of attacks, including by implementing adequate preventive measures.  We have policies, procedures and systems (including business continuity programs) designed to prevent or limit the effect of possible failures, interruptions or breaches in security of information systems. We design our business continuity and other information and technology risk management programs to manage our capabilities to provide services in the case of an event resulting in material disruptions of business activities affecting our employees, facilities, technology or suppliers. We regularly seek to test the effectiveness of and enhance these policies, procedures and systems.  Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our business continuity planning and our ability to anticipate the timing and nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of   natural and other disasters, terrorist activities, international hostilities and the like could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional governments, including emergency responders, or on the part of other organizations and businesses with which we deal, particularly those on which we depend but have no control over.  In recent years, we have incurred significant expense towards improving the reliability of our systems and their security against external and internal threats. Nonetheless, there remains the risk that an adverse event might occur. If one does occur, we might not be able to remediate the event or its consequences timely or adequately. To the extent that the risk relates to products or services provided by others, we seek to engage in due diligence and monitoring to limit the risk, but here as well we cannot eliminate it. Should an adverse event affecting another company’s systems occur, we may not have indemnification or other protection from the other company sufficient to compensate us or otherwise protect us from the consequences.  The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of any of our information or communications systems, or the systems of other companies on which we rely, could result in a wide variety of adverse consequences to PNC. This risk is greater if the issue is widespread or results in financial losses to our customers. Possible adverse consequences include damage to our reputation or a loss of customer business. We also could face litigation or additional regulatory scrutiny. Litigation or regulatory actions in turn could lead to liability or other sanctions, including fines and penalties or reimbursement of customers adversely affected by a systems problem or security breach. Even if we do not suffer any material adverse consequences as a result of events affecting us directly, successful attacks or systems failures at other financial institutions could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions, including PNC. Also, systems problems, including those resulting from third party attacks, whether at PNC or at our competitors, would likely increase regulatory and customer concerns regarding the functioning, safety and security of such systems generally. In that case, we would expect to incur even higher levels of costs with respect to prevention and mitigation of these risks.  We continually encounter technological change and we could falter in our ability to remain competitive in this arena.  The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. We have been investing in technology and connectivity to automate functions previously performed manually, to facilitate the ability of customers to engage in financial         22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents   transactions, and otherwise to enhance the customer experience with respect to our products and services. On the retail side, this has included developments such as more sophisticated ATMs and expanded access to banking transactions through the internet, smart phones, tablets and other remote devices. These efforts have all been in response to actual and anticipated customer behavior and expectations. Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy customer demands and create efficiencies in our operations. A failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to technology, whether because we fail to anticipate customer expectations or because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not rolled out in a timely manner, may cause us to lose market share or incur additional expense.  There are risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business.  PNC relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. Also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient. See the Model Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Report.  Our asset and liability valuations and the determination of the amount of loss allowances and impairments taken on our assets are highly subjective, and inaccurate estimates could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.  We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Changes in underlying factors or assumptions in any of the areas underlying our estimates could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations. During periods of market disruption, it may be more difficult to value certain of our assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset   classes that were historically in active markets with significant observable data that rapidly become illiquid due to market volatility, a loss in market confidence or other factors. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented market conditions in any particular market could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements.  The determination of the amount of loss allowances and asset impairments varies by asset type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. Although we have policies and procedures in place to determine loss allowance and asset impairments, due to the substantial subjective nature of this area, there can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken or allowances provided for in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances.  Our business and financial results could be impacted materially by adverse results in legal proceedings.  Many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. We have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from our business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies we have acquired). In addition, we are regularly the subject of governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory inquiry. We also are at risk when we have agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, they face, such as in connection with the sale of a business or assets by us. The results of these legal proceedings could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm.  Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies.  We discuss further the unpredictability of legal proceedings and describe certain of our pending legal proceedings in Note 21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 23   Table of Contents  PNC faces legal and regulatory risk arising out of its residential mortgage businesses.  Numerous federal and state governmental, legislative and regulatory authorities are investigating practices in the business of mortgage and home equity loan lending and servicing and in the mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance industries. PNC has received inquiries from governmental, legislative and regulatory authorities on these topics and is responding to these inquiries. These inquiries and investigations could lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, possibly resulting in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, alterations in our business practices and additional expenses and collateral costs. They could also result in reputational harm to PNC, either individually or as part of the overall industry, regardless of the extent to which PNC is penalized.  In addition to governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, PNC, like other companies with residential mortgage and home equity loan origination and servicing operations, faces the risk of class actions, other litigation and claims from: the owners of, investors in, or purchasers of such loans originated or serviced by PNC (or securities backed by such loans), homeowners involved in foreclosure proceedings or various mortgage-related insurance programs, downstream purchasers of homes sold after foreclosure, title insurers, and other potential claimants. Included among these claims are claims from purchasers of mortgage and home equity loans seeking the repurchase of loans where the loans allegedly breached origination covenants and representations and warranties made to the purchasers in the purchase and sale agreements.  At this time PNC cannot predict the ultimate overall cost to or effect upon PNC from governmental, legislative or regulatory actions and private litigation or claims arising out of residential mortgage and home equity loan lending, servicing or reinsurance practices, although such actions, litigation and claims could, individually or in the aggregate, result in significant expense. See Note 21 Legal Proceedings and Note 22 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding federal and state governmental, legislative and regulatory inquiries and investigations and additional information regarding potential repurchase obligations relating to mortgage and home equity loans.  There is a continuing risk of incurring costs related to further remedial and related efforts required by governmental or regulatory authorities and related to repurchase requests arising out of either the foreclosure process or origination issues. Reputational damage arising out of this industry-wide inquiry could also have an adverse effect upon our existing mortgage and home equity loan business and could reduce future business opportunities. Investors in mortgage loans and   other assets that we sell are more likely to seek indemnification from us against losses or otherwise seek to have us share in such losses.  The CFPB has issued new rules for mortgage origination and mortgage servicing. Both the origination and servicing rules create new private rights of action for consumers against lenders and servicers like PNC in the event of certain violations. For additional information concerning the mortgage rules, see Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report.  Additionally, two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) (FHLMC and FNMA) are currently in conservatorship, with its primary regulator acting as a conservator. We cannot predict when or if the conservatorships will end or whether, as a result of legislative or regulatory action, there will be any associated changes to the structure of these GSEs or the housing finance industry more generally, including, but not limited to, changes to the relationship among these GSEs, the government and the private markets. The effects of any such reform on our business and financial results are uncertain.  Our regional concentrations make us at risk to adverse economic conditions in our primary retail banking footprint.  Our retail banking business is primarily concentrated within our retail branch network footprint. Although our other businesses are national in scope, to a lesser extent these other businesses also have a greater presence within these primary geographic markets. Thus, we are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Southeast regions.  We grow our business in part by acquiring other financial services companies or assets from time to time, and these acquisitions present a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.  Acquisitions of other financial services companies, financial assets and related deposits and other liabilities present risks and uncertainties to PNC in addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired.  In general, acquisitions may be substantially more expensive or take longer to complete than anticipated (including unanticipated costs incurred in connection with the integration of the acquired company). Anticipated benefits (including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains, for example resulting from being able to offer product sets to a broader potential customer base) may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events.         24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents  Our ability to achieve anticipated results from acquisitions is often dependent also on the extent of credit losses in the acquired loan portfolios and the extent of deposit attrition, which are, in part, related to the state of economic and financial markets.  Also, litigation and governmental investigations that may be pending at the time of the acquisition or be filed or commenced thereafter, as a result of an acquisition or otherwise, could impact the timing or realization of anticipated benefits to PNC. Note 21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes several legal proceedings related to pre-acquisition activities of companies we have acquired, including National City. Other such legal proceedings may be commenced in the future.  Integration of an acquired company’s business and operations into PNC, including conversion of the acquired company’s different systems and procedures, may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results relating to the acquired company’s or PNC’s existing businesses. In some cases, acquisitions involve our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets, and these situations also present risks and uncertainties in instances where we may be inexperienced in these new areas.  Our ability to analyze the risks presented by prospective acquisitions, as well as our ability to prepare in advance of closing for integration, depends, in part, on the information we can gather with respect to the target, which is more limited than the information we have regarding companies we already own.  As a regulated financial institution, our ability to pursue or complete attractive acquisition opportunities could be negatively impacted by regulatory delays or other regulatory issues. In addition, our ability to make large acquisitions in the future may be negatively impacted by regulatory rules or future regulatory initiatives designed to limit the potential for a financial institution to become “too big to fail.”  We operate in a highly competitive environment, in terms of the products and services we offer and the geographic markets in which we conduct business, as well as in our labor markets where we compete for talented employees. Competition could adversely impact our customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as our credit spreads and product pricing, causing us to lose market share and deposits and revenues.  We are subject to intense competition from various financial institutions as well as from non-bank entities that engage in many similar activities without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions. This competition is described in Item 1 of this Report under “Competition.”   Competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies, in connection with current market conditions or otherwise.  In all, the principal bases for competition are pricing (including the interest rates charged on loans or paid on interest-bearing deposits), product structure, the range of products and services offered, and the quality of customer service (including convenience and responsiveness to customer needs and concerns). The ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry, and it is a critically important component to customer satisfaction as it affects our ability to deliver the right products and services.  Another increasingly competitive factor in the financial services industry is the competition to attract and retain talented employees across many of our business and support areas. This competition leads to increased expenses in many business areas and can also cause us to not pursue certain business opportunities. Limitations on the manner in which regulated financial institutions can compensate their officers and employees may make it more difficult for regulated financial institutions to compete with unregulated financial institutions for talent.  A failure to adequately address the competitive pressures we face could make it harder for us to attract and retain customers across our businesses. On the other hand, meeting these competitive pressures could require us to incur significant additional expense or to accept risk beyond what we would otherwise view as desirable under the circumstances. In addition, in our interest rate sensitive businesses, pressures to increase rates on deposits or decrease rates on loans could reduce our net interest margin with a resulting negative impact on our net interest income.  Our business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, natural or otherwise, by terrorist activities or by international hostilities.  Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and other severe weather conditions, pandemics, dislocations, fires, explosions, and other catastrophic accidents or events), terrorist activities and international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could impact us directly (for example, by causing significant damage to our facilities or preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course), or indirectly as a result of their impact on our borrowers, depositors, other customers, suppliers or other counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region. These types of impacts could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies,         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 25   Table of Contents   bankruptcies or defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.  Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning, and our ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of disasters or terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, particularly those that we depend upon but have no control over.
