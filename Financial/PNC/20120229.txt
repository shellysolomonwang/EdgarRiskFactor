ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS  We are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a financial services organization, certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and are present in the business decisions we make. Thus, we encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business, and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks.  There are risks that are known to exist at the outset of a transaction. For example, every loan transaction presents credit risk (the risk that the borrower may not perform in accordance with contractual terms) and market risk (a     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 11    Table of Contents   potential loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movement in market interest rates or credit spreads), with the nature and extent of these risks principally depending on the financial profile of the borrower and overall economic conditions. We focus on lending that is within the boundaries of our risk framework, and manage these risks by adjusting the terms and structure of the loans we make and through our oversight of the borrower relationship, as well as through management of our deposits and other funding sources.  Risk management is an important part of our business model. The success of our business is dependent on our ability to identify, understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability. These risks include credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, model risk, compliance and legal risk, and strategic and reputation risk. We discuss our principal risk management processes and, in appropriate places, related historical performance in the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Report.  The following are the key risk factors that affect us. Any one or more of these risk factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, in addition to presenting other possible adverse consequences, which are described below. These risk factors and other risks are also discussed further in other sections of this Report.  The possibility of the moderate economic recovery returning to recessionary conditions or of turmoil or volatility in the financial markets would likely have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.  Although the United States economy has shown modest improvement recently, economic conditions continue to pose a risk to financial institutions, including PNC. The economic recovery, although continuing, did so at a slower pace in 2011 than previously anticipated. Job growth has not yet been sufficient to significantly reduce high unemployment in the United States. Consumer and business confidence remains low. There continues to be concern regarding the possibility of a return to recessionary conditions, as well as regarding the possibility of increased turmoil or volatility in financial markets.  The global recession and disruption of the financial markets has led to concerns over capital markets access and the solvency of certain European Union member states, including Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain, and of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by these countries. Certain of the major rating agencies have downgraded the sovereign debt of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to below investment grade. The sovereign debt of Italy and Spain were also downgraded. These ratings downgrades and implementation of European Union and private sector support programs have increased   concerns that other European Union member states could experience similar financial troubles. A failure to adequately address sovereign debt concerns in Europe could hamper economic recovery or contribute to a return to recessionary economic conditions and contribute to severe stress in the financial markets, including in the United States.  On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poors’s Rating Services lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the United States of America from AAA to AA+. It is possible that the downgrade and continued concerns about U.S. fiscal policy and trajectory of the national debt of the U.S. could have severe repercussions on the U.S. and global credit and financial markets, further exacerbate concerns over sovereign debt of other countries and could disrupt economic activity in the U.S. and elsewhere.  Current economic conditions have had an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and may not improve in the near future. We expect these conditions to continue to have an ongoing negative impact on us and a worsening of conditions would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult economic and market conditions on us and on others in the financial services industry.  In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with the current economic and market environment:      •    Investors may have less confidence in the equity markets in general and in financial services industry stocks in particular, which could place downward pressure on PNC’s stock price and resulting market valuation.      •    Economic and market developments, in the United States, Europe or elsewhere, may further affect consumer and business confidence levels and may cause declines in credit usage and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates.      •    The continuation of the current very low interest rate environment, which is expected to continue at least through late 2014 based on statements by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, could affect consumer and business behavior in ways that are adverse to us and could also hamper our ability to increase our net interest income.      •    Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future behaviors.      •    The process we use to estimate losses in our credit exposures requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including with respect to economic conditions and how economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. At any point in time or for any length of time, such losses may no longer be capable of accurate     12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K    Table of Contents          estimation, which may, in turn, adversely impact the reliability of the process for estimating losses and, therefore, the establishment of adequate reserves for those losses.      •    We could suffer decreases in customer desire to do business with us, whether as a result of a decreased demand for loans or other financial products and services or decreased deposits or other investments in accounts with PNC.      •    Competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions, or otherwise.      •    Increased regulation of compensation at financial services companies as part of government efforts to reform the industry may hinder our ability to attract, retain and incentivize well-qualified individuals in key positions.      •    Investors in mortgage loans and other assets that we sell or sold are more likely to seek indemnification from us against losses or otherwise seek to have us share in such losses or to request us to repurchase loans that they believe do not comply with applicable representations and warranties or other contractual provisions.      •    We may be subject to additional fees and taxes as the government seeks to recover some of the costs of its recovery efforts, reduce the national debt or pay for additional government programs, in particular from the financial services industry.  The regulatory environment for the financial services industry is being significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives in the United States and elsewhere, including Dodd-Frank and regulations promulgated to implement it.  The United States and other governments have undertaken major reform of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry, including engaging in new efforts to impose requirements designed to reduce systemic risks and protect consumers and investors from financial abuse. We expect to face further increased regulation of our industry as a result of current and future initiatives intended to provide economic stimulus, financial market stability and enhanced regulation of financial services companies and to enhance the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions and markets. We also expect in many cases more intense scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of laws and regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with regulations and other supervisory initiatives will likely increase our cost and reduce our revenue, and may limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) mandates the most wide-ranging   overhaul of financial industry regulation in decades. Dodd-Frank was signed into law on July 21, 2010. Many parts of the law are now in effect and others are now in the implementation stage, which is likely to continue for several years. The law requires that regulators, some of which are new regulatory bodies created by Dodd-Frank, draft, review and approve more than 300 implementing regulations and conduct numerous studies that are likely to lead to more regulations, a process that, while well underway, is proceeding somewhat slower than originally anticipated, thus extending the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate impact of Dodd-Frank on us. A number of reform provisions are likely to significantly impact the ways in which banks and bank holding companies, including PNC, do business.        •    Newly created regulatory bodies include the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The CFPB has been given authority to regulate consumer financial products and services sold by banks and non-bank companies and to supervise banks with assets of more than $10 billion and their affiliates for compliance with Federal consumer protection laws. The FSOC has been charged with identifying systemic risks, promoting stronger financial regulation and identifying those non-bank companies that are “systemically important” and thus should be subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve. In addition, in extraordinary cases and together with the Federal Reserve, the FSOC could break up financial firms that are deemed to present a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States.        •    Dodd-Frank (through provisions commonly known as the “Volcker Rule”) prohibits banks from engaging in some types of proprietary trading and restricts the ability of banks to sponsor, invest in or have other financial relationships with private equity or hedge funds. In October 2011, four of the five agencies with authority for rulemaking issued proposed rules to implement the Volcker Rule. In January 2012, the fifth agency issued substantially similar proposed rules. The rules set forth a complex and detailed compliance, reporting and monitoring program for large banks, and seek comments on numerous questions. Comments are due in February 2012 on the four agency proposals and later in 2012 on the single agency proposal and a final rule will not be published until some time after those dates. The proposed rules currently require that banking entities have the necessary compliance programs in place by July 2012. Even with the publication of proposed rules, however, there remains considerable uncertainty and we are closely monitoring regulatory developments related to the Volcker Rule. The manner in which the questions posed by the proposed rules are addressed by the agencies will have an     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 13    Table of Contents          important influence on the impact of the final rules on PNC. Although PNC no longer has a designated proprietary trading operation, the proposed rules broadly define what constitutes potentially prohibited “proprietary trading,” thereby making the scope of the statutory and regulatory exemptions for trading activities, including the exemptions for hedging activities and customer trading, all the more important. Until more is known about how the final rules will define “proprietary trading” and the scope of permissible trading activities, it is not possible to determine the impact to PNC of the proprietary trading prohibition. However, any meaningful limitation on PNC’s ability to hedge its risks in the ordinary course or to trade on behalf of customers would likely be adverse to PNC’s business and results of operations. In addition, the proposed rules contain extensive compliance and recordkeeping requirements related to permissible trading activities. Such requirements, if included in a final rule, could increase the costs of hedging or other types of permissible transactions and potentially result in PNC not engaging in certain transactions, or types of transactions, in which we would otherwise engage. With respect to the restrictions on private equity and hedge fund activities, as of December 31, 2011, PNC held interests in such funds likely to be covered totaling approximately $880 million and sponsored three such funds with total invested capital of approximately $441 million. PNC expects that over time it will need to eliminate these investments and cease sponsoring these funds, although it is likely that at least some of these amounts will reduce over time in the ordinary course before compliance is required, and the Volcker Rule also permits extensions of the compliance date under some circumstances. A forced sale of some of these investments due to the Volcker Rule could result in PNC receiving less value than it would otherwise have received. Depending on the provisions of the final rule, it is possible that other structures through which PNC conducts business, such as operating subsidiaries, joint ventures or securitization vehicles, but that are not typically referred to as private equity or hedge funds, could be restricted, with an impact that cannot now be evaluated.        •    Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve to establish enhanced prudential standards governing capital, liquidity, risk management, stress testing and related disclosures, and single-counterparty credit exposure limits for bank holding companies and certain foreign banking organizations with $50 billion or more in consolidated total assets (“covered companies”). Dodd-Frank also requires the Federal Reserve to establish an “early remediation” regime for covered companies under which the Federal Reserve must or          may take increasingly stringent actions against a covered company as its financial health deteriorates. In December 2011, the Federal Reserve requested comment on proposed rules that would implement these requirements for domestic covered companies, including PNC. The proposed enhanced prudential standards would include, among other things, heightened liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements; new standards governing oversight by a covered company’s board of directors and board-level risk committee; and new limits on the aggregate amount of credit exposure a covered company may have to any single customer or counterparty. These proposed rules also would establish an “early remediation” regime for covered companies, under which the Federal Reserve would be required to take increasingly stringent actions against a covered company as its financial condition or risk management deteriorated as reflected by the company’s current or projected post-stress capital levels, compliance with supervisory liquidity and risk management standards and, in some instances, market-based indicators, such as credit default swap spreads. Comments on the proposed rules will be accepted until at least March 31, 2012. Final rules will not be issued until some time after such date, and as such the impact of these rules cannot now be evaluated. Many aspects of the rules, at least as proposed, would not become effective until mid-2013 at the earliest.        •    In addition, the relevant regulatory agencies have proposed rules to implement the Dodd-Frank provisions requiring retention of risk by certain securitization participants through holding interests in the securitization vehicles, but the rules are not yet finalized or effective. As a result, the ultimate impact of these Dodd-Frank provisions on PNC remains unpredictable. That impact on PNC could be direct, by requiring PNC to hold interests in a securitization vehicle or other assets that represent a portion of the credit risk of the assets held by the securitization vehicle, or indirect, by impacting markets in which PNC participates. Since the beginning of the financial crisis, there has been and continues to be substantially less private (that is, non-government backed) securitization activity than had previously been the case. It is unclear at present whether and to what extent the private securitization markets will rebound. In recent years PNC has only engaged in a limited extent in securitization transactions under circumstances where we might expect to be required to retain additional risk on our balance sheet as a result of implementation of these Dodd-Frank provisions. If the market for private securitizations rebounds and PNC decides to increase its participation in that market, we would likely be required under the regulations to retain more risk     14 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K    Table of Contents      •    On the indirect impact side, PNC originates loans of a variety of types, including residential and commercial mortgages, credit card, auto, and student, that historically have commonly been securitized, and PNC is also a significant servicer of residential and commercial mortgages held by others, including securitization vehicles. PNC anticipates that the risk retention requirements will impact the market for loans of types that historically have been securitized, potentially affecting the volumes of loans securitized, the types of loan products made available, the terms on which loans are offered, consumer and business demand for loans, and the need for third-party loan servicers. It should be noted that the risk retention rules themselves could have the effect of slowing the rebound in the securitization markets. One effect of having substantially reduced opportunities to securitize loans would likely be a reduction in the willingness of banks, including PNC, to make loans due to balance sheet management requirements. Any of these potential impacts of the Dodd-Frank risk retention rules could affect the way in which PNC conducts its business, including its product offerings, and could also affect PNC’s revenue and profitability, although, as noted above, not in ways that are currently predictable.        •    Dodd-Frank imposes a new regulatory regime on the U.S. derivatives markets. While some of the provisions related to derivatives came into effect July 16, 2011, most of the new requirements await final regulations from the relevant regulatory agencies for derivatives, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) (in the case of non security-based swaps) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (in the case of security-based swaps). One aspect of the Dodd-Frank regulatory regime for non security-based swaps is that substantial oversight responsibility has been provided to the CFTC, which, as a result, will for the first time have a meaningful supervisory role with respect to some of PNC’s businesses. Although the ultimate impact will depend on the final regulations, PNC expects that its derivatives business will be subject to new substantive requirements, including registration with the CFTC, margin requirements in excess of current market practice, capital requirements specific to this business, real time trade reporting and robust record keeping requirements, business conduct requirements (including daily valuations, disclosure of material risks associated with swaps, and disclosure of PNC’s material incentives and conflicts of interest related to its derivatives business), and mandatory clearing and exchange trading of all standardized swaps designated by the relevant regulatory agencies as          required to be cleared. To the extent PNC enters into act in the “best interests” of the special entity. In addition, the final rules for the registration of municipal advisors (which currently remain at the proposal stage) could result in changes in the nature and extent of our municipal swaps business. The above described requirements will collectively impose implementation and ongoing compliance burdens on PNC and will introduce additional legal risk (including as a result of newly applicable antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action).        •    New provisions under Dodd-Frank concerning the applicability of state consumer protection laws to national banks, such as PNC Bank, N.A., became effective on July 21, 2011. Questions may arise as to whether certain state consumer financial laws that may have previously been preempted by federal law are no longer preempted as a result of the effectiveness of these new provisions. Depending on how such questions are resolved, we may experience an increase in state-level regulation of our retail banking business and additional compliance obligations, revenue impacts and costs. In addition, provisions under Dodd-Frank that also took effect on July 21, 2011 permit state attorneys general to bring civil actions against national banks, such as PNC Bank, N.A., for violations of law, as well as regulations issued by the CFPB.        •    Dodd-Frank requires bank holding companies that have $50 billion or more in assets, such as PNC, to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the FSOC a resolution plan that includes, among other things, an analysis of how the company could be resolved in a rapid and orderly fashion if the company were to fail or experience material financial distress. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose restrictions on PNC, including additional capital requirements or limitations on growth, if the agencies jointly determine that the company’s plan is not credible or would not facilitate a rapid and orderly resolution of PNC under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and additionally could require PNC to divest assets or take other actions if we did not submit an acceptable resolution plan within two years after any such restrictions were imposed. The FDIC also has adopted a rule that requires large insured depository institutions, including PNC Bank, N.A., to periodically submit a resolution plan to the FDIC that includes, among other things, an analysis of how the institution could be resolved under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) in a manner that protects depositors and limits losses or costs to creditors of the bank in accordance with the FDI Act. PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. must file their first plans     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 15    Table of Contents          under these rules by December 31, 2013. Depending resolution plans submitted by PNC and PNC Bank, N.A., it is possible that these requirements could affect the ways in which PNC structures and conducts its business and result in higher compliance and operating costs.        •    Other provisions of Dodd-Frank will affect regulatory oversight, holding company capital requirements, and residential mortgage products.  While much of how the Dodd-Frank and other financial industry reforms will change our current business operations depends on the specific regulatory promulgations and interpretations, many of which have yet to be released or finalized, it is clear that the reforms, both under Dodd-Frank and otherwise, will have a significant effect on our entire industry. Although Dodd-Frank and other reforms will affect a number of the areas in which we do business, it is not clear at this time the full extent of the adjustments that will be required and the extent to which we will be able to adjust our businesses in response to the requirements. Although it is difficult to predict the magnitude and extent of these effects at this stage, we believe compliance with Dodd-Frank and its implementing regulations and other initiatives will continue to negatively impact revenue, at least to some extent, and increase the cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities.  Capital requirements imposed by Dodd-Frank, together with new capital and liquidity standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee), will result in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case.  New and evolving capital standards, both as a result of Dodd-Frank and implementation of new capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee, including the so-called “Basel III” capital accord issued in December 2010, will have a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including PNC. Basel III, among other things, narrows the definition of regulatory capital and establishes higher minimum risk-based capital ratios that, when fully phased-in, will require banking organizations, including PNC, to maintain a minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%. A capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of these levels also is required, which potentially may be supplemented by an additional countercyclical capital buffer. In addition, Basel III introduces an international leverage ratio. The capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee and to be implemented in the United States also increase the capital requirements for specific types of exposures (including sub-investment grade securitization exposures) and requires   that unconsolidated investments in financial entities on how the agencies conduct their review of the a swap with a “special entity” such as any federal agency, state or state agency, city, county, municipality, or other political subdivisions of a state, additional business conduct requirements will be imposed on PNC, including the requirement that PNC have a reasonable basis to believe that the special entity has a qualified representative that undertakes a duty to act in the best interests of the special entity and that is independent of PNC and the requirement that PNC disclose to the special entity the capacity in which PNC is acting in connection with the swap (and if PNC is acting in more than one capacity, the material differences between such capacities). Further, to the extent PNC acts as an advisor to a special entity, PNC will be required to than would otherwise have been the case, and as a result could be required to consolidate certain securitization vehicles on our balance sheet, with currently an uncertain financial impact. (potentially including PNC’s investment in BlackRock), as well as mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets, above certain thresholds be deducted from regulatory capital.  Basel III also includes new short-term liquidity standards (the Liquidity Coverage Ratio) and long-term funding standards (the Net Stable Funding Ratio). The Liquidity Coverage Ratio, which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2015, is designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain an adequate level of cash, or assets that can readily be converted to cash, to meet potential short-term liquidity needs. The Net Stable Funding Ratio, which is scheduled to take effect by January 1, 2018, is designed to promote a stable maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon.  In November 2011, the Basel Committee also adopted a framework that would require globally systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”) to maintain additional Tier 1 common capital ranging between 1.0% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, with the actual required amount varying based on the firm’s global systemic importance as determined using five criteria (size, interconnectedness, lack of substitutability, cross-jurisdictional activity, and complexity). Regulatory authorities have not yet definitively determined the banking organizations that would be subject to a surcharge as a G-SIB although, based on the criteria included in the Basel Committee’s framework, PNC believes that it is unlikely to be deemed a G-SIB. Dodd-Frank directs the Federal Reserve to establish heightened risk-based and leverage capital requirements and liquidity requirements for bank holding companies, like PNC, that have $50 billion or more in assets. The Federal Reserve has proposed to rely primarily on the forthcoming Basel III capital and liquidity rules, as well as certain existing or proposed rules, to fulfill this directive. However, the Federal Reserve has stated that it is still considering whether to impose an additional capital surcharge on bank holding companies that have $50 billion or more in consolidated total assets, but that are not subject to a G-SIB surcharge.     16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K    Table of Contents  Because implementation of the new Basel III capital and liquidity standards, as well as any additional heightened capital or liquidity standards that may be established by the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act, remain subject to rule making in the U.S. and, in many cases, to extended observation and phase-in periods, the full effect of these standards on PNC’s regulatory capital is uncertain at this time. However, pursuant to the “Collins Amendment” to Dodd-Frank, the U.S. federal banking agencies recently adopted a final rule that requires the phase-out of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 regulatory capital, and defined the risk-based capital standards generally applicable to all banking organizations. As of December 31, 2011, PNC had $2.4 billion of trust preferred securities included in Tier 1 capital which, under these rules and to the extent the securities remain outstanding, will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital over time.  In December 2011, the Federal banking agencies also requested comment on proposed rules that would replace the use of credit ratings as a means of determining regulatory capital requirements under the agencies’ market risk capital rule with alternative methodologies, as required by Section 939A of Dodd-Frank. The agencies have indicated that the credit rating alternatives developed through this rulemaking likely would be incorporated into the agencies’ general risk-based capital rules affecting so-called “banking book” exposures. Accordingly, the credit rating alternatives that are adopted by the agencies through the market risk rulemaking are likely to significantly influence the amount of capital that PNC and other U.S. banking organizations must hold with respect to a wide range of exposures including sovereign, state, municipal, corporate, financial institution and securitization exposures, although the extent to which the final rules will ultimately lead to increased or decreased capital requirements for specific types of exposures or for PNC in the aggregate is not known at this time.  The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required could limit PNC’s business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in PNC taking steps to increase its capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or being limited in its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or selling or refraining from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are inconsistent with the assets’ underlying risks. In addition, the new liquidity standards could require PNC to increase its holdings of highly liquid short-term investments, thereby reducing PNC’s ability to invest in longer-term assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. Moreover, although these new requirements are being phased in over time, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions.  Our lending and servicing businesses and the value of the loans and debt securities we hold may be adversely affected by economic conditions, including a reversal or slowing of the current moderate recovery. Downward valuation of debt securities could also negatively impact our capital position.  Given the high percentage of our assets represented directly or indirectly by loans, and the importance of lending to our overall business, weak economic conditions are likely to have a negative impact on our business and our results of operations. This could adversely impact loan utilization rates as well as delinquencies, defaults and customer ability to meet obligations under the loans. This is particularly the case during the period in which the aftermath of recessionary conditions continues and the positive effects of economic recovery appear to be slow to materialize and unevenly spread among our customers.  Further, weak economic conditions would likely have a negative impact on our business, our ability to serve our customers, and our results of operations. Such conditions are  likely to lead to increases in the number of borrowers who become delinquent or default or otherwise demonstrate a decreased ability to meet their obligations under their loans. This would result in higher levels of non-performing loans, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The value to us of other assets such as investment securities, most of which are debt securities or other financial instruments supported by loans, similarly would be negatively impacted by widespread decreases in credit quality resulting from a weakening of the economy.  We have historically not considered government insured or guaranteed loans to be higher risk loans as defaults are materially mitigated by payments of insurance or guaranteed amounts for approved claims by the applicable government agency. While the level of claim denials by government agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has historically been low, if financial conditions prompt government agencies to deny or curtail an increasing number of these claims, we could face additional losses in our lending business. In addition, in the event that submitted claims are denied or curtailed as a result of our failure as a servicer of the loan to adhere to applicable agency servicing guidelines, we will be required to remit the difference between the claims proceeds that should have been received and the claim amounts actually received to the holder of the loan.  A failure to sustain reduced amounts of the provision for credit losses, which has benefitted results of operations in recent periods, could result in decreases in net income.  As was typical in the banking industry, the economic downturn that started in 2007 resulted in PNC experiencing     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 17    Table of Contents   high levels of provision for credit losses. In the quarters from the fourth quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of 2010, PNC’s provision for credit losses ranged from $751 million to $1.1 billion in each quarter. Subsequently, in part due to improvement in economic conditions, as well as actions taken by PNC to manage its portfolio, PNC’s provision for credit losses has declined substantially, reaching a level of $190 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This decline in provision for credit losses has been a major contributor to PNC’s ability to maintain and grow its net income during this period. If PNC’s provision for credit losses were to rise back towards levels experienced during the height of the economic downturn, it would have an adverse effect on PNC’s net income and could result in lower levels of net income than PNC has reported in recent periods.  Our regional concentrations make us particularly at risk to adverse economic conditions in our primary retail banking footprint.  Although many of our businesses are national in scope, our retail banking business is concentrated within our retail branch network footprint, located principally in our primary geographic markets. Following the expected acquisition of RBC Bank (USA), this footprint will expand to include North Carolina, South Carolina, and Alabama. Thus, we are or in the future may be particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Southeast regions.  Our business and performance are vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.  As most of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature, we tend to be particularly sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets, such as that experienced during the recent financial crisis, can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed above, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to us. Financial market volatility also can have some of the following adverse effects on PNC and our business and financial performance:      •    It can affect the value or liquidity of our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments.      •    It can affect the value of servicing rights, including those we carry at fair value.      •    It can affect our ability to access capital markets to raise funds necessary to support our businesses and maintain our overall liquidity position. Inability to access capital markets as needed, or at cost effective rates, could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.      •    It can affect the value of the assets that we manage or otherwise administer for others or the assets for which we provide processing and information          services. Although we are not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for our services.      •    It can affect the required funding of our pension obligations to the extent that the value of the assets supporting those obligations drops below minimum levels.      •    In general, it can impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which we engage.  Volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and is likely  to continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets.  Our business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which we have no control and which we may not be able to predict adequately.  As a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on our business, our profitability and the value of our financial assets and liabilities. For example:      •    Changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities, which impacts our overall net interest income and profitability.      •    Such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, affect our loss rates on those assets.      •    Such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposit accounts.      •    Such changes can also affect our ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or increase the risk associated with such hedges.      •    Movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in impairments of mortgage servicing assets or otherwise affect the profitability of such assets.  The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant     18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K    Table of Contents   impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as PNC. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans and that we pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Both due to the impact on rates and by controlling access to direct funding from the Federal Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve’s policies also influence, to a significant extent, our cost of funding. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on our activities and financial results.  PNC faces increased risk arising out of its residential mortgage businesses.  Numerous federal and state governmental, legislative and regulatory authorities are investigating practices in the mortgage lending, servicing and mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance industries. PNC has received inquiries from governmental, legislative and regulatory authorities on these topics and is responding to these inquiries. These inquiries and investigations could lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, possibly resulting in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, alterations in our business practices and additional expenses and collateral costs. See Note 22 Legal Proceedings in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding federal and state governmental, legislative and regulatory inquiries and investigations, including the consent orders entered into by PNC and PNC Bank, N. A. with the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively.  In addition to governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, PNC, like other companies with residential mortgage origination and servicing operations, faces the risk of class actions, other litigation and claims from the owners of, investors in or purchasers of mortgages originated or serviced by PNC (or securities backed by such mortgages); homeowners involved in foreclosure proceedings or various mortgage-related insurance programs; downstream purchasers of homes sold after foreclosure; title insurers; and other potential claimants. At this time PNC cannot predict the ultimate overall cost to or effect upon PNC from governmental, legislative or regulatory actions and private litigation or claims arising out of residential mortgage lending, servicing or reinsurance practices, although such actions, litigation and claims could, individually or in the aggregate, result in significant expense.  The issues described above may affect the value of our ownership interests, direct or indirect, in property subject to foreclosure. In addition, possible delays in the schedule for   processing foreclosures may result in an increase in nonperforming loans, additional servicing costs and possible demands for contractual fees or penalties under servicing agreements.  There is also an increased risk of incurring costs related to further remedial and related efforts required by the consent orders and related to repurchase requests arising out of either the foreclosure process or origination issues. Reputational damage arising out of this industry-wide inquiry could also have an adverse effect upon our existing mortgage business and could reduce future business opportunities.  One or more of the foregoing could adversely affect PNC’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  We grow our business in part by acquiring other financial services companies from time to time, and these acquisitions present a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.  Acquisitions of other financial services companies, financial services assets and related deposits and other liabilities present risks and uncertainties to PNC in addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired.  In general, acquisitions may be substantially more expensive to complete than anticipated (including unanticipated costs incurred in connection with the integration of the acquired company). Anticipated benefits (including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains) may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events.  Our ability to achieve anticipated results from acquisitions is  often dependent also on the extent of credit losses in the acquired loan portfolios and the extent of deposit attrition, which are, in part, related to the state of economic and financial markets. Also, litigation and governmental investigations that may be filed or commenced, as a result of an acquisition or otherwise, could impact the timing or realization of anticipated benefits to PNC.  Integration of an acquired company’s business and operations into PNC, including conversion of the acquired company’s different systems and procedures, may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results relating to the acquired company’s or PNC’s existing businesses. In some cases, acquisitions involve our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets, and these situations also present risks and uncertainties in instances where we may be inexperienced in these new areas.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 19    Table of Contents  Our ability to analyze the risks presented by prospective acquisitions, as well as our ability to prepare in advance of closing for integration, depends, in part, on the information we can gather with respect to the target, which is more limited than the information we have regarding companies we already own.  Our pending acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) presents many of the risks and uncertainties related to acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing described above.  As a regulated financial institution, our ability to pursue or complete attractive acquisition opportunities could be negatively impacted by regulatory delays or other regulatory issues. In addition, legal and regulatory or other governmental proceedings, claims, investigations or inquiries relating to pre-acquisition business and activities of acquired companies may result in future monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including damages, fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to PNC. The processes of integrating acquired businesses, as well as the deconsolidation of divested businesses, also pose many additional possible risks which could result in increased costs, liability or other adverse consequences to PNC. Note 22 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes several legal proceedings related to pre-acquisition activities of companies we have acquired, including National City. Other such legal proceedings may be commenced in the future.  The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized  upon or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.  We operate in a highly competitive environment, in terms of the products and services we offer and the geographic markets in which we conduct business, as well as in our labor markets where we compete for talented employees. Competition could adversely impact our customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as our credit spreads and product pricing, causing us to lose market share and deposits and revenues.  We are subject to intense competition from various financial institutions as well as from non-bank entities that engage in many similar activities without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions. This competition is described in Item 1 of this Report under “Competition.”  In all, the principal bases for competition are pricing (including the interest rates charged on loans or paid on interest-bearing deposits), product structure, the range of products and services offered, and the quality of customer service (including convenience and responsiveness to customer needs and concerns). The ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry, and it is a critically important component to customer satisfaction as it affects our ability to deliver the right products and services.  Another increasingly competitive factor in the financial services industry is the competition to attract and retain talented employees across many of our business and support areas. This competition leads to increased expenses in many business areas and can also cause us to not pursue certain business opportunities.  A failure to adequately address the competitive pressures we face could make it harder for us to attract and retain customers across our businesses. On the other hand, meeting these competitive pressures could require us to incur significant additional expense or to accept risk beyond what we would otherwise view as desirable under the circumstances. In addition, in our interest rate sensitive businesses, pressures to increase rates on deposits or decrease rates on loans could reduce our net interest margin with a resulting negative impact on our net interest income.  The performance of our asset management businesses may be adversely impacted by overall economic and market conditions as well as the relative performance of our products compared with the offerings by competitors.  Asset management revenue is primarily based on a percentage of the value of the assets and thus is impacted by general changes in market valuations, customer preferences and needs. In addition, investment performance is an important factor influencing the level of assets. Poor investment performance could impair revenue and growth as existing clients might  withdraw funds in favor of better performing products. Additionally, the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish. Overall economic conditions may limit the amount that customers are able or willing to invest as well as the value of the assets they do invest.  The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products offered by us without regard to the performance of our products. Such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such     20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K    Table of Contents   products and have a material adverse impact on our assets under management and asset management revenues and earnings.  As a regulated financial services firm, we are subject to numerous governmental regulations and to comprehensive examination and supervision by regulators, which affect our business as well as our competitive position.  PNC is a bank holding company and a financial holding company and is subject to numerous governmental regulations involving both its business and organization.  Our businesses are subject to regulation by multiple bank regulatory bodies as well as multiple securities industry regulators. Applicable laws and regulations restrict our ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from subsidiaries  that operate in the banking and securities businesses and impose capital adequacy requirements. PNC’s ability to service its obligations is dependent on the receipt of dividends and advances from its subsidiaries. Applicable laws and regulations also restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, mutual fund and other customers, and for the protection of customer information, among other things. We are also subject to laws and regulations designed to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and transactions with persons, companies or foreign governments designated by U.S. authorities. The consequences of noncompliance can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions as well as damage to our reputation and businesses.  In addition, we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by banking and other regulatory bodies. Examination reports and ratings (which often are not publicly available) and other aspects of this supervisory framework can materially impact the conduct, growth, and profitability of our businesses.  Due to the current economic environment and issues facing the financial services industry, we anticipate that there will be new legislative and regulatory initiatives over the next several years, including many focused specifically on banking and other financial services in which we are engaged. These initiatives will be in addition to the actions already taken by Congress and the regulators, through enactment of the Credit CARD Act, the SAFE Act, and Dodd-Frank, as well as changes to the regulations implementing the Real Estate  Settlement Procedures Act, the Federal Truth in Lending Act, and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. Legislative and regulatory initiatives have had and are likely to continue to have an impact on the conduct of our business. This impact could include rules and regulations that affect the nature and profitability of our business activities, how we use our capital, how we compensate and incent our employees, the type and amount of instruments we hold for liquidity purposes, and other matters potentially having a negative effect on our overall business results and prospects.  Under the regulations of the Federal Reserve, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. As a result, the Federal Reserve could require PNC to commit resources to PNC Bank, N.A. when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of PNC or its shareholders or creditors.  Our ability to pay dividends to shareholders is largely dependent on dividends from our operating subsidiaries, principally PNC Bank, N.A. Banks are subject to regulation on the amount and circumstances of dividends they can pay to their holding companies.  We discuss these and other regulatory issues applicable to PNC, including some particular areas of current regulatory focus or concern, in the Supervision and Regulation section included in Item 1 of this Report and in Note 21 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and here by reference.  A failure to comply, or to have adequate policies and procedures designed to comply, with regulatory requirements could expose us to damages, fines and regulatory penalties and other regulatory actions, which could be significant, and could also injure our reputation with customers and others with whom we do business.  We must comply with generally accepted accounting principles established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, accounting, disclosure and other rules set forth by the SEC, income tax and other regulations established by the US Treasury and state and local taxing authorities, and revenue rulings and other guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service, which affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in accounting standards, or interpretations of those standards, can impact our revenue recognition and expense policies and affect our estimation methods used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. Changes in income tax regulations, revenue rulings, revenue procedures, and other guidance can impact our tax liability and alter the timing of cash flows associated with tax deductions and payments. New guidance often dictates how changes to standards and regulations are to be presented in our consolidated financial statements, as either an adjustment to beginning retained earnings for the period or as income or expense in current  period earnings. In some cases, changes may be applied to previously reported disclosures.  The determination of the amount of loss allowances and impairments taken on our assets is highly subjective, and inaccurate estimates could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.  The determination of the amount of loss allowances and asset impairments varies by asset type and is based upon our     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 21    Table of Contents   periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. Although we have policies and procedures in place to determine loss allowance and asset impairments, due to the substantial subjective nature of this area, there can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken or allowances provided for in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances.  Our asset valuation may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and this, along with market factors such as volatility in one or more markets, could result in changes to asset valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.  We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party sources, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques utilizing assumptions such as credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying factors or assumptions in any of the areas underlying our estimates could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.  During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be more difficult to value certain of our assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were historically in active markets with significant observable data that rapidly become illiquid due to market volatility, a loss in market confidence or other factors. In such cases, valuations in certain asset classes may require more subjectivity and management judgment; valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented market conditions in any particular market (e.g. credit, equity, fixed income, foreign exchange) could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements, and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly.  We are subject to operational risk.  Like all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. Operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. We are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business. Although we seek to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls which we review and  update, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or foregone business opportunities.  We continually encounter technological change and we could falter in our ability to remain competitive in this arena.  The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy customer demands and create efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allow us to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers.  Our information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security.  We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to our accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect our customer relationships. While we have policies and  procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently remediated.  There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions, including through the use of social engineering schemes such as “phishing.” In addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change     22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K    Table of Contents   frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The ability of our customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches.  Although to date efforts to breach our data security have not had a material impact on PNC, the occurrence of any such failure, interruption or security breach of our systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to our customers, could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and financial liability.  Our business and financial results could be impacted materially by adverse results in legal proceedings.  Many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. We have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from our business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies we have acquired). In addition, we are regularly the subject of governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory inquiry. We also are at risk when we have agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, they face, such as in connection with the sale of a business or assets by us. The results of these legal proceedings could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm.  Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies.  We discuss further the unpredictability of legal proceedings and describe some of our pending legal proceedings in Note 22 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.  Our business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, by terrorist activities or by international hostilities.  Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters, terrorist activities and international hostilities can be   predicted. However, these occurrences could impact us directly (for example, by causing significant damage to our facilities or preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course), or indirectly as a result of their impact on our borrowers, depositors, other customers, suppliers or other counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region. These types of impacts could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.  Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning, and our ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of disasters or terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, particularly those that we depend upon but have no control over.
