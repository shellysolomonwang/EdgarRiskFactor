Item 1A Risk Factors for additional information.  BANKING REGULATION AND SUPERVISION  Regulatory Capital Requirements, Stress Testing and Capital Planning. PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. These requirements are currently the subject of significant changes as a result of the rules adopted by the U.S. banking agencies in July 2013 to implement the new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital established by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (Basel Committee) known as “Basel III,” as well as to implement certain provisions of Dodd-Frank. The rules adopted in July 2013 generally have three fundamental parts.  The first part, referred to as the Basel III capital rule, among other things, narrows the definition of regulatory capital, requires banking organizations with $15 billion or more in assets (including PNC) to phase-out trust preferred securities from Tier 1 regulatory capital, establishes a new Tier 1   common capital requirement for banking organizations, and revises the capital levels at which PNC and the PNC Bank, N.A. would be subject to prompt corrective action. These rules also require that significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions (as defined in the rule), as well as mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets, be deducted from Tier 1 common regulatory capital to the extent such items individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the organization’s adjusted Tier 1 common capital. The Basel III capital rule also significantly limits the extent to which minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries (including minority interests in the form of REIT preferred securities) may be included in regulatory capital. In addition, for banking organizations, like PNC, that are subject to the advanced approaches (described below), the rule includes other comprehensive income related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans as a component of Tier 1 common capital. The Basel III capital rule became effective on January 1, 2014, for PNC and PNC Bank, N.A., although many provisions are phased-in over a period of years, with the rules generally fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019.  The second part of the rules adopted in July 2013 is referred to as the advanced approaches and materially revises the framework for the risk-weighting of assets under Basel II. The Basel II framework, which was adopted by the Basel Committee in 2004, seeks to provide more risk-sensitive regulatory capital calculations and promote enhanced risk management practices among large, internationally active banking organizations. The advanced approaches modifications adopted by the U.S. banking agencies became effective on January 1, 2014, and generally apply to banking organizations that have $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or that have $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure. Prior to fully implementing the advanced approaches to calculate risk-weighted assets, PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. must successfully complete a “parallel run” qualification phase. PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. entered this parallel run qualification phase on January 1, 2013. This phase must last at least four consecutive quarters, although, consistent with the experience of other U.S. banks, we currently anticipate a multi-year parallel run period.  The third major part of the rules adopted in July 2013 is referred to as the standardized approach and materially revises the framework for the risk-weighting of assets under Basel I. The standardized approach, for example, establishes a new framework for the risk-weighting of securitization and non-U.S. sovereign exposures, and increases the risk-weights on certain types of assets including high-volatility commercial real estate and past due corporate and retail exposures. The standardized approach will become effective on January 1, 2015.  The risk-based capital and leverage rules that the federal banking regulators have adopted require the capital-to-assets ratios of banking organizations, including PNC and PNC         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 5   Table of Contents   Bank, N.A., to meet certain minimum standards. The Basel III rule generally divides capital into three components: Tier 1 common capital, additional Tier 1 capital (which, together, with Tier 1 common capital comprises Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 common is generally common stock, retained earnings, qualifying minority interest and, for advanced approaches banking organizations, accumulated other comprehensive income, less the deductions required to be made from Tier 1 common equity. Additional Tier 1 generally includes, among other things, perpetual preferred stock and qualifying minority interests, less the deductions required to be made from additional Tier 1. Tier 2 capital generally comprises qualifying subordinated debt. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, less the deductions required from total capital. For additional information regarding the differences between Basel III and Basel I Tier 1 common capital, see the Funding and Capital Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report.  Under the capital rules, a banking organization’s risk-based capital ratios are calculated by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet financial instruments into risk-weighted categories (with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk), which are used to determine the amount of a banking organization’s total risk-weighted assets (RWAs). Under the Basel I framework and the standardized approach, the nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages that are set forth in the rules that increase as the perceived credit risk of the relevant asset increases.  The Basel I regulatory capital ratios of PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. as of December 31, 2013 exceeded the applicable minimum levels in effect for 2013. For additional information regarding the Basel I capital ratios of PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. as of December 31, 2013, as well as the levels necessary to exceed the regulatory minimums or be considered “well capitalized”, see the Funding and Capital Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report. When fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III capital rule will require that banking organizations maintain a minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%. Moreover, when fully phased-in, the rule will require banking organizations to maintain a Tier 1 common ratio of at least 7.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of at least 10.5% to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including common stock dividends and share repurchases) and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments. For banking organizations that are subject to the advanced approaches, these higher capital conservation buffer levels above the regulatory minimums could be supplemented by a countercyclical capital buffer of up to an additional 2.5% during periods of excessive credit growth, although this buffer is initially set at zero in the United States.  The regulatory capital framework adopted by the federal banking regulators also requires that banking organizations maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets, referred to as the leverage ratio. Under both Basel I and Basel III, banking organizations generally are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 4.0%. The Basel I rules in effect during 2013, however, also permitted a banking organization to meet its minimum leverage requirement if it had a leverage ratio of 3% and was rated Composite 1 in its most recent report of examination, subject to appropriate federal banking guidelines. As of December 31, 2013, the leverage ratios of PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. were above the required minimum level. Under the Basel III capital rule, banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches (such as PNC and PNC Bank, N.A.) also will be subject to a new minimum 3.0% supplementary leverage ratio that becomes effective on January 1, 2018, with public reporting of the ratio beginning in 2015. Unlike the existing leverage ratio, the denominator of the supplementary leverage ratio takes into account certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts. The Basel Committee in January 2014 issued revisions to the supplementary leverage requirements of the Basel III framework, although it is not clear at this time to what extent these revisions will be incorporated by the U.S. banking agencies into the U.S. capital rules. In August 2013, the U.S. banking agencies requested comment on a proposed rule that would raise the supplemental leverage ratio for U.S. bank holding companies that have $700 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 trillion or more in assets under custody and for the insured depository institution subsidiaries of these bank holding companies. Based on the asset and custody thresholds included in the proposed rule, PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. would not be subject to this higher proposed supplemental leverage ratio.  As a result of the staggered effective dates of the final U.S. capital rules issued in July 2013, as well as the fact that PNC remains in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2014 will be based on the definitions of, and deductions from, capital under the Basel III capital rule (as such definitions and deductions are phased-in for 2014) and its Basel I risk-weighted assets (but subject to certain adjustments set forth in the rules). After January 1, 2015, and until PNC has exited parallel run, PNC’s regulatory risk-based Basel III ratios will be calculated using the standardized approach for risk-weights. Once PNC exits parallel run, its regulatory Basel III risk-based capital ratios will be the lower of the ratios calculated under the standardized approach or the advanced approaches.  Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject a banking organization to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal bank regulatory agencies, including a limitation on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance of a capital directive to increase capital and, in severe cases, the         6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents   termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. In some cases, the extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Generally, the smaller an institution’s capital base in relation to its risk-weighted or total assets, the greater the scope and severity of the agencies’ powers, ultimately permitting the agencies to appoint a receiver for the institution. Business activities may also be influenced by an institution’s capital classification. For instance, only a “well capitalized” insured depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval and an “adequately capitalized” insured depository institution may accept brokered deposits only with prior regulatory approval. In addition, in order to remain a financial holding company and engage in the broader range of financial activities authorized for such a company, PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. must remain “well capitalized”. At December 31, 2013, PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. exceeded the required ratios for classification as “well capitalized.” For additional discussion of capital adequacy requirements, we refer you to the Funding and Capital Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report and to Note 22 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.  In addition to these regulatory capital requirements, PNC is subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule, annual capital stress testing requirements and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, as well as the annual and mid-year Dodd-Frank capital stress testing (DFAST) requirements of the Federal Reserve and the OCC. As part of the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies (BHCs), including PNC, that have $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. This capital adequacy assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted by each participating BHC to the Federal Reserve that describes the company’s planned capital actions during the nine quarter review period, as well as the results of stress tests conducted by both the company and the Federal Reserve under different hypothetical macro-economic scenarios, including a supervisory adverse and a severely adverse scenario provided by the Federal Reserve. In evaluating a BHC’s capital plan, the Federal Reserve considers a number of factors, including the company’s risk profile, the strength of the company’s internal capital assessment process, and whether under different hypothetical macro-economic scenarios, including the supervisory severely stressed scenario, the company would be able to maintain throughout each quarter of the nine quarter planning horizon, even if it maintained its base case planned capital actions, (i) a projected pro forma Basel I Tier 1 common capital ratio above 5 percent, and (ii) regulatory risk-based and leverage capital ratios that exceed the minimums that are, or would then be, in effect for the company, taking into account the capital rules   adopted in July 2013 and any applicable phase-in periods. In addition, the Federal Reserve evaluates a company’s projected path towards compliance with the Basel III regulatory capital framework on a fully implemented basis. After completing its review, the Federal Reserve may object or not object to the firm’s proposed capital actions, such as plans to pay or increase common stock dividends, reinstate or increase common stock repurchase programs, or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments. In connection with the 2014 CCAR, PNC filed its capital plan and stress testing results using financial data as of September 30, 2013 with the Federal Reserve on January 6, 2014. PNC expects to receive the Federal Reserve’s response (either a non-objection or objection) to the capital plan submitted as part of the 2014 CCAR in March 2014.  As part of the CCAR and DFAST process, both the Federal Reserve and PNC release certain revenue, loss and capital results from their stress testing exercises, generally in March of each year. For the 2014 exercises, the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to publish its supervisory revenue, loss and capital projections for participating bank holding companies under the supervisory adverse and severely adverse macro-economic scenarios using the common assumptions concerning capital distributions established by the Federal Reserve in its DFAST regulations (DFAST capital action assumptions), as well as capital ratio information using the firm’s proposed base case capital actions. PNC also is required to publicly disclose its own estimates of certain capital, revenue and loss information under the same hypothetical supervisory severely adverse macro-economic scenario and applying the DFAST capital action assumptions. Federal Reserve regulations also require that PNC and other large bank holding companies conduct a separate mid-year stress test using financial data as of March 31st and three company-derived macro-economic scenarios (base, adverse and severely adverse) and publish a summary of the results under the severely adverse scenario in September.  Basel III Liquidity Requirements. The Basel III framework adopted by the Basel Committee also includes new short-term liquidity standards (the “Liquidity Coverage Ratio” or “LCR”) and long-term funding standards (the “Net Stable Funding Ratio” or “NSFR”).  In October 2013, the U.S. banking agencies requested comment on proposed rules that would implement the LCR. The proposed rules are designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of cash and high quality, unencumbered liquid assets (HQLA) to meet estimated net liquidity needs in a short-term stress scenario using liquidity inflow, outflow and maturity assumptions provided in the rules (net cash outflow). An institution’s LCR is the amount of its HQLA, as defined and calculated in accordance with the haircuts and limitations in the rule, divided by its net cash outflow, with the quotient expressed as a ratio. Under the proposed rules, banking organizations, including PNC and PNC Bank, N.A., that are subject to the         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 7   Table of Contents   advanced approaches for regulatory capital purposes would, following a phase-in period that is proposed to begin January 1, 2015, have to maintain an LCR equal to at least 1.0 based on the entity’s highest daily projected level of net cash outflows over the next 30 calendar days. Under the phase-in provisions of the proposed rules, banking organizations would have to maintain HQLA equal to 80% of their LCR requirement beginning in 2015 and 90% in 2016, with the LCR requirement becoming fully implemented in 2017. The comment period on the proposed rules closed on January 31, 2014. Although the impact on PNC will not be fully known until the rules are final, PNC has taken several actions to prepare for implementation of the LCR and we expect to be in compliance with the LCR requirements when they become effective.  The NSFR is designed to promote a stable maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. The Basel Committee, in January 2014, requested comment on a revised NSFR framework, with comments due by April 11, 2014. Under the revised framework, the NSFR would take effect by January 1, 2018, although the U.S. banking agencies have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR.  Parent Company Liquidity and Dividends. The principal source of our liquidity at the parent company level is dividends from PNC Bank, N.A. PNC Bank, N.A. is subject to various federal restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to PNC Bancorp, Inc., its direct parent, which is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of PNC. PNC Bank, N.A. is also subject to federal laws limiting extensions of credit to its parent holding company and non-bank affiliates as discussed in Note 22 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Further information on bank level liquidity and parent company liquidity and on certain contractual restrictions is also available in the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section and the Trust Preferred Securities and REIT Preferred Securities portion of the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements And Variable Interest Entities section of Item 7 of this Report, and in Note 14 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts and Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.  Federal Reserve rules provide that a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support such banks if necessary. Consistent with the “source of strength” policy for subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the corporation’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial   condition. Further, in providing guidance to the large BHCs participating in the 2014 CCAR, discussed above, the Federal Reserve stated that it expects capital plans submitted in 2014 will reflect conservative dividend payout ratios and net share repurchase programs, and that requests that imply common dividend payout ratios above 30% of projected after-tax net income available to common shareholders will receive particularly close scrutiny. The Federal Reserve also has stated that it expects BHCs that meet the minimum capital ratio requirements under the Basel III capital rule during the transition periods provided by the rule, but that do not meet the fully-phased in Basel III minimum plus capital conservation buffer ratio levels (plus any applicable capital surcharge for globally systemically important banks), to maintain prudent earnings retention policies with a view to meeting these levels in accordance with the phase-in schedule included in the Basel III capital rule.  Additional Powers Under the GLB Act. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act) permits a qualifying bank holding company to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in, or affiliate with financial companies engaging in, a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company. Permitted affiliates include securities underwriters and dealers, insurance companies and companies engaged in other activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or are determined by the Federal Reserve unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities. We became a financial holding company as of March 13, 2000. In order to be and remain a financial holding company, a bank holding company and its subsidiary depository institutions must be “well capitalized” and “well managed.” In addition, a financial holding company generally may not engage in a new financial activity, or acquire a company engaged in a new activity, if any of its insured depository institutions received a less than Satisfactory rating at its most recent evaluation under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Among other activities, we currently rely on our status as a financial holding company to conduct merchant banking activities and securities underwriting and dealing activities. As subsidiaries of a financial holding company under the GLB Act, our non-bank subsidiaries are generally allowed to conduct new financial activities, and PNC is generally permitted to acquire non-bank financial companies that have less than $10 billion in assets, with after-the-fact notice to the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve is the “umbrella” regulator of a financial holding company, with its operating entities, such as its subsidiary broker-dealers, investment advisers, insurance companies and banks, as well as investment companies advised by investment adviser subsidiaries of the financial holding company, also being subject to the jurisdiction of various federal and state “functional” regulators with normal regulatory responsibility for companies in their lines of business.         8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents  In addition, the GLB Act permits qualifying national banks to engage in expanded activities through the formation of a “financial subsidiary.” PNC Bank, N.A. has filed a financial subsidiary certification with the OCC and currently engages in insurance agency activities through financial subsidiaries. PNC Bank, N.A. may also generally engage through a financial subsidiary in any activity that is determined to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Federal Reserve. Certain activities, however, are impermissible for a financial subsidiary of a national bank, including certain insurance underwriting activities, insurance company investment activities, real estate investment or development, and merchant banking. In order to have a financial subsidiary, a national bank and each of its depository institution affiliates must be and remain “well capitalized” and “well managed.” In addition, a financial subsidiary generally may not engage in a new financial activity, or acquire a company engaged in a new financial activity, if the national bank and any of its insured depository institution affiliates received a less than Satisfactory rating at its most recent evaluation under the CRA.  Volcker Rule. In December 2013, the U.S. banking agencies, SEC and CFTC issued final rules to implement the “Volcker Rule” provisions of Dodd-Frank. The rules prohibit banks and their affiliates (collectively, banking entities) from trading as principal in securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments, but also includes several important exclusions and exemptions from this prohibition. These exclusions and exemptions, for example, permit banking entities, subject to a variety of conditions and restrictions, to trade for market making, risk mitigating hedging, liquidity management, and securities underwriting purposes, and to trade in U.S. government and municipal securities. The rules also prohibit banking entities from investing in, sponsoring, and having certain financial relationships with private funds (such as, for example, private equity or hedge funds that would be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940 but for the exemptions in sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that act) that are covered by the final rules (covered funds). Again there are exemptions from these restrictions which themselves are subject to a variety of conditions. Moreover, the rules prohibit banking entities from engaging in permitted trading or covered fund activities if the activity would involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties, result in a material exposure by the banking entity to a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy, or pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States. Banking entities, like PNC, that have $50 billion or more in total assets are required to establish and maintain an extensive and detailed enhanced compliance program designed to ensure that the entity complies with the requirements of the final rule.  The Federal Reserve issued an order in December 2013 that provides banking entities until July 21, 2015 to bring their activities and investments into conformance with the requirements of the Volcker Rule. The Federal Reserve, upon request, may extend this conformance period, either generally or with respect to particular activities or investments, for up to two additional one-year periods, and may extend the period up to an additional 5 years for investments held as of May 1, 2010 in qualifying illiquid funds. Based on the level of PNC’s trading assets and liabilities, PNC is not subject to the metrics reporting requirements of the final rules. For additional information concerning the potential impact of the Volcker Rule on PNC’s operations, please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.  Other Federal Reserve and OCC Regulation and Supervision. The federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective action as deemed appropriate for an insured depository institution and its holding company.  Laws and regulations limit the scope of our permitted activities and investments. National banks (such as PNC Bank, N.A.) and their operating subsidiaries generally may engage only in any activities that are determined by the OCC to be part of or incidental to the business of banking, although a financial subsidiary may engage in a broader range of activities as described above.  Moreover, examination ratings of “3” or lower, lower capital ratios than peer group institutions, regulatory concerns regarding management, controls, assets, operations or other factors, can all potentially result in practical limitations on the ability of a bank or bank holding company to engage in new activities, grow, acquire new businesses, repurchase its stock or pay dividends, or to continue to conduct existing activities. The OCC, moreover, has been applying certain heightened risk management and governance expectations in its supervision of PNC Bank, N.A. and other large national banks and recently proposed incorporating these expectations into the agency’s safety and soundness guidelines established under section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) (12 U.S.C. 1831p-1). If the OCC determines that a national bank is not in compliance with these or other guidelines established under section 39 of the FDI Act, the OCC may require the bank to submit a corrective action plan and may initiate enforcement action against the bank if an acceptable plan is not submitted or the bank fails to comply with an approved plan.  The Federal Reserve’s prior approval is required whenever we propose to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or thrift, to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of any bank or thrift, or to merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company or thrift holding company. The BHC Act enumerates the factors the Federal Reserve must consider when reviewing the merger of bank holding companies, the         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 9   Table of Contents   acquisition of banks, or the acquisition of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company. These factors include the competitive effects of the proposal in the relevant geographic markets; the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and banks involved in the transaction; the effect of the transaction on financial stability of the United States; the organizations’ compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served; and the records of performance under the CRA of the insured depository institutions involved in the transaction. In cases involving interstate bank acquisitions, the Federal Reserve also must consider the concentration of deposits nationwide and in certain individual states. OCC prior approval is required for PNC Bank, N.A. to acquire another insured bank or thrift by merger. In deciding whether to approve such a transaction, the OCC is required to consider factors similar to those that must be considered by the Federal Reserve. Our ability to grow through acquisitions could be limited by these approval requirements.  At December 31, 2013, PNC Bank, N.A. was rated “Outstanding” with respect to CRA.  Because of PNC’s ownership interest in BlackRock, BlackRock is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve.  FDIC Insurance. PNC Bank, N.A. is insured by the FDIC and subject to premium assessments. Regulatory matters could increase the cost of FDIC deposit insurance premiums to an insured bank as FDIC deposit insurance premiums are “risk based.” Therefore, higher fee percentages would be charged to banks that have lower capital ratios or higher risk profiles. These risk profiles take into account, among other things, weaknesses that are found by the primary banking regulator through its examination and supervision of the bank and the bank’s holdings of assets classified as higher risk by the FDIC. A negative evaluation by the FDIC or a bank’s primary federal banking regulator could increase the costs to a bank and result in an aggregate cost of deposit funds higher than that of competing banks in a lower risk category. The methodology for the deposit insurance base calculation currently uses average assets less Tier 1 capital.  Resolution Planning. Dodd-Frank requires bank holding companies that have $50 billion or more in assets, such as PNC, to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that includes, among other things, an analysis of how the company could be resolved in a rapid and orderly fashion if the company were to fail or experience material financial distress. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose restrictions on a covered bank holding company, including additional capital requirements or limitations on growth, if the agencies jointly determine that the company’s plan is not credible or would not facilitate a rapid and orderly resolution of the company under the U.S.   Bankruptcy Code (or other applicable resolution framework), and additionally could require the company to divest assets or take other actions if the company did not submit an acceptable resolution plan within two years after any such restrictions were imposed. The FDIC also has adopted a rule that requires large insured depository institutions, including PNC Bank, N.A., to periodically submit a resolution plan to the FDIC that includes, among other things, an analysis of how the institution could be resolved under the FDI Act in a manner that protects depositors and limits losses or costs to creditors of the bank in accordance with the FDI Act. Depending on how the agencies conduct their review of the resolution plans submitted by PNC and PNC Bank, N.A., these requirements could affect the ways in which PNC structures and conducts its business and result in higher compliance and operating costs. PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. submitted their first resolution plans under these rules in December 2013.  CFPB Regulation and Supervision. As noted above, Dodd-Frank gives the CFPB authority to examine PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. for compliance with a broad range of federal consumer financial laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations that relate to credit card, deposit, mortgage and other consumer financial products and services we offer. In addition, Dodd-Frank gives the CFPB broad authority to take corrective action against PNC Bank, N.A. and PNC as it deems appropriate. The CFPB also has powers that it was assigned in Dodd-Frank to issue regulations and take enforcement actions to prevent and remedy acts and practices relating to consumer financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. The agency also has authority to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service. These authorities are in addition to the authority the CFPB assumed on July 21, 2011 under existing consumer financial law governing the provision of consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has concentrated much of its initial rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgage related topics required under Dodd-Frank, including ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages.  In January 2014, new rules issued by the CFPB for mortgage origination and mortgage servicing became effective. The rules require lenders to conduct a reasonable and good faith determination at or before consummation of a residential mortgage loan that the borrower will have a reasonable ability to repay the loan. The regulations also define criteria for making Qualified Mortgages which entitle the lender and any assignee to either a conclusive or rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability to repay rule. The new mortgage servicing rules include new standards for notices to consumers, loss mitigation procedures, and consumer requests for information. Both the origination and servicing rules create new private rights of action for consumers in the event of certain violations. In addition to the exercise of its rulemaking         10 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents   authority, the CFPB is continuing its ongoing examination and supervisory activities with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products.  SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES REGULATION  Our registered broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC.  Several of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as investment advisers and may provide investment advisory services to clients, other PNC affiliates or related entities, including registered investment companies. Certain of these advisers are registered as investment advisers to private equity funds under rules adopted under Dodd-Frank.  Broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is the primary self-regulatory organization (SRO) for our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and the regulations thereunder. An investment adviser to a registered investment company is also subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the regulations thereunder. Our broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries also are subject to additional regulation by states or local jurisdictions.  Over the past several years, the SEC and other regulatory agencies have increased their focus on the mutual fund and broker-dealer industries. Congress and the SEC have adopted regulatory reforms and are considering additional reforms that have increased, and are likely to continue to increase, the extent of regulation of the mutual fund and broker-dealer industries and impose additional compliance obligations and costs on our subsidiaries involved with those industries. Under provisions of the federal securities laws applicable to broker-dealers, investment advisers and registered investment companies and their service providers, a determination by a court or regulatory agency that certain violations have occurred at a company or its affiliates can result in fines, restitution, a limitation on permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain types of infractions and violations can also affect a public company in its timing and ability to expeditiously issue new securities into the capital markets. In addition, certain changes in the activities of a broker-dealer require approval from FINRA, and FINRA takes into account a variety of considerations in acting upon applications for such approval, including internal controls, capital levels, management experience and quality, prior enforcement and disciplinary history and supervisory concerns.  Title VII of Dodd-Frank imposes new comprehensive and significant regulations on the activities of financial institutions that are active in the U.S. over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives and foreign exchange markets. Title VII was enacted to (i) address systemic risk issues, (ii) bring greater transparency to the derivatives markets, (iii) provide enhanced disclosures and protection to customers, and (iv) promote market integrity. Among other things, Title VII: (i) requires the registration of both “swap dealers” and “major swap participants” with one or both of the CFTC (in the case of non security-based swaps) and the SEC (in the case of security-based swaps); (ii) requires that most standardized swaps be centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house and traded on a centralized exchange or swap execution facility; (iii) subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to capital and margin requirements in excess of historical practice; (iv) subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to comprehensive new recordkeeping and real-time public reporting requirements; (v) subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to new business conduct requirements, including the provision of daily marks to counterparties and disclosing to counterparties (pre-execution) the material risks, material incentives, and any conflicts of interest associated with their swap; and (vi) imposes special duties on swap dealers and major swap participants when transacting a swap with a “special entity” (e.g., governmental agency (federal, state or local) or political subdivision thereof, pension plan or endowment).  Based on the definition of a “swap dealer” under Title VII, PNC Bank, N.A. registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer on January 31, 2013. As a result thereof, PNC Bank, N.A. is subject to the regulations and requirements imposed on registered swap dealers, and the CFTC will have a meaningful supervisory role with respect to PNC Bank, N.A.’s derivatives and foreign exchange businesses. Because of the limited volume of our security-based swap activities, PNC Bank, N.A. has not registered with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer. The regulations and requirements applicable to swap dealers will collectively impose implementation and ongoing compliance burdens on PNC Bank, N.A. and will introduce additional legal risks (including as a result of newly applicable antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action).  In addition, an investment adviser to private funds or to registered investment companies may be required to register with the CFTC as a commodity pool operator. Registration could impose significant new regulatory compliance burdens. Presently, we expect our subsidiaries that serve as investment advisers to such entities to be eligible for exemptions from registration as a commodity pool operator.  BlackRock has subsidiaries in securities and related businesses subject to SEC, other governmental agencies, state, local and FINRA regulation, and a federally chartered nondepository trust company subsidiary subject to supervision         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 11   Table of Contents   and regulation by the OCC. For additional information about the regulation of BlackRock by these agencies and otherwise, we refer you to the discussion under the “Regulation” section of Item 1 Business in BlackRock’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which may be obtained electronically at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.  COMPETITION  We are subject to intense competition from various financial institutions and from non-bank entities that can offer a number of similar products and services without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions.  In making loans, PNC Bank, N.A. competes with traditional banking institutions as well as consumer finance companies, leasing companies and other non-bank lenders, and institutional investors including collateralized loan obligation (CLO) managers, hedge funds, mutual fund complexes and private equity firms. Loan pricing, structure and credit standards are extremely important in the current environment as we seek to achieve appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Traditional deposit-taking activities are also subject to pricing pressures and to customer migration as a result of intense competition for consumer deposits and investments.  PNC Bank, N.A. competes for deposits with:      •    Other commercial banks,      •    Savings banks,      •    Savings and loan associations,      •    Credit unions,      •    Treasury management service companies,      •    Insurance companies, and      •    Issuers of commercial paper and other securities, including mutual funds.  Our various non-bank businesses engaged in investment banking and alternative investment activities compete with:      •    Commercial banks,      •    Investment banking firms,      •    Merchant banks,      •    Insurance companies,      •    Private equity firms, and      •    Other investment vehicles.  In providing asset management services, our businesses compete with:      •    Investment management firms,      •    Large banks and other financial institutions,      •    Brokerage firms,      •    Mutual fund complexes, and      •    Insurance companies.  We include here by reference the additional information regarding competition and factors affecting our competitive position included in the Item 1A Risk Factors section of this Report.

ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS  We are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a financial services organization, certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make. Thus, we encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business, and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks.  Our success is dependent on our ability to identify, understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability. These risks include, but are not limited to, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, model risk, technology, compliance and legal risk, and strategic and reputation risk. We discuss our principal risk management processes and, in appropriate places, related historical performance in the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Report.  The following are the key risk factors that affect us. Any one or more of these risk factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, in addition to presenting other possible adverse consequences, including those described below. These risk factors and other risks are also discussed further in other sections of this Report.  Difficult economic conditions or volatility in the financial markets would likely have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.  As a financial services company, PNC’s business and overall financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of poor or         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 13   Table of Contents   weak economic conditions, particularly in the United States but also to some extent in the global economy. The extreme recessionary conditions that began in 2007 and ended in 2009 had a negative financial impact across the financial services industry, including on PNC. Such severe economic conditions can lead to turmoil and volatility in financial markets, which can increase the adverse impact on financial institutions such as PNC. A return to recessionary economic conditions in the United States would likely adversely affect PNC, its business and financial performance, perhaps in ways more detrimental than the effects of the last recession.  The economic recovery from the last recession continued in 2013, but at a pace below trend for other recent recoveries from recessions. Job growth has not yet been sufficient to significantly reduce high unemployment in the United States. Consumer and business confidence is improving but remains in the cautious zone.  Although Congress and the President reached agreement on a budget and on the U.S. government’s debt ceiling in early 2014, significant long-term issues remain with respect to federal budgetary and spending matters, and these current resolutions only have temporary effect. For example, the new budget only covers the period through the end of September 2014. Uncertainty resulting from these issues and the recent difficulties in resolving these types of matters could contribute to slower economic growth. Another period where the Congress and the President cannot reach resolution of key federal budgetary and spending matters, leading to events such as actual or threatened government shutdowns or defaults, could adversely affect the U.S. economy. In recent years, a downgrade in the ratings for U.S. Treasury securities by a credit rating agency, an extended government shutdown, and substantial spending cuts through sequestration have resulted from government stalemate on budgetary issues.  The global recession and disruption of the financial markets led to concerns over the solvency of certain European countries, affecting these countries’ capital markets access and in some cases sovereign credit ratings, as well as market perception of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to these countries. These concerns continue even as the global economy is recovering. If measures to address sovereign debt and financial sector problems in Europe are inadequate, they may result in a delayed economic recovery, the exit of one or more member states from the Eurozone, or more severe economic and financial conditions. If realized, these risk scenarios could contribute to severe financial market stress or a global recession, likely affecting the economy and capital markets in the United States as well.  Other Risk Factors, presented below, address specific ways in which we may be adversely impacted by economic conditions.    Our business and financial results are subject to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties.  Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from, among other things, extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks, particularly given the high percentage of our assets represented directly or indirectly by loans, and the importance of lending to our overall business. We manage credit risk by assessing and monitoring the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and by diversifying our loan portfolio. Many factors impact credit risk.  A borrower’s ability to repay a loan can be adversely affected by individual factors, such as business performance, job losses or health issues. A weak or deteriorating economy and changes in the United States or global markets also could adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans. Any decrease in our borrowers’ ability to repay loans would result in higher levels of nonperforming loans, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.  Despite maintaining a diversified loan portfolio, in the ordinary course of business, we may have concentrated credit exposure to a particular person or entity, industry, region or counterparty. Events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, regions or markets, a decrease in the credit quality of a customer base or an adverse change in the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers could adversely affect us.  Our credit risk may be exacerbated when collateral held by us to secure obligations to us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.  In part due to improvement in economic conditions, as well as actions taken by PNC to manage its portfolio, PNC’s provision for credit losses has declined substantially every year since the end of the recent recession. If we were to once again experience higher levels of provision for credit losses, it could result in lower levels of net income.         14 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents  Our business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which we have no control and which we may not be able to predict adequately.  As a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve, or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on our business, our profitability and the value of our financial assets and liabilities. For example:      •    Changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities, which impacts our overall net interest income and profitability.      •    Such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, affect our loss rates on those assets.      •    Such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposit accounts.      •    Such changes can also affect our ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the effectiveness of those hedges in helping to manage such risks.      •    Movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in impairments of mortgage servicing assets or otherwise affect the profitability of such assets.  The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as PNC. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans and that we pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Both due to the impact on rates and by controlling access to direct funding from the Federal Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve’s policies also influence, to a significant extent, our cost of funding. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effects that they may have on our activities and financial results. The continuation of the current very low interest rate environment, which is expected to continue at least through mid-year 2015 based on statements by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, could affect consumer and   business behavior in ways that are adverse to us and could also hamper our ability to increase our net interest income.  Recently, the British Bankers’ Association (BBA) took steps to change the process for determining LIBOR. The method for determining how LIBOR is formulated and its use in the market may change, including, but not limited to, reducing the currencies and tenors for which LIBOR is calculated and requiring banks to provide LIBOR submissions based on actual transaction data. It is uncertain what changes, if any, will be required in the method for determining LIBOR and the impact such changes will have on our LIBOR-linked debt or preferred securities, or any of our loans, derivatives or other financial assets or obligations.  Our business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of changes in the values of financial assets.  As a financial institution, a substantial majority of PNC’s assets and liabilities are financial in nature (items such as loans, securities, servicing rights, deposits and borrowings). Such assets and liabilities will fluctuate in value, often significantly, due to movements in the financial markets or market volatility as well as developments specific to the asset or liability in question.  Credit-based assets and liabilities will fluctuate in value due to changes in the perceived creditworthiness of the borrowers and also due to changes in market interest rates. A lessening of confidence in the creditworthiness of the United States or other governments whose securities we hold could impact the value of those holdings. Changes in loan prepayment speeds, usually based on fluctuations in market interest rates, could adversely impact the value of our mortgage servicing rights. The financial strength of counterparties, with whom we have hedged some of our exposure to certain types of assets, could affect the value of such transactions and assets. Additionally, the underlying value of an asset under lease may decrease due to supply and demand for the asset or the condition of the asset at the end of the lease. This could cause our recorded lease value to decline.  In many cases, PNC marks its assets and liabilities to market on its financial statements, either through its Net income and Retained earnings or through adjustments to Accumulated other comprehensive income on its balance sheet. We may need to record losses in value of financial assets even where our expectation of realizing the face value of the underlying instrument has not changed.  In addition, asset management revenue is primarily based on a percentage of the value of the assets being managed and thus is impacted by general changes in market valuations. Thus, although we are not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income.         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 15   Table of Contents  Our business and financial performance are dependent on our ability to attract and retain customers for our products and services, which may be negatively impacted by lack of consumer and business economic confidence as well as our actions, including our ability to anticipate and satisfy customer demands for products and services.  As a financial institution, our performance is subject to risks associated with the loss of customer confidence and demand. Economic and market developments, in the United States, Europe or elsewhere, may affect consumer and business confidence levels. If customers lose confidence due to a weak or deteriorating economy or uncertainty surrounding the future of the economy, the demand for our products and services could suffer.  We may also fail to attract or retain customers if we are unable to develop and market products and services that meet evolving customer needs or demands or if we are unable to deliver them effectively to our customers, particularly to the extent that our competitors are able to do so.  News or other publicity that impairs our reputation, or the reputation of our industry generally also could cause a loss of customers.  If we fail to attract and retain customers, demand for our loans and other financial products could decrease, we could experience adverse changes in payment patterns and consumers may not seek investments with us. We could lose interest income from a decline in credit usage and fee income from a decline in investments and other transactions. PNC’s customers could remove money from checking and savings accounts and other types of deposit accounts in favor of other banks or other types of investment products. Deposits are a low cost source of funds. Therefore, losing deposits could increase our funding costs and reduce our net interest income.  For several years, the United States has been in a very low interest rate environment. This situation has decreased the attractiveness of alternatives to bank checking and savings accounts, some of which historically have provided higher yields but may lack deposit insurance and some of the convenience associated with more traditional banking products. If interest rates were to rise significantly, customers may be less willing to maintain balances in non-interest bearing or low interest bank accounts, which could result in a loss of deposits or a relatively higher cost of funds to PNC. This could also result in a loss of fee income.  In our asset management business, investment performance is an important factor influencing the level of assets that we manage. Poor investment performance could impair revenue and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products. Additionally, the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish. Overall economic conditions may limit the amount that customers are   able or willing to invest as well as the value of the assets they do invest. The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products offered by us without regard to the performance of our products. Such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on our assets under management and asset management revenues and earnings.  As a regulated financial services firm, we are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and the financial services industry as a whole is subject to significant regulatory reform initiatives in the United States and elsewhere.  PNC is a bank holding company and a financial holding company and is subject to numerous governmental regulations involving both its business and organization.  Our businesses are subject to regulation by multiple banking, consumer protection and securities regulatory bodies. Applicable laws and regulations restrict our ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from subsidiaries that operate in the banking and securities businesses and impose capital adequacy requirements. PNC’s ability to service its obligations and pay dividends to shareholders is largely dependent on the receipt of dividends and advances from its subsidiaries, primarily PNC Bank, N.A. The Federal Reserve requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve could require PNC to commit resources to PNC Bank, N.A. when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of PNC or its shareholders or creditors.  Applicable laws and regulations restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, mutual fund and other customers, and for the protection of customer information, among other things. We are also subject to laws and regulations designed to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and transactions with persons, companies or foreign governments designated by U.S. authorities.  Starting shortly after the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007, we have faced, and expect to continue to face for the foreseeable future, increased regulation of the financial services industry as a result of initiatives intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions, financial market stability, the transparency and liquidity of financial markets, and consumer and investor protection. We also expect, in many cases, more intense scrutiny from bank and consumer protection supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of laws and regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with regulations and other supervisory initiatives will likely increase the company’s costs and reduce its revenue, and may limit the company’s ability to pursue certain desirable business         16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents   opportunities. New reforms will also introduce additional legal risk (including as a result of newly applicable antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action), affect regulatory oversight, holding company capital requirements, and residential mortgage products. The consequences of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions as well as damage to our reputation and businesses.  A number of reform provisions are likely to significantly impact the ways in which banks and bank holding companies, including PNC, do business. Some of the reform initiatives have led to the formation of new regulatory bodies, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has authority to regulate consumer financial products and services sold by banks and non-bank companies and to supervise banks with assets of more than $10 billion and their affiliates for compliance with Federal consumer protection laws. Other agencies have significant new powers relevant to PNC, such as the authority now held by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to regulate non security-based swaps, which, among other things, led PNC Bank, N.A. to register with the CFTC as a swap dealer in early 2013.  See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report for more information concerning the regulation of PNC and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, including some of the matters discussed in this Risk Factor. Note 22 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report also discusses some of the regulation applicable to PNC.  The following describes the key risks associated with some of the initiatives recently undertaken as part of the regulatory reform initiatives affecting the financial services industry, either where pending rules have not yet been finalized or where the impact of new rules has not been substantially realized.      •    In December 2013, the U.S. banking agencies, the SEC and the CFTC adopted regulations implementing the Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-Frank. The Volcker Rule prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in some types of proprietary trading and restricts the ability of banks and their affiliates to sponsor, invest in or have specified other financial relationships with certain types of private funds (referred to as covered funds). We discuss the Volcker Rule in the Supervision and Regulation section included in Item 1 of this Report. PNC discontinued its designated proprietary trading operations several years ago. While we continue to assess the implications of the final regulations, we currently do not expect the proprietary trading aspects of the final regulations to have a material effect on PNC’s businesses or revenue. Nevertheless, the Volcker Rule regulations place limits and conditions on many types of permissible trading          activities, including transactions conducted for purposes of hedging, liquidity management, underwriting or to facilitate customer transactions. These limits and restrictions could cause PNC to forego engaging in hedging or other transactions that it would otherwise undertake in the ordinary course of business and, thus, to some extent, may limit the ability of PNC to most effectively hedge its risks, manage its balance sheet or provide products or services to its customers.      •    In addition, as of December 31, 2013, PNC held interests in private equity and hedge funds that appear to be covered funds subject to the Volcker Rule regulations totaling approximately $806 million, including three sponsored funds with total invested capital of approximately $317 million. Certain of PNC’s REIT Preferred Securities also were issued by statutory trusts that, as currently structured, are considered covered funds. PNC will need to sell, restructure, or otherwise conform substantially all of these investments and cease sponsoring covered funds by July 21, 2015, although this compliance date may be extended, potentially for several years, with the approval of the Federal Reserve. Moreover, it is likely that at least some of the amounts invested in these funds will reduce over time in the ordinary course before compliance is required. A forced sale or restructuring of PNC’s investments due to the Volcker Rule would likely result in PNC receiving less value than it would otherwise have received or experiencing other adverse consequences. As of December 31, 2013, PNC also held approximately $2.4 billion of senior debt interests in collateralized loan obligation (CLO) funds that may be considered covered funds. At December 31, 2013, the unrealized loss associated with the aforementioned CLO funds was approximately $14 million. The agencies are currently reviewing the treatment of CLO funds under the final regulations.      •    On February 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve issued final rules that establish new enhanced prudential standards relating to liquidity risk and overall risk management for bank holding companies (like PNC) that have $50 billion or more in consolidated total assets. These rules also implement the provisions of Dodd-Frank that require the Federal Reserve to impose a maximum 15-to-1 debt to equity ratio on a bank holding company if the FSOC determines that the company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States and that the imposition of such a debt-to-equity requirement would mitigate such risk. The Federal Reserve, however, continues to develop the other enhanced prudential standards that are required under Dodd-Frank for bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated total assets, including the counterparty credit exposure limits and early remediation requirements that were         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 17   Table of Contents          the subject of proposed rules issued in December 2011. Under these proposed rules, PNC could be subject to increasingly stringent actions by the Federal Reserve if its financial condition or risk management deteriorated as reflected by the company’s current or projected post-stress capital levels, compliance with supervisory liquidity and risk management standards and, in some instances, market-based indicators, such as credit default swap spreads. In addition, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it intends to continue to develop the set of enhanced prudential standards that apply to large bank holding companies in order to further promote the resiliency of such firms and the U.S. financial system. Until the Federal Reserve’s rules and initiatives to establish these enhanced prudential standards are completed, we are unable to fully estimate their impact on PNC, although we expect these initiatives will result in increased compliance costs.      •    Regulatory agencies have proposed rules to implement the Dodd-Frank provisions requiring retention of credit risk by certain securitization participants through holding interests in the securitization vehicles, but the rules are not yet finalized or effective. As a result, the ultimate impact of these Dodd-Frank provisions on PNC remains unpredictable. That impact on PNC could be direct, by requiring PNC to hold interests in a securitization vehicle or other assets that represent a portion of the credit risk of the assets held by the securitization vehicle, or indirect, by impacting markets in which PNC participates and increasing the costs associated with loan origination. Since the beginning of the financial crisis, there has been and continues to be substantially less private (that is, non-government backed) securitization activity than had previously been the case. It is unclear at present whether and to what extent the private securitization markets will rebound. If the markets for private securitizations rebound and PNC decides to increase its participation in those markets, we would likely be required under the regulations to retain more risk than would otherwise have been the case, and as a result could be required to consolidate certain securitization vehicles on our balance sheet, with currently an uncertain financial impact.  On the indirect impact side, PNC originates loans of a variety of types, including residential and commercial mortgages, credit card, auto, and student, that historically have commonly been securitized, and PNC is also a significant servicer of residential and commercial mortgages held by others, including securitization vehicles. PNC anticipates that the risk retention requirements will impact the market for loans of types that historically have been securitized, potentially affecting the volumes of loans securitized, the types of loan products made available, the terms   on which loans are offered, consumer and business demand for loans, and the need for third-party loan servicers. It should be noted that the risk retention rules themselves could have the effect of slowing the rebound in the securitization markets. One effect of having substantially reduced opportunities to securitize loans would likely be a reduction in the willingness of banks, including PNC, to make loans due to balance sheet management requirements. Any of these potential impacts of the Dodd-Frank risk retention rules could affect the way in which PNC conducts its business, including its product offerings.  A failure to comply, or to have adequate policies and procedures designed to comply, with regulatory requirements could expose us to damages, fines and regulatory penalties and other regulatory actions, which could be significant, and could also injure our reputation with customers and others with whom we do business.  New capital and liquidity standards will result in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case.  We are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. These requirements are currently undergoing significant changes as a result of the final rules adopted by the U.S. banking agencies in July 2013 to implement the new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital established by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (“BCBS”) known as “Basel III,” as well as to implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Significant parts of these rules became effective for PNC on January 1, 2014, while other aspects will become effective on January 1, 2015 or thereafter.  In November 2013, the U.S. banking agencies also requested comment on proposed rules that would implement the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), a new, short-term quantitative liquidity requirement included in the BCBS Basel III framework. The proposal would require PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. to maintain an amount of qualifying high-quality liquid assets sufficient to cover the entity’s projected net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period using inflow, outflow and maturity assumptions included in the rule. Under the proposal, the LCR would become effective and begin to be phased-in on January 1, 2015, with the standard being fully implemented on January 1, 2017. The comment period on the proposed rules ended on January 31, 2014, and final rules have not yet been issued. Although the impact of the LCR on PNC will not be fully known until the rules are final, PNC has taken several actions to prepare for implementation of the LCR, and we expect to be in compliance with the rules when they become effective. In February 2014, the Federal Reserve also adopted new liquidity risk management requirements for bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated total         18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents   assets (like PNC), which become effective on January 1, 2015. We discuss these new capital requirements and liquidity standards in the Supervision and Regulation section included in Item 1 of this Report.  The U.S. banking agencies also have proposed, or are considering, additional rules that would require certain U.S. banking organizations to maintain a supplemental leverage ratio in excess of the level required by the July 2013 rules, to hold additional capital to the extent the organizations engage in certain activities deemed to present special risks (such as relying on short-term wholesale funding), or to maintain a certain aggregate level of capital and long-term unsecured debt to facilitate a resolution of the institution. In January 2014, the BCBS also requested comment on another liquidity component of the international Basel III framework, the net stable funding ratio, which is designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable, long-term funding profile in relation to their asset composition and off-balance sheet activities.  The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required could limit PNC’s business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in PNC taking steps to increase its capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or being limited in its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or selling or refraining from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are inconsistent with the assets’ underlying risks. In addition, the new liquidity standards likely will require PNC to increase its holdings of highly liquid short-term investments, thereby reducing PNC’s ability to invest in longer-term or less liquid assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet or interest rate risk management perspective. Moreover, although these new requirements are being phased in over time, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions. Moreover, until the scope and terms of pending or future rulemakings relating to capital, liquidity, or liability composition are known, the extent to which such rules may apply to PNC and the potential impact of such rules on PNC will remain uncertain.  We depend on information systems, both internally and through third-parties, to conduct our business and could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of, or security breaches affecting, those systems.  As a large financial company, we handle a substantial volume of customer and other financial transactions virtually on a continuous basis. As a result, we rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business and to process, record, and monitor our transactions. In recent years, PNC has increased substantially in size, scope and complexity. We have also seen more customer usage of technological solutions for financial   needs and higher expectations of customers and regulators regarding effective and safe systems operation. The need to ensure proper functioning of these systems has become more challenging, and the costs involved in that effort are greater than ever.  The risks to these systems result from a variety of factors, both internal and external. In some cases, these factors are largely outside of our control, including the potential for bad acts on the part of hackers, criminals, employees and others. In other cases, our systems could fail to operate as needed due to factors such as design or performance issues, human error, unexpected transaction volumes, or inadequate measures to protect against unauthorized access. We are also at risk for the impact of natural or other disasters, terrorism, international hostilities and the like on our systems or for the effect of outages or other failures involving power or communications systems operated by others. In addition, we face a variety of types of cyber attacks, some of which are discussed in more detail below. Cyber attacks often include efforts to disrupt our ability to provide services or to gain access to confidential company and customer information.  We rely on other companies for the provision of a broad range of products and services. Many of these products and services include information systems themselves or involve the use of such systems in connection with providing the products or services. In some cases, these other companies provide the infrastructure that supports electronic communications. These other companies are generally subject to many of the same risks we face with respect to our systems. To the extent we rely on these other companies, we could be adversely affected if they are impacted by system failures or cyber attacks.  All of these types of events, whether resulting from cyber attacks or other internal or external sources, expose customer and other confidential information to security risks. They also could disrupt our ability to use our accounting, deposit, loan and other systems and could cause errors in transactions with customers, vendors or other counterparties.  In addition, our customers often use their own devices, such as computers, smartphones and tablets, to do business with us. We have limited ability to assure the safety and security of our customers’ transactions with us to the extent they are utilizing their own devices.  We are faced with ongoing efforts by others to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. Some of these involve efforts to enter our systems directly by going through or around our security protections. Others involve the use of schemes such as “phishing” to gain access to identifying customer information, often from customers themselves. Most corporate and commercial transactions are now handled electronically, and our retail customers increasingly use online access and mobile devices to bank with us. The ability to conduct business with         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 19   Table of Contents   us in this manner depends on secure transmission of confidential information, which increases the risk of data security breaches.  Starting in late 2012, there have been several well-publicized series of apparently related denial of service attacks on large financial services companies, including PNC. In a denial of service attack, individuals or organizations flood commercial websites with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal of disrupting the ability of commercial enterprises to process transactions and possibly making their websites unavailable to customers for extended periods of time. The attacks against PNC have resulted in temporary disruptions in customers’ ability to access the corporate website and to perform on-line banking transactions. To date, no customer data has been lost or compromised and these efforts have not had a material impact on PNC. We cannot, however, provide assurance that future attacks of this type might not have a greater effect on PNC.  As our customers regularly use PNC-issued credit and debit cards to pay for transactions with retailers and other businesses, there is the risk of data security breaches at those other businesses covering PNC account information. When our customers use PNC-issued cards to make purchases from those businesses, card account information is provided to the business. If the business’s systems that process or store card account information are subject to a data security breach, holders of our cards who have made purchases from that business may experience fraud on their card accounts. PNC may suffer losses associated with reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent transactions on customers’ card accounts, as well as for other costs related to data security compromise events, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts. In addition, PNC provides card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with payment networks such as Visa and MasterCard. Under these agreements, we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data security breach.  In late 2013, several large retailers, including most prominently Target, disclosed that they have suffered substantial data security breaches compromising millions of card accounts. To date, PNC’s losses and costs related to these breaches have not been material, but other similar events in the future could be more significant to PNC.  Methods used by others to attack information systems change frequently (with generally increasing sophistication), often are not recognized until launched against a target, may be supported by foreign governments or other well-financed entities, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world. As a result, we may be unable to address these methods in advance of attacks, including by implementing adequate preventive measures.  We have policies, procedures and systems (including business continuity programs) designed to prevent or limit the effect of possible failures, interruptions or breaches in security of information systems. We design our business continuity and other information and technology risk management programs to manage our capabilities to provide services in the case of an event resulting in material disruptions of business activities affecting our employees, facilities, technology or suppliers. We regularly seek to test the effectiveness of and enhance these policies, procedures and systems.  Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our business continuity planning and our ability to anticipate the timing and nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of natural and other disasters, terrorist activities, international hostilities and the like could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional governments, including emergency responders, or on the part of other organizations and businesses with which we deal, particularly those on which we depend but have no control over.  In recent years, we have incurred significant expense towards improving the reliability of our systems and their security from attack. Nonetheless, there remains the risk that an adverse event might occur. If one does occur, we might not be able to fix it timely or adequately. To the extent that the risk relates to products or services provided by others, we seek to engage in due diligence and monitoring to limit the risk, but here too we cannot eliminate it. Should an adverse event affecting another company’s systems occur, we may not have indemnification or other protection from the other company sufficient to compensate us or otherwise protect us from the consequences.  The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of any of our information or communications systems, or the systems of other companies on which we rely, could result in a wide variety of adverse consequences to PNC. This risk is greater if the issue is widespread or results in financial losses to our customers. Possible adverse consequences include damage to our reputation or a loss of customer business. We also could face litigation or additional regulatory scrutiny. Litigation or regulatory actions in turn could lead to liability or other sanctions, including fines and penalties or reimbursement of customers adversely affected by a systems problem or security breach. Even if we do not suffer any material adverse consequences as a result of events affecting us directly, successful attacks or systems failures at other large financial institutions could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions including PNC. Also, systems problems, including those resulting from third party attacks, whether at PNC or at our competitors, would likely increase regulatory and customer concerns regarding the functioning, safety and security of such systems generally. In that case, we would expect to incur even higher levels of costs with respect to prevention and mitigation of these risks.         20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents  We continually encounter technological change and we could falter in our ability to remain competitive in this arena.  The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. We have been investing in technology and connectivity to automate functions previously performed manually, to facilitate the ability of customers to engage in financial transactions, and otherwise to enhance the customer experience with respect to our products and services. On the retail side, this has included developments such as more sophisticated ATMs and expanded access to banking transactions through the internet, smart phones, tablets and other remote devices. These efforts have all been in response to actual and anticipated customer behavior and expectations. Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy customer demands and create efficiencies in our operations. A failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to technology, whether because we fail to anticipate customer expectations or because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not rolled out in a timely manner, may cause us to lose market share or incur additional expense.  There are risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business.  PNC relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. Also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient. See the Model Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Report.  Our asset and liability valuations and the determination of the amount of loss allowances and impairments taken on our assets are highly subjective, and inaccurate estimates could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.  We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Changes in underlying factors or assumptions in any of the areas underlying our estimates could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations. During periods of market disruption, it may be more difficult to value certain of our assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were historically in active markets with significant observable data that rapidly become illiquid due to market volatility, a loss in market confidence or other factors. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented market conditions in any particular market could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements.  The determination of the amount of loss allowances and asset impairments varies by asset type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. Although we have policies and procedures in place to determine loss allowance and asset impairments, due to the substantial subjective nature of this area, there can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken or allowances provided for in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances.  Our business and financial results could be impacted materially by adverse results in legal proceedings.  Many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. We have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from our business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies we have acquired). In addition, we are regularly the subject of governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory inquiry. We also are at risk when we have agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, they face, such as in connection with the sale of a business or assets by us. The results of these legal proceedings could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm.         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 21   Table of Contents  Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies.  We discuss further the unpredictability of legal proceedings and describe certain of our pending legal proceedings in Note 23 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.  PNC faces legal and regulatory risk arising out of its residential mortgage businesses.  Numerous federal and state governmental, legislative and regulatory authorities are investigating practices in the business of mortgage and home equity loan lending and servicing and in the mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance industries. PNC has received inquiries from governmental, legislative and regulatory authorities on these topics and is responding to these inquiries. These inquiries and investigations could lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, possibly resulting in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, alterations in our business practices and additional expenses and collateral costs.  In addition to governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, PNC, like other companies with residential mortgage and home equity loan origination and servicing operations, faces the risk of class actions, other litigation and claims from: the owners of, investors in, or purchasers of such loans originated or serviced by PNC (or securities backed by such loans), homeowners involved in foreclosure proceedings or various mortgage-related insurance programs, downstream purchasers of homes sold after foreclosure, title insurers, and other potential claimants. Included among these claims are claims from purchasers of mortgage and home equity loans seeking the repurchase of loans where the loans allegedly breached origination covenants and representations and warranties made to the purchasers in the purchase and sale agreements.  At this time PNC cannot predict the ultimate overall cost to or effect upon PNC from governmental, legislative or regulatory actions and private litigation or claims arising out of residential mortgage and home equity loan lending, servicing or reinsurance practices, although such actions, litigation and claims could, individually or in the aggregate, result in significant expense. See Note 23 Legal Proceedings and Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding federal and state governmental,   legislative and regulatory inquiries and investigations and additional information regarding potential repurchase obligations relating to mortgage and home equity loans.  There is a continuing risk of incurring costs related to further remedial and related efforts required by consent orders and related to repurchase requests arising out of either the foreclosure process or origination issues. Reputational damage arising out of this industry-wide inquiry could also have an adverse effect upon our existing mortgage and home equity loan business and could reduce future business opportunities. Investors in mortgage loans and other assets that we sell are more likely to seek indemnification from us against losses or otherwise seek to have us share in such losses.  The CFPB has issued new rules for mortgage origination and mortgage servicing. Both the origination and servicing rules create new private rights of action for consumers against lenders and servicers like PNC in the event of certain violations. For additional information concerning the mortgage rules, see Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report.  Additionally, each GSE is currently in conservatorship, with its primary regulator acting as a conservator. We cannot predict when or if the conservatorships will end or whether, as a result of legislative or regulatory action, there will be any associated changes to the structure of the GSEs or the housing finance industry more generally, including, but not limited to, changes to the relationship among the GSEs, the government and the private markets. The effects of any such reform on our business and financial results are uncertain.  Our regional concentrations make us at risk to adverse economic conditions in our primary retail banking footprint.  Our retail banking business is primarily concentrated within our retail branch network footprint. Although our other businesses are national in scope, to a lesser extent these other businesses also have a greater presence within these primary geographic markets. Thus, we are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Southeast regions.  We grow our business in part by acquiring other financial services companies or assets from time to time, and these acquisitions present a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.  Acquisitions of other financial services companies, financial services assets and related deposits and other liabilities present risks and uncertainties to PNC in addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired.  In general, acquisitions may be substantially more expensive or take longer to complete than anticipated (including         22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K   Table of Contents   unanticipated costs incurred in connection with the integration of the acquired company). Anticipated benefits (including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains) may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events.  Our ability to achieve anticipated results from acquisitions is often dependent also on the extent of credit losses in the acquired loan portfolios and the extent of deposit attrition, which are, in part, related to the state of economic and financial markets.  Also, litigation and governmental investigations that may be pending at the time of the acquisition or be filed or commenced thereafter, as a result of an acquisition or otherwise, could impact the timing or realization of anticipated benefits to PNC. Note 23 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes several legal proceedings related to pre-acquisition activities of companies we have acquired, including National City. Other such legal proceedings may be commenced in the future.  Integration of an acquired company’s business and operations into PNC, including conversion of the acquired company’s different systems and procedures, may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results relating to the acquired company’s or PNC’s existing businesses. In some cases, acquisitions involve our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets, and these situations also present risks and uncertainties in instances where we may be inexperienced in these new areas.  Our ability to analyze the risks presented by prospective acquisitions, as well as our ability to prepare in advance of closing for integration, depends, in part, on the information we can gather with respect to the target, which is more limited than the information we have regarding companies we already own.  As a regulated financial institution, our ability to pursue or complete attractive acquisition opportunities could be negatively impacted by regulatory delays or other regulatory issues.  We operate in a highly competitive environment, in terms of the products and services we offer and the geographic markets in which we conduct business, as well as in our labor markets where we compete for talented employees. Competition could adversely impact our customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as our credit spreads and product pricing, causing us to lose market share and deposits and revenues.  We are subject to intense competition from various financial institutions as well as from non-bank entities that engage in many similar activities without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions. This competition is   described in Item 1 of this Report under “Competition.” Competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies, in connection with current market conditions or otherwise.  In all, the principal bases for competition are pricing (including the interest rates charged on loans or paid on interest-bearing deposits), product structure, the range of products and services offered, and the quality of customer service (including convenience and responsiveness to customer needs and concerns). The ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry, and it is a critically important component to customer satisfaction as it affects our ability to deliver the right products and services.  Another increasingly competitive factor in the financial services industry is the competition to attract and retain talented employees across many of our business and support areas. This competition leads to increased expenses in many business areas and can also cause us to not pursue certain business opportunities.  A failure to adequately address the competitive pressures we face could make it harder for us to attract and retain customers across our businesses. On the other hand, meeting these competitive pressures could require us to incur significant additional expense or to accept risk beyond what we would otherwise view as desirable under the circumstances. In addition, in our interest rate sensitive businesses, pressures to increase rates on deposits or decrease rates on loans could reduce our net interest margin with a resulting negative impact on our net interest income.  Our business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, natural or otherwise, by terrorist activities or by international hostilities.  Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, explosions, and other severe weather conditions or catastrophic accidents), terrorist activities and international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could impact us directly (for example, by causing significant damage to our facilities or preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course), or indirectly as a result of their impact on our borrowers, depositors, other customers, suppliers or other counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region. These types of impacts could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.         The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K 23   Table of Contents  Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning, and our ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of disasters or terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, particularly those that we depend upon but have no control over.
