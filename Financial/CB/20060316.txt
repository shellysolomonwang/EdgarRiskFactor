ITEM 1A. Risk Factors    Factors that could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition are outlined below. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem insignificant may also impair our business or results of operations as they become known facts or as facts and circumstances change. Any of the risks described below could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.    Our financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters.  We have substantial exposure to losses resulting from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes and other catastrophic events. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, typhoons, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, severe winter weather, fires, war, acts of terrorism, political instability and other natural or man-made disasters. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial. The occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in our results of operations or financial condition for any fiscal quarter or year. Increases in the values and concentrations of insured property may increase the severity of these occurrences in the future. Although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls and purchase of third-party reinsurance, catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable and the actual nature of such events when they occur could be more frequent or severe than contemplated in our pricing and risk management expectations. As a result, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Refer to “Catastrophe Exposure Management” and “Catastrophe Loss Charges” under Item 7 for more information.    If actual claims exceed our loss reserves, our financial results could be significantly adversely affected.  Our results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to assess accurately the potential losses associated with the risks that we insure and reinsure. We establish reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses, which are estimates of future payments of reported and unreported claims for losses and related expenses, with respect to insured events that have occurred at or prior to the date of the balance sheet. The process of establishing reserves is highly complex and is subject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors, and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methodologies are developed or as current laws or interpretations thereof change.  We have actuarial staff in each of our operating segments who analyze insurance reserves and regularly evaluate the levels of loss reserves. Any such evaluations could result in future changes in estimates of losses or reinsurance recoverable and would be reflected in our results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. Reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses represent the estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses less paid losses and loss expenses, and is comprised of case reserves and IBNR. During the loss settlement period, which can be many years in duration for some of our lines of business, additional facts regarding individual claims and trends often will become known. As these become apparent, case reserves may be adjusted by allocation from IBNR without any change in overall reserves. In addition, application of statistical and actuarial methods may require the adjustment of overall reserves upward or downward from time to time.  Included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are liabilities for latent claims such as A&E. These claims are principally related to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily-injury claims related to exposure to asbestos products and environmental hazards. The estimation of these liabilities is sub -   22       ject to many complex variables including the current legal environment, specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims; assumptions regarding multiple recoveries by claimants against various defendants; the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure; the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to non-products coverage; whether high-level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholder’s claim trends and liability situation; payments to unimpaired claimants and the potential liability of peripheral defendants.  Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses may be significantly greater or less than the loss and loss expense reserves held at the date of the balance sheet. If our loss reserves are determined to be inadequate, we will be required to increase loss reserves at the time of such determination and our net income will be reduced. If the increase in loss reserves is large enough, we could incur an operating loss and a reduction of our capital. Refer to “Asbestos and Environmental Liabilities”, under Item 7 and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.    The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.  As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the frequency and severity of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued.    The failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.  We seek to limit our loss exposure by writing a number of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis. Excess of loss insurance and reinsurance indemnifies the insured against losses in excess of a specified amount. In addition, we limit program size for each client and purchase third-party reinsurance for our own account. In the case of our assumed proportional reinsurance treaties, we seek per occurrence limitations or loss and loss expense ratio caps to limit the impact of losses ceded by the client. In proportional reinsurance, the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the premiums and losses of the reinsured. We also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification. Geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments, including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone’s limits. Various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. As a result, one or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.    We may be unable to purchase reinsurance, and if we successfully purchase reinsurance, we are subject to the possibility of non-payment.  We purchase reinsurance to protect certain ACE companies against catastrophes, to increase the amount of protection we can provide our clients and as part of our overall risk management strategy. Our reinsurance business also purchases some retrocessional protection. A retrocessional reinsurance agreement allows a reinsurer to cede to another company all or part of the reinsurance that was originally assumed by the reinsurer. A reinsurer’s or retrocessionairre’s insolvency, or inability or refusal to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us, could have a material adverse effect on us because we remain liable to the insured. From time to time, market conditions have limited, and in some cases have prevented, insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs.  There is no guarantee our desired amounts of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance will be available in the marketplace in the future. In addition to capacity risk, the remaining capacity may not be on terms we deem appropriate or acceptable or with companies we want to do business with. Finally, we face some degree of counter-party risk whenever we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance. Consequently, the insolvency, inability or reluctance of any of our present or future reinsurers to make timely payments to us under the terms of our reinsurance or retrocessional agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. At December 31, 2005, we had $15.5 billion of reinsurance recoverables, net of reserves for uncollectible recoverables.    23      As part of the restructuring of INA Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries that occurred in 1996, Insurance Company of North America (INA) was divided into two separate corporations: an active insurance company that retained the INA name and continued to write P&C business and an inactive run-off company, now called Century Indemnity Company (Century). The A&E exposures of substantially all of CIGNA’s U.S. P&C companies, now our subsidiaries, were either allocated to Century (as a result of the restructuring) or reinsured to subsidiaries of Brandywine, primarily Century. Certain of our subsidiaries are primarily liable for A&E and other exposures they have reinsured to Century. As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate reinsurance balances ceded by our active subsidiaries to Century were $1.6 billion. Should Century’s loss reserves experience adverse development in the future and should Century be placed into rehabilitation or liquidation, the reinsurance recoverables due to Century’s affiliates would be payable only after the payment in full of certain expenses and liabilities, including administrative expenses and direct policy liabilities. Thus, the intercompany reinsurance recoverables would be at risk to the extent of the shortage of assets remaining to pay these recoverables. While we believe the intercompany reinsurance recoverables from Century are not impaired at this time, we cannot assure you that adverse development with respect to Century’s loss reserves will not result in Century’s insolvency, which could result in our recognizing a loss to the extent of any uncollectible reinsurance from Century. For further information regarding our reinsurance exposure to Century, refer to “Asbestos and Environmental Liabilities”, under Item 7.    A decline in our ratings could affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease.  Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. The objective of these rating systems is to provide an opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders. Our financial strength ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of our financial strength, are not evaluations directed to investors in our securities and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. If our financial strength ratings are reduced from their current levels by one or more of these agencies, our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products. A downgrade, therefore, could result in a substantial loss of business as insureds, ceding companies and brokers move to other insurers and reinsurers with higher ratings. We cannot give any assurance regarding whether or to what extent any of the rating agencies may downgrade our ratings in the future.    We could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key executives or by an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel.  Our success depends on our ability to retain the services of our existing key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. The loss of the services of any of our key executives or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. We do not maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to our employees.  Many of our senior executives working in Bermuda, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Accounting Officer and our General Counsel, are not Bermudian. Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians (other than spouses of Bermudians and holders of permanent resident’s certificates) may not engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit. Our success may depend in part on the continued services of key employees in Bermuda. A work permit may be granted or renewed upon showing that, after proper public advertisement, no Bermudian (or spouse of a Bermudian or holder of a permanent resident’s certificate) is available who meets the minimum standards reasonably required by the employer. The Bermuda government’s policy places a six-year term limit on individuals with work permits, subject to certain exemptions for key employees. A work permit may be issued with an expiry date that is between one to five years and no assurances can be given that any work permit will be issued or, if issued, renewed upon the expiration of the relevant term.    Since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues, loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us.  We market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers. Marsh, Inc. and its affiliates and Aon Corporation and its affiliates provided approximately 16 percent and 13 percent, respectively, of our gross premiums written in the year ended December 31, 2005. Loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business.    24      Our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk.  In accordance with industry practice, we generally pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts to brokers, and these brokers, in turn, pay these amounts over to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us. Although the law is unsettled and depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case, in some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such a payment, we might remain liable to the insured or ceding insurer for the deficiency. Conversely, in certain jurisdictions, when the insured or ceding insurer pays premiums for these policies to brokers for payment over to us, these premiums might be considered to have been paid and the insured or ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts, whether or not we have actually received the premiums from the broker. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers with whom we transact business. However, due to the unsettled and fact-specific nature of the law, we are unable to quantify our exposure to this risk. To date, we have not experienced any material losses related to these credit risks.    Our investment performance may affect our financial results and ability to conduct business.  Our funds are invested by professional investment management firms under the direction of our management team in accordance with investment guidelines approved by the Finance and Investment Committee of the Board of Directors. Although our investment guidelines stress diversification of risks and conservation of principal and liquidity, our investments are subject to market risks, as well as risks inherent to individual securities. The volatility of our loss claims may force us to liquidate securities, which may cause us to incur capital losses. Investment losses could significantly decrease our book value, thereby affecting our ability to conduct business.    We may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.  Our operating results are affected by the performance of our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio contains fixed income investments and may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Volatility in interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our investment income and operating results. For example, if interest rates decline, funds reinvested will earn less than the maturing investment.  Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including monetary and fiscal policies, domestic and international political conditions. Although we take measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to effectively mitigate interest rate sensitivity. Our mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value. A significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our book value.    We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms.  Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. We may need to raise additional funds through financings. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders could result, and in any case such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our ordinary shares. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.    Our operating results may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations.  Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Many of our non-U.S. companies maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies. Therefore, foreign exchange risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies. Foreign exchange risk is reviewed as part of our risk management process. Locally required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements, and to support local insurance operations. The principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk are the British pound sterling, the Euro and the Canadian dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2005, approximately eight percent of our net assets were denominated in foreign currencies. We may experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of non-U.S. currencies, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.    25      The regulatory regimes under which we operate, and potential changes thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries conduct business in over 50 countries around the world as well as all 50 states of the United States. Our businesses in each of these jurisdictions are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision. The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled require, among other things that, these subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of statutory capital, surplus and liquidity, meet solvency standards and submit to periodic examinations of their financial condition . These laws and regulations also sometimes restrict payments of dividends and reductions of capital. These statutes, regulations and policies may also restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to write insurance and reinsurance policies, to make certain investments and to distribute funds. The purpose of insurance laws and regulations generally is to protect insureds and ceding insurance companies, not our shareholders. We may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain appropriate exemptions from, these statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate authorizations and/or exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or undertake activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business and could subject us to fines and other sanctions. In addition, changes in the laws or regulations to which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business.    Current legal and regulatory activities relating to insurance brokers and agents, contingent commissions and certain finite-risk insurance products could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  ACE has received numerous subpoenas, interrogatories, and civil investigative demands in connection with the pending investigations of insurance industry practices. These inquiries have been issued by a number of attorneys general, state departments of insurance, and state and federal regulatory authorities, including the NYAG, the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. ACE is cooperating and will continue to cooperate with such inquiries. We cannot assure you that we will not receive any additional requests for information or subpoenas or what action, if any, any of these governmental agencies will take as a result of these investigations. Additionally, at this time, we are unable to predict the potential effects, if any, that these investigations may have upon the insurance and reinsurance markets and industry business practices or what, if any, changes may be made to laws and regulations regarding the industry and financial reporting. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Numerous lawsuits, including putative class actions lawsuits, have been filed by policyholders and security holders; refer to Note 7 e) of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Because these suits seek compensatory damages without specifying an amount, and given the procedural and substantive defenses to these claims, ACE cannot at this time estimate its potential exposure related to these legal matters and accordingly no liability for compensatory damages has been established in ACE’s consolidated financial statements.    Events may result in political, regulatory and industry initiatives, which could adversely affect our business.  Government intervention has occurred in the insurance and reinsurance markets in relation to terrorism coverage both in the U.S. and through industry initiatives in other countries. TRIA, which was enacted to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts in the U.S., will expire on December 31, 2007 and there can be no assurance that it will be extended beyond that date or as to the terms of any such extension. Refer to “Regulation – U.S. Operations” for more information.  Government intervention and the possibility of future interventions have created uncertainty in the insurance and reinsurance markets about the definition of terrorist acts and the extent to which future coverages will extend to terrorist acts. Government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of other constituencies, including shareholders of insurers and reinsurers. While we cannot predict the exact nature, timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives, such proposals could adversely affect our business by:  • providing insurance and reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target;  • requiring our participation in industry pools and guaranty associations;  • expanding the scope of coverage under existing policies;  • regulating the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies; or  • disproportionately benefiting the companies of one country over those of another.    26      The insurance industry is also affected by political, judicial and legal developments that may create new and expanded theories of liability. Such changes may result in delays or cancellations of products and services by insurers and reinsurers, which could adversely affect our business.    Our ability to pay dividends and to make payments on indebtedness may be constrained by our holding company structure.  ACE Limited is a holding company and does not have any significant operations or assets other than its ownership of the shares of its operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. Dividends and other permitted distributions from our insurance subsidiaries are our primary source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements, including any future debt service payments and other expenses, and to pay dividends to our shareholders. Some of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends. The inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and/or meet our debt service obligations.    ACE Limited is a Cayman Islands company with headquarters in Bermuda; it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against it or its directors and executive officers.  ACE Limited is incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Cayman Islands and our principal executive offices are located in Bermuda. In addition, certain of our directors and officers reside outside the United States, and all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located in jurisdictions outside the United States. As such, it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the United States upon those persons or to recover against us or them on judgments of U.S. courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.  ACE has been advised by Maples and Calder, its Cayman Islands counsel, that there is doubt as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands would enforce:  • judgments of U.S. courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. Federal securities laws obtained in actions against ACE or its directors and officers, who reside outside the United States; or  • original actions brought in the Cayman Islands against these persons or ACE predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws.  ACE has also been advised by Maples and Calder that there is no treaty in effect between the United States and the Cayman Islands providing for this enforcement, and there are grounds upon which Cayman Islands courts may not enforce judgments of United States courts. Some remedies available under the laws of United States jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. Federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Cayman Islands courts as contrary to that nation’s public policy.    Competition in the insurance industry could reduce our margins.  The insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We compete on an international and regional basis with major U.S., Bermuda, European and other international insurers and reinsurers and with underwriting syndicates, some of which have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do. We also compete with new companies that continue to be formed to enter the insurance and reinsurance markets. In addition, capital market participants have recently created alternative products that are intended to compete with reinsurance products. Increased competition could result in fewer submissions, lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions, which could reduce our margins.    The insurance and reinsurance business is historically cyclical, and we expect to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates.  The insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels. An increase in premium levels is often offset by an increasing supply of insurance and reinsurance capacity, either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or reinsurers, which may cause prices to decrease. Any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms and fewer submissions for our underwriting services. In addition to these considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance business significantly.    27      There are provisions in our charter documents that may reduce or increase the voting rights of our ordinary shares.  Our articles of association generally provide that shareholders have one vote for each ordinary share held by them and are entitled to vote, on a non-cumulative basis, at all meetings of shareholders. However, the voting rights exercisable by a shareholder may be limited so that certain persons or groups are not deemed to hold 10 percent or more of the voting power conferred by our ordinary shares. Under these provisions, some shareholders may have the right to exercise their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share. Moreover, these provisions could have the effect of reducing the voting power of some shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership. In addition, our board of directors may limit a shareholder’s exercise of voting rights where it deems it necessary to do so to avoid adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequences.  We also have the authority under our articles of association to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholder’s voting rights are to be limited pursuant to our articles of association. If a shareholder fails to respond to our request for information or submits incomplete or inaccurate information in response to a request by us, we may, in our sole discretion, eliminate the shareholder’s voting rights.    There are provisions in our articles of association which may restrict the ability to transfer ordinary shares and which may require shareholders to sell their ordinary shares.  Our board of directors may decline to register a transfer of any ordinary shares under some circumstances, including if they have reason to believe that any non-de minimis adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to us, any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders may occur as a result of such transfer. Our articles of association also provide that if our board of directors determines that share ownership by a person may result in non-de minimis adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequences to us, any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders, then we have the option, but not the obligation, to require that shareholder to sell to us or to third parties to whom we assign the repurchase right for fair market value the minimum number of ordinary shares held by such person which is necessary to eliminate the non-de minimis adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequences.    Applicable laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company.  Before a person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, the state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity and management of the applicant’s board of directors and executive officers, the acquiror’s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. Generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, ten percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer. Because a person acquiring ten percent or more of our ordinary shares would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of various U.S. jurisdictions would likely apply to such a transaction.  We and certain of our UK subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Council of Lloyd’s. Lloyd’s imposes an absolute prohibition on any person being a ten percent controller of a corporate member without first notifying Lloyd’s and receiving their consent. Because a person acquiring ten percent or more of our ordinary shares would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our subsidiary that is a Lloyd’s corporate member, the Lloyd’s restrictions on becoming a controller of a corporate member would likely apply to such a transaction.  Laws of other jurisdiction in which one or more of our existing subsidiaries is, or a future subsidiary may be, organized or domiciled may contain similar restrictions on the acquisition of control of ACE.  While our articles of association limit the voting power of any shareholder to less than ten percent, there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory body would agree that a shareholder who owned ten percent or more of our ordinary shares did not, because of the limitation on the voting power of such shares, control the applicable insurance subsidiary.  These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company, including transactions that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable.    28      U.S. persons who own our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than U.S. persons who are shareholders of a U.S. corporation.  The Companies Law (2004 Revision), of the Cayman Islands which applies to us, differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers.    Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could impede an attempt to replace our directors or to effect a change of control, which could diminish the value of our ordinary shares.  Our articles of association contain provisions that may make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors and could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable. These provisions include a staggered board of directors, limitations on the ability of shareholders to remove directors other than for cause, limitations on voting rights and restrictions on transfer of our ordinary shares. These provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our ordinary shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our ordinary shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.    We may become subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 28, 2016, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and your investment.  The Bermuda Minister of Finance, under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda, as amended, has given each of ACE Limited and its Bermuda insurance subsidiaries a written assurance that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to those companies or any of their respective operations, shares, debentures or other obligations until March 28, 2016, except insofar as such tax applies to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda or is payable by us in respect of real property owned or leased by us in Bermuda. Given the limited duration of the Minister of Finance’s assurance, we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any Bermuda tax after March 28, 2016.    We may become subject to taxes in the Cayman Islands after January 31, 2026, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and your investment.  Under current Cayman Islands law, we are not obligated to pay any taxes in the Cayman Islands on our income or gains. We have received an undertaking from the Governor-in-Council of the Cayman Islands pursuant to the provisions of the Tax Concessions Law, as amended, that until January 31, 2026, (i) no subsequently enacted law imposing any tax on profits, income, gains or appreciation shall apply to us and (ii) no such tax and no tax in the nature of an estate duty or an inheritance tax shall be payable on any of our ordinary shares, debentures or other obligations. Under current law, no tax will be payable on the transfer or other disposition of our ordinary shares. The Cayman Islands currently impose stamp duties on certain categories of documents; however, our current operations do not involve the payment of stamp duties in any material amount. The Cayman Islands also currently impose an annual corporate fee upon all exempted companies incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Given the limited duration of the undertaking from the Governor-in-Council of the Cayman Islands, we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any Cayman Islands tax after January 31, 2026.    Our Bermuda-based subsidiaries may become subject to U.S. tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and your investment.  ACE Limited, ACE Bermuda Insurance Ltd., ACE Tempest Reinsurance Ltd. and our other Bermuda-based insurance subsidiaries operate in a manner so that none of these companies should be subject to U.S. tax (other than U.S. excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring U.S. risks and U.S. withholding tax on some types of U.S. source investment income), because none of these companies should be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States. However, because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the United States, we cannot be certain that the IRS will not contend successfully that any of ACE Limited or its Bermuda-based subsidiaries is/are engaged in a trade or business in the United States. If ACE Limited or any of its Bermuda-based subsidiaries were considered to be engaged in     29       a trade or business in the United States, such entity could be subject to U.S. corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such U.S. business, in which case its results of operations and your investment could be materially adversely affected.    If you acquire ten percent or more of ACE Limited’s shares, you may be subject to taxation under the “controlled foreign corporation” (the CFC) rules.  Under certain circumstances, a U.S. person who owns ten percent or more of the voting power of a foreign corporation that is a CFC (a foreign corporation in which ten percent U.S. shareholders own more than 50 percent of the voting power of the foreign corporation or more than 25 percent of a foreign insurance company) for an uninterrupted period of 30 days or more during a taxable year must include in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes such “10 percent U.S. Shareholder’s” pro rata share of the CFC’s “subpart F income,” even if the subpart F income is not distributed to such 10 percent U.S. Shareholder if such 10 percent U.S. Shareholder owns (directly or indirectly through foreign entities) any of our shares on the last day of our taxable year. “Subpart F income” of a foreign insurance corporation typically includes foreign personal holding company income (such as interest, dividends and other types of passive income), as well as insurance and reinsurance income (including underwriting and investment income) attributable to the insurance of risks situated outside the CFC’s country of incorporation.  We believe that because of the dispersion of our share ownership, provisions in our organizational documents that limit voting power and other factors, no U.S. Person or U.S. Partnership who acquires shares of ACE Limited directly or indirectly through one or more foreign entities should be required to include our “subpart F income” in income under the CFC rules of the Code. It is possible, however, that the IRS could challenge the effectiveness of these provisions and that a court could sustain such a challenge, in which case your investment could be materially adversely affected, if you own ten percent or more of ACE Limited’s stock.    U.S. Persons who hold shares may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation at ordinary income rates on their proportionate share of our RPII.  If the RPII of any of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries (each a “Non-U.S. Insurance Subsidiary”) excluding those Non-U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries that are CFCs were to equal or exceed 20 percent of that company’s gross insurance income in any taxable year and direct or indirect insureds (and persons related to those insureds) own directly or indirectly through entities 20 percent or more of the voting power or value of ACE Limited, then a U.S. Person who owns any shares of ACE Limited (directly or indirectly through foreign entities) on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in its income for U.S. federal income tax purposes such person’s pro rata share of such company’s RPII for the entire taxable year, determined as if such RPII were distributed proportionately only to U.S. Persons at that date regardless of whether such income is distributed. In addition, any RPII that is includible in the income of a U.S. tax-exempt organization may be treated as unrelated business taxable income. We believe that the gross RPII of each Non-U.S. Insurance Subsidiary did not in prior years of operation and is not expected in the foreseeable future to equal or exceed 20 percent of each such company’s gross insurance income, and we do not expect the direct or indirect insureds of each Non-U.S. Insurance Subsidiary (and persons related to such insureds) to directly or indirectly own 20 percent or more of either the voting power or value of our shares, but we cannot be certain that this will be the case because some of the factors which determine the extent of RPII may be beyond our control. If these thresholds are met or exceeded, and if you are an affected U.S. Person, your investment could be materially adversely affected.    U.S. Persons who hold shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered to be a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  If ACE Limited is considered a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Person who owns any shares of ACE Limited will be subject to adverse tax consequences, including subjecting the investor to a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply and subjecting the investor to tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed, in which case your investment could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if ACE Limited were considered a PFIC, upon the death of any U.S. individual owning shares, such individual’s heirs or estate would not be entitled to a “step-up” in the basis of the shares which might otherwise be available under U.S. federal income tax laws. We believe that we are not, have not been, and currently do not expect to become, a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We cannot assure you, however, that we will not be deemed a PFIC by the IRS. If we were considered a PFIC, it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation. There are     30       currently no regulations regarding the application of the PFIC provisions to an insurance company. New regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such guidance would have on an investor that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation.    U.S. tax-exempt organizations who own our shares may recognize unrelated business taxable income.  A U.S. tax-exempt organization may recognize unrelated business taxable income if a portion of our insurance income is allocated to the organization, which generally would be the case if either we are a CFC and the tax-exempt shareholder is a ten percent U.S. Shareholder or there is RPII, certain exceptions do not apply and the tax-exempt organization, directly or indirectly through foreign entities, owns any shares of ACE Limited. Although we do not believe that any U.S. Persons or U.S. Partnerships should be allocated such insurance income, we cannot be certain that this will be the case. Potential U.S. tax-exempt investors are advised to consult their tax advisors.    Changes in U.S. federal income tax law could materially adversely affect an investment in our shares.  Legislation is periodically introduced in the U.S. Congress intended to eliminate some perceived tax advantages of companies (including insurance companies) that have legal domiciles outside the United States but have certain U.S. connections. While there are no currently pending legislative proposals which, if enacted, would have a material adverse effect on us or our shareholders, it is possible that legislative proposals could emerge in the future that could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders.    The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union are considering measures that might encourage countries to increase our taxes.  A number of multinational organizations, including the European Union, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Financial Action Task Force and the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) have, in recent years, identified some countries as not participating in adequate information exchange, engaging in harmful tax practices or not maintaining adequate controls to prevent corruption, such as money laundering activities. Recommendations to limit such harmful practices are under consideration by these organizations, and a report published on November 27, 2001 by the OECD at the behest of FSF titled “Behind the Corporate Veil: Using Corporate Entities for Illicit Purposes,” contains an extensive discussion of specific recommendations. The OECD has threatened non-member jurisdictions that do not agree to cooperate with the OECD with punitive sanctions by OECD member countries, though specific sanctions have yet to be adopted by OECD member countries. It is as yet unclear what these sanctions will be, who will adopt them and when or if they will be imposed. In an April 18, 2002 report, updated as of June 2004, Bermuda was not listed as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction by the OECD because it previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency, exchange of information, and the elimination of regimes for financial and other services that attract businesses with no substantial domestic activity. We cannot assure you, however, that the action taken by Bermuda would be sufficient to preclude all effects of the measures or sanctions described above, which, if ultimately adopted, could adversely affect Bermuda companies such as us.
