Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our business involves various risks and uncertainties that may affect achievement of our business objectives. Many of the risks could have ramifications across our integrated business activities. For example, while risks related to setting insurance rates and establishing and adjusting loss reserves are insurance activities, errors in these areas could have an impact on our investment activities, growth and overall results. The following discussion should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks we face. It is not a definitive summary of their potential impact or of our strategies to manage and control the risks. Please see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Page 32, for a discussion of those strategies.  The risks and uncertainties below are not the only ones we face. There are additional risks and uncertainties that we currently do not believe are material at this time. There also may be risks and uncertainties of which we are not aware. If any risks or uncertainties discussed here develop into actual events, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline materially.  Readers should carefully consider this information together with the other information we have provided in this report and in other reports and materials we file periodically with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as news releases and other information we disseminate publicly.  We rely exclusively on independent insurance agents to distribute our products.  We market our products through independent, non-exclusive insurance agents. These agents are not obligated to promote our products and can and do sell our competitors’ products. We must offer insurance products that meet the needs of these agencies and their clients. We need to maintain good relationships with the agencies that market our products. If we do not, these agencies may market our competitors’ products instead of ours, which may lead to us having a less desirable mix of business and could affect our results of operations.  Events or conditions that could diminish our agents’ desire to produce business for us and the competitive advantage that our independent agencies enjoy:     •   Downgrade of the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. We believe our strong insurer financial strength ratings, in particular the A++ (Excellent) rating from A.M. Best of our standard market property casualty insurance subsidiaries, are an important competitive advantage. Only 16 other insurance groups, or 1.6 percent of all rated insurance groups, qualify for the A++, A.M. Best’s highest rating. If our property casualty ratings are downgraded, our agents might find it more difficult to market our products or might choose to emphasize the products of other carriers.       •   Concerns that doing business with us is difficult, perceptions that our level of service is no longer a distinguishing characteristic in the marketplace or perceptions that our business practices are not compatible with agents’ business models. This could occur if agents or policyholders believe that we are no longer providing the prompt, reliable personal service that has long been a distinguishing characteristic of our insurance operations.       •   Delays in the development, implementation, performance and benefits of technology projects and enhancements or independent agent perceptions that our technology solutions are inadequate to match their needs.    A reduction in the number of independent agencies marketing our products, the failure of agencies to successfully market our products or the choice of agencies to reduce their writings of our products could affect our results of operations if we are unable to replace them with agencies that produce adequate and profitable premiums.  Further, policyholders may choose a competitor’s product rather than our own because of real or perceived differences in price, terms and conditions, coverage or service. If the quality of the independent agencies with which we do business were to decline, that also might cause policyholders to purchase their insurance through different agencies or channels. Consumers, especially in the personal insurance segments, may increasingly choose to purchase insurance from distribution channels other than independent insurance agents, such as direct marketers.  Please see Item 1, Our Business and Our Strategy, Page 1, for a discussion of our relationships with independent insurance agents.  Our ability to properly underwrite and price risks and increased competition could adversely affect our results.  Our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. We establish our pricing based on assumptions regarding the level of losses that will occur within classes of business, geographic regions and other criteria.  Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2007 Annual Report on 10-K - Page 21    Table of Contents  To properly price our products, we must collect and properly analyze data, the data must be sufficient, reliable and accessible, we need to develop appropriate rating methodologies and formulae, and identify and respond to trends quickly. If rates are not accurate, we may not generate enough premiums to offset losses and expenses or we may not be competitive in the marketplace.  Setting appropriate rates could be hampered if a state or states where we write business refuses to allow rate increases that we believe are necessary to cover the risks insured. At least one state requires us to purchase reinsurance from a mandatory reinsurance fund. Such reinsurance funds can create a credit risk for insurers if not adequately funded by the state and, in some cases, the existence of a reinsurance fund could affect the prices charged for our policies. The effect of these and similar arrangements could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business.  The insurance industry is cyclical and intensely competitive. From time to time, the insurance industry goes through prolonged periods of intense competition during which it is more difficult to attract new business, retain existing business and maintain profitability. Competition in our insurance business is based on many factors, including:     •   Competitiveness of premiums charged       •   Relationships among carriers, agents, brokers and policyholders       •   Underwriting and pricing methodologies that allow insurers to identify and flexibly price risks       •   Compensation provided to agents       •   Underwriting discipline       •   Terms and conditions of insurance coverage       •   Speed at which products are brought to market       •   Technological innovation       •   Ability to control expenses       •   Adequacy of financial strength ratings by independent ratings agencies such as A.M. Best       •   Quality of services provided to agents and policyholders       •   Claims satisfaction and reputation    If our pricing is incorrect or we are unable to compete effectively because of one or more of these factors, our premium writings could decline and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  Please see Item 7, Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Life Insurance Results of Operations, Page 44, Page 51, and Page 56, for a discussion of our competitive position in the insurance marketplace.  Managing technology initiatives and meeting new data security requirements are significant challenges.  While technology can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives present short-term cost, implementation and operational risks. In addition, we may have inaccurate expense projections, implementation schedules or expectations regarding the efficacy of the end product. These issues could escalate over time. If we are unable to find and retain employees with key technical knowledge, our ability to develop and deploy key technology solutions could be hampered.  We necessarily collect, use and hold data concerning individuals and businesses with whom we have a relationship. Threats to data security rapidly emerge and change, exposing us to rising costs and competing time constraints to secure our data in accordance with customer expectations and statutory and regulatory requirements. A breach of our security that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, significant increases in compliance costs and reputational damage.  Please see Item 1, Technology Solutions, Page 4 for a discussion of our technology initiatives.  The effects of changes in industry practices and regulations on our business are uncertain.  As industry practices and legal, judicial, regulatory, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to insurance pricing, claims, and coverage, may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by impeding our ability to obtain adequate rates for covered risks, extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, unforeseeable emerging and latent claim and coverage issues may not become apparent until some time after we have issued the insurance policies that could be affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a policy is issued.  Further, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and state insurance regulators are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations governing insurance companies and insurance holding  Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2007 Annual Report on 10-K - Page 22    Table of Contents  companies, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations that affect a variety of financial and nonfinancial components of our business. Any proposed or future legislation or NAIC initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs.  The effects of such changes could adversely affect our results of operations.  Please see Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty and Life Insurance Reserves, Page 37, for a discussion of our reserving practices.  Our loss reserves, our largest liability, are based on estimates and could be inadequate to cover our actual losses.  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared using GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. For a discussion of the significant accounting policies we use to prepare our financial statements and the material implications of uncertainties associated with the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying our critical accounting policies, please refer to Item 8, Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 87, and Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty and Life Insurance Reserves, Page 37.  Our most critical accounting estimate is loss reserves. Loss reserves are the amounts we expect to pay for covered claims and expenses we incur to settle those claims. The loss reserves we establish in our financial statements represent an estimate of amounts needed to pay and administer claims arising from insured events that have occurred, including events that have not yet been reported to us. Loss reserves are estimates and are inherently uncertain; they do not and cannot represent an exact measure of liability. Accordingly, our loss reserves for past periods could prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses and related expenses. Any changes in these estimates are reflected in our results of operations during the period in which the changes are made. An increase in our loss reserves would decrease earnings, while a decrease in our loss reserves would increase earnings.  The estimation process for unpaid loss and loss expense obligations involves uncertainty by its very nature. We continually review the estimates and adjust the reserves as facts regarding individual claims develop, additional losses are reported and new information becomes known. Adjustments due to loss development on prior years are reflected in the calendar year in which they are identified. The process used to determine our loss reserves is discussed in Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty and Life Insurance Reserves, Page 37.  Unforeseen losses, the type and magnitude of which we cannot predict, may emerge in the future. These additional losses could arise from changes in the legal environment, catastrophic events, increases in loss severity or frequency, or other causes. Such future losses could be substantial.  We could experience an unusually high level of losses due to catastrophic or terrorism events or risk concentrations.  In the normal course of our business, we provide coverage against perils for which estimates of losses are highly uncertain, in particular catastrophic and terrorism events. Catastrophes can be caused by a number of events, including hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, severe winter weather and fires. Due to the nature of these events, we are unable to predict precisely the frequency or potential cost of catastrophe occurrences. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event.  We have natural catastrophe exposure to:     •   Hurricanes in the gulf and southeastern coastal regions.       •   Earthquakes in the New Madrid fault zone, which lies within the central Mississippi valley, extending from northeast Arkansas through southeast Missouri, western Tennessee and western Kentucky to southern Illinois, southern Indiana and parts of Ohio.       •   Tornado, wind and hail in the Midwest and Southeast and, to a certain extent, the mid-Atlantic.    The occurrence of terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. While we do insure terrorism risk in all areas we serve, we have identified our major terrorism exposure as general commercial risks in the metropolitan Chicago area as well as small co-op utilities, small shopping malls and small colleges throughout our 34 active states. Additionally, our life insurance subsidiary could be adversely affected in the event of a terrorist event or an epidemic such as the avian flu, particularly if the epidemic were to affect a broad range of the population beyond just the very young or the very old. Our associate health plan is self-funded and could similarly be affected.  Our results of operations would be adversely affected if the level of losses we experienced over a period of time exceeded our actuarially determined expectations. In addition, our financial condition would be adversely  Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2007 Annual Report on 10-K - Page 23    Table of Contents  affected if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity or at unfavorable prices to pay an unusually high level of loss and loss expenses. Securities pricing might be even less favorable if a number of insurance companies needed to sell securities during a short period of time because of unusually high losses from catastrophic events.  Our geographic concentration ties our performance to business, economic, environmental and regulatory conditions in certain states. We market our property casualty insurance product in 34 states, but our business is concentrated in the Midwest and Southeast. We also have exposure in states where we do not actively market insurance when clients of our independent agencies have business or properties in multiple states.  The Cincinnati Insurance Company also participates in three assumed reinsurance treaties with two reinsurers that spread the risk of very high catastrophe losses among many insurers. In 2008, we have exposure of up to $7 million of assumed losses in three layers, from $1.0 billion to $1.7 billion, from a single event under an assumed reinsurance treaty for Munich Re Group. The other two assumed reinsurance treaties are immaterial.  In the event of a severe catastrophic event or terrorist attack elsewhere in the world, our insurance losses may be immaterial. However, the companies in which we invest might be severely affected, which could affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our reinsurers might experience significant losses, potentially jeopardizing their ability to pay losses we cede to them. A catastrophe or epidemic event also could affect our operations by damaging our headquarters facility or disrupting our associates’ ability to perform their assigned tasks.  Please see Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty and Life Insurance Reserves, Page 37, for a discussion of our reserving practices.  Our ability to obtain or collect on our reinsurance protection could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We buy property casualty and life reinsurance coverage to mitigate the liquidity risk of an unexpected rise in claims severity or frequency from catastrophic events or a single large loss. The availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly. If we are unable to obtain reinsurance on acceptable terms and in appropriate amounts, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.  In addition, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. Although we purchase reinsurance to manage our risks and exposures to losses, this reinsurance does not discharge our direct obligations under the policies we write. We would remain liable to our policyholders even if we were unable to recover what we believe we are entitled to receive under our reinsurance contracts. Reinsurers might refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them, or they might delay payment. For long-term cases, the creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we can recover amounts to which we are entitled. A reinsurer’s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with our insurance subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Prior to 2003, we participated in USAIG, a joint underwriting association of individual insurance companies that collectively functions as a worldwide insurance market for all types of aviation and aerospace accounts. At year-end 2007, 29.8 percent, or $225 million, of our total reinsurance receivables were related to USAIG, primarily for September 11, 2001, events. Although more than 99 percent of the reinsurance recoverables associated with USAIG are backed by securities on deposit, if we are unable to collect these receivables, our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected. We no longer participate in new business generated by USAIG and its members.  Please see Item 7, 2008 Reinsurance Programs, Page 70, for a discussion of our reinsurance treaties.  Our ability to realize our investment objectives could affect our financial condition, our results of operations or cash flows.  We invest premiums received from policyholders and other available cash to generate investment income and capital appreciation, maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay covered claims and operating expenses, service our debt obligations and pay dividends. At year-end 2007, our investment portfolio was $12.198 billion, or 73.3 percent of our total assets. In 2007, our investment segment contributed 21.8 percent of our revenue and 78.0 percent of our total income before income taxes.  Investment income is an important component of our revenues and net income. The ability to achieve our investment objectives is affected by factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, economic growth, interest rates, world political conditions, terrorism attacks or threats, adverse events affecting other companies in our industry or the industries in which we invest and other widespread unpredictable events. These events may adversely affect the economy generally and could cause our investment income or the value of securities we own to decrease. A significant decline in our investment income could have an adverse effect on our net income, and thereby on our shareholders’ equity and our policyholders’ surplus. For more detailed discussion of risks associated with our investments, please refer to Item 7A, Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Page 73.  Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2007 Annual Report on 10-K - Page 24    Table of Contents  Our investment performance also could suffer because of the types or concentrations of investments, industry groups and/or individual securities in which we choose to invest. Market value changes related to these choices could cause a material change in our financial condition or results of operations.  At year-end 2007, common stock holdings made up 49.4 percent of our investment portfolio. Of those equities, 56.7 percent were in financial sector companies. Adverse news or events affecting equities, and this sector specifically, such as unfavorable developments related to subprime lending, could affect our net income, book value and overall results.  One of our financial sector investments, Fifth Third, accounted for 28.5 percent of our shareholders’ equity at year-end 2007 and dividends earned from our Fifth Third investment were 20.0 percent of our investment income in 2007. Based on 2007 results, a 10 percent change in dividends earned from our Fifth Third holding would result in a $12 million change in pretax investment income and an $11 million change in after-tax earnings. Every $1.00 change in the market price of Fifth Third’s common stock has approximately a 26 cent impact on our book value per share. A 20 percent change in the market price of Fifth Third’s common stock from its year-end 2007 closing price would result in a $338 million change in assets and a $220 million change in after tax unrealized gains.  Because we currently own more than 10 percent of Fifth Third’s outstanding shares and because our CEO serves as a director of Fifth Third, we are limited in the amount of Fifth Third stock we could sell in any given period and the timing of any sale. This limitation could lead us to hold a sizeable position in Fifth Third even if it would no longer meet our investment parameters. This could result in a variety of adverse consequences depending on the reason we had concluded Fifth Third no longer met our investment parameters. For example, if Fifth Third were to stop paying dividends on its common stock, we would not be able to quickly sell a part of our holdings to reinvest in other income-earning investments, which would have a material effect on our results of operations. We also insure property, liability, surety and life insurance exposures for Fifth Third and rely on the bank to service many of our corporate accounts, associate payroll and 401(k) plan.  Please see Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 15, Item 7, Investments Results of Operations, Page 57, and Liquidity and Capital Resources, Page 60, for discussion of our investment activities.  Our status as an insurance holding company with no direct operations could affect our ability to pay dividends in the future.  Cincinnati Financial Corporation is a holding company that transacts substantially all of its business through its subsidiaries. Our primary assets are the stock in our operating subsidiaries and our investments. Consequently, our cash flow to pay cash dividends and interest on our long-term debt depends on dividends we receive from our operating subsidiaries and income earned on investments held at the parent-company level.  Dividends paid to us by our insurance subsidiary are restricted by the insurance laws of Ohio, its domiciliary state. These laws establish minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds and limits. Currently, the maximum dividend that may be paid without prior regulatory approval is limited to the greater of 10 percent of statutory surplus or 100 percent of statutory net income for the prior calendar year, up to the amount of statutory unassigned surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year. Dividends exceeding these limitations may be paid only with prior approval of the Ohio Department of Insurance. Consequently, at times, we might not be able to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiary or we might not receive dividends in the amounts necessary to meet our debt obligations or to pay dividends on our common stock. This could affect our financial position.  Please see Item 1, Regulation, Page 19, and Item 8, Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 96, for discussion of insurance holding company dividend regulations.  We could make investment decisions or experience market value fluctuations that trigger restrictions applicable to the parent company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  Compared with other insurance holding companies, we hold a significant level of investment assets at the parent company level. If these investment assets grow to account for more than 40 percent of parent company’s total assets, excluding assets of our subsidiaries, we might become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Our operations are limited by the constraint that investment securities held at the holding company level should remain below the 40 percent threshold described above. Efforts to stay below the threshold could result in:     •   Disposal of otherwise desirable investment securities, possibly under undesirable conditions. Such dispositions could result in a lower return on investment, loss of investment income, and if we were unable to manage the timing of the dispositions, we also might realize unnecessary capital gains, which would increase our annual tax payment.       •   Limited opportunities to purchase equity securities that hold the potential for market value appreciation, which could hamper book value growth over the long term.    Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2007 Annual Report on 10-K - Page 25    Table of Contents        •   Maintenance of a greater portion of our portfolio of equity securities at the insurance subsidiary, which would cause the parent to be more reliant on its subsidiaries for cash to fund parent-company obligations, including shareholder dividends and interest on long-term debt.    If the parent company’s investment assets were to exceed the 40 percent ratio to its total assets, excluding investment in its subsidiaries, and if it were determined that the holding company was an unregistered investment company, the holding company might be unable to enforce contracts with third parties, and third parties could seek rescission of transactions with the holding company undertaken during the period that it was an unregistered investment company, subject to equitable considerations set forth in the Investment Company Act. In addition, the holding company could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action brought by the SEC.  Our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions.  Our business depends on our associate’s ability to perform necessary business functions, such as processing new and renewal policies and claims. We increasingly rely on technology and systems to accomplish these business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion. Our inability to access our headquarters facilities or a failure of technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis or affect the accuracy of transactions. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption or system failure could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, serve our agents and policyholders, pay claims in a timely manner, collect receivables or perform other necessary business functions. If our disaster recovery and business continuity plans did not sufficiently consider, address or reverse the circumstances of an interruption or failure, this could result in a materially adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
