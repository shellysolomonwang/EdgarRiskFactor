Item 1A. Risk Factors.    This Report includes forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, Comerica may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements. All statements regarding Comerica's expected financial position, strategies and growth prospects and general economic conditions Comerica expects to exist in the future are forward-looking statements. The words, "anticipates," "believes," "feels," "expects," "estimates," "seeks," "strives," "plans," "intends," "outlook," "forecast," "position," "target," "mission," "assume," "achievable," "potential," "strategy," "goal," "aspiration," "outcome," "continue," "remain," "maintain," "trend," "objective" and variations of such words and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "would," "should," "could," "might," "can," "may" or  11      Table of Contents  similar expressions, as they relate to Comerica or its management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.   Comerica cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statement is made, and Comerica does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, assumptions or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, and future results could differ materially from historical performance.   In addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this Report or previously disclosed in Comerica's SEC reports (accessible on the SEC's website at  www.sec.gov or on Comerica's website at www.comerica.com), the factors contained below, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, and future results could differ materially from historical performance.   •General political, economic or industry conditions, either domestically or internationally, may be less favorable than expected.   Local, domestic, and international economic, political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry, directly and indirectly. Conditions such as or related to inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, international conflicts and other factors, such as real estate values, energy costs and fuel prices, outside of our control may, directly and indirectly, adversely affect Comerica. As has been the case with impact of recent economic conditions, economic downturns could result in the delinquency of outstanding loans, which could have a material adverse impact on Comerica's earnings.    •Governmental monetary and fiscal policies may adversely affect the financial services industry, and therefore impact Comerica's financial condition and results of operations.   Monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular the Federal Reserve Board, affect the financial services industry, directly and indirectly. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part Comerica's cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments. Changes in such policies, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the value of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits. Changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond Comerica's control and difficult to predict. Comerica's financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies.    •Volatility and disruptions in the functioning of the financial markets and related liquidity issues could continue or worsen and, therefore, may adversely impact Comerica's business, financial condition and results of operations.   The financial markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption in recent periods. The impact of this situation, together with concerns regarding the financial strength of financial institutions, has led to distress in financial markets and issues relating to liquidity among financial institutions. As a result of concern about the stability of the financial markets generally, the resulting credit availability issues, lack of confidence in the financial sector, increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could have a material adverse effect on Comerica's ability to access capital and manage liquidity. If current levels of financial market volatility and disruption continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that Comerica's business, financial condition and results of operations will not be materially and adversely impacted.   12                 Table of Contents   •Changes in the performance and creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties may adversely impact Comerica's business, financial condition and results of operations.   Current market developments and economic conditions have affected consumer confidence levels which may result in adverse changes in payment patterns of Comerica's customers. This market turmoil and the tightening of credit have led to an increased level of consumer and commercial delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence and widespread reduction of business activity generally. A worsening of these conditions would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on Comerica, Comerica's customers and others in the financial institutions industry. Increased delinquencies and default rates may impact Comerica's loan charge-offs and related provisioning for loan losses. Deterioration in the quality of its credit portfolio could have an adverse impact on Comerica's business, financial condition and results of operations.    •The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Comerica.   Comerica's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led, and may further lead, to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions could expose Comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. In addition, Comerica's credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to Comerica. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect, possible materially in nature, Comerica.    •Recently enacted legislation, actions recently taken by or proposed by the United States Department of Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Bank or other governmental entities, and legislation enacted in the future subject Comerica to increased regulation, and the impact and expiration of such legislation and regulatory actions may adversely affect Comerica.   On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the "EESA") was signed into law. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury was granted the authority to take a range of actions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets and has proposed several programs, including the purchase by the U.S. Treasury of certain troubled assets from financial institutions and the direct purchase by the U.S. Treasury of equity of financial institutions. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. In connection therewith, the U.S. Treasury introduced the Capital Purchase Program, under which it has purchased approximately $196 billion of preferred stock in eligible institutions, including Comerica, to increase the flow of financing to U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the U.S. economy. The EESA also temporarily raised the limit on federal deposit insurance coverage provided by the FDIC from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor.  On May 20, 2009, the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009, which extended the temporary increase in the standard maximum deposit insurance amount provided by the FDIC to $250,000 per depositor through December 31, 2013, was signed into law. This extension of the temporary $250,000 coverage limit (pursuant to the EESA) became effective immediately upon the   13      Table of Contents   President's signature. The legislation provides that the standard maximum deposit insurance amount provided by the FDIC will return to $100,000 on January 1, 2014.  On October 14, 2008, the FDIC announced the development of a guarantee program under the systemic risk exception to the Federal Deposit Act. As a result of this regulatory initiative, the FDIC implemented the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program ("TLGP") to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system. The TLGP is comprised of the Debt Guarantee Program ("DGP") and the Transaction Account Guarantee Program ("TAGP"). The DGP guaranteed all newly issued senior unsecured debt (e.g., promissory notes, unsubordinated unsecured notes and commercial paper) up to prescribed limits issued by participating entities beginning on October 14, 2008 and continued through October 31, 2009. For eligible debt issued by that date, the FDIC will provide the guarantee coverage until the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or December 31, 2012 (or June 30, 2012 for debt issued prior to April 1, 2009). The TAGP offers full guarantee for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts held at FDIC-insured depository institutions. The unlimited deposit coverage was voluntary for eligible institutions and was in addition to the $250,000 FDIC deposit insurance per account that was included as part of the EESA and the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act, respectively. The limits are presently scheduled to return to $100,000 on January 1, 2014. The TAGP coverage became effective on October 14, 2008 and will continue for Comerica and participating institutions until June 30, 2010.  During the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC levied an industry-wide special assessment charge on insured financial institutions as part of the agency's efforts to rebuild DIF. In November 2009, the FDIC amended regulations that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010-2012. The prepaid assessments will be applied against future quarterly assessments (as they may be so revised) until the prepaid assessment is exhausted or the balance of the prepayment is returned, whichever occurs first. The FDIC is not precluded from changing assessment rates or from further revising the risk-based assessment system during the prepayment period or thereafter. Thus, we may also be required to pay significantly higher FDIC insurance assessments premiums in the future because market developments significantly depleted DIF and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.  The programs and regulations established or to be established under the EESA and Capital Purchase Program may have adverse effects upon Comerica. It may face increased regulation of the financial services industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase Comerica's costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities. Also, participation in specific programs may subject Comerica to additional restrictions. For example, Comerica's participation in the Capital Purchase Program limits, without the consent of the U.S. Treasury, its ability to (a) increase its quarterly dividend above $0.33 per common share (the quarterly dividend rate in effect as of November 14, 2008) or (b) repurchase any of its shares with limited exceptions, most significantly purchases in connection with benefit plans. Comerica also issued a warrant to purchase 11,479,592 million of its common shares at an exercise price of $29.40 per share. These restrictions, as well as the potential dilutive impact of the warrant, may have an adverse effect on the market price of its common stock. Comerica's participation in the TAGP will require the payment of additional insurance premiums to the FDIC, in addition to the FDIC's regular and special assessments. The affects of such recently enacted legislation and regulatory actions on Comerica cannot reliably be determined at this time. Moreover, as some of the legislation and regulatory actions previously implemented in response to the recent financial crisis expire, the impact of the conclusion of these programs on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown. Any delay in the economic recovery or a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could adversely affect Comerica.   14      Table of Contents  Recently, the Federal Reserve adopted amendments to its Regulation E that will be effective on July 1, 2010. The changes will affect the circumstances when Comerica will be able to charge its clients overdraft fees.  On January 14, 2010, the current administration announced a proposal to impose a fee (the "Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee") on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the U.S. government to stabilize the financial system. If implemented as initially proposed, the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee will be applied to firms with over $50 billion in consolidated assets, and, therefore, by its terms would apply to Comerica. The Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, if implemented as proposed by the current administration, would go into effect on June 30, 2010 and remain in place for at least ten years.  In addition, there have been a number of recent legislative and regulatory proposals that could have an impact on the operations of Comerica and its subsidiaries. We can neither predict when or whether regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be. The impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on Comerica's businesses or operations cannot be reliably determined at this time, and such impact may adversely affect Comerica.    •Unfavorable developments concerning credit quality could adversely affect Comerica's financial results.   Although Comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. Under such circumstances, Comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and reserve for credit losses, which could adversely affect Comerica's financial results.    •Problems faced by residential real estate developers could adversely impact Comerica.   Problems in the United States' residential real estate development industry, specifically in Michigan (Midwest market) and both northern and southern California (Western market), have materially and adversely impacted Comerica in recent periods. Poor economic conditions have resulted in decreased demand for residential housing, which, in turn, has adversely affected the development and construction efforts of residential real estate developers. Consequently, the current economic downturn has adversely affected the ability of such residential real estate developer borrowers to repay these loans and the value of property used as collateral for such loans. These problems facing residential real estate developers have had, and the continuation or worsening of such problems may have, a material and adverse impact on the financial results of Comerica.    •Businesses or industries in which Comerica has lending concentrations, including, but not limited to, automotive production industry and the real estate business, could suffer a significant decline which could adversely affect Comerica.   Comerica's business customer base consists, in part, of lending concentrations in volatile businesses and industries such as the automotive production industry and the real estate business. Recent economic conditions have significantly impacted such businesses, which has adversely affected Comerica. In the event of a continued or worsening downturn in the economy or further decline in any one of those customers' businesses or industries, Comerica could experience increased credit losses, and its business could be materially adversely affected.    •The introduction, implementation, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies, including, but not limited to, the opening of new banking centers, may be less successful or may be different than anticipated, which could adversely affect Comerica's business.   Comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products. If Comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product   15      Table of Contents  needs, it could result in Comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue, which could result in a material adverse effect on its business.    •Utilization of technology to efficiently and effectively develop, market and deliver new products and services.   The financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Comerica's future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands and create additional efficiencies in Comerica's operations. Comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers, which could have a material adverse impact on Comerica's financial condition and results of operations.    •Operational difficulties or information security problems could adversely affect Comerica's business and operations.   Comerica is exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions. Comerica may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, which may include, for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages or natural disasters. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to Comerica. In addition there is the risk that Comerica's controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. Any such occurrences or failures could materially and adversely affect Comerica's business and operations by exposing it to potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention.    •Changes in the financial markets, including fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing, could adversely affect Comerica's net interest income and balance sheet.   The operations of financial institutions such as Comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions, the trade, fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which in turn significantly affect financial institutions' net interest income. Volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments, such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles, which, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements, generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions. Comerica's financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions.    •Competitive product and pricing pressures among financial institutions within Comerica's markets may change.   Comerica operates in a very competitive environment, which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates. Comerica competes with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions in terms of products and pricing. If Comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets, business could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations.   16      Table of Contents  •Customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices generally may be different than anticipated.   Comerica uses a variety of financial tools, models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements. Individual, economic, political, industry-specific conditions and other factors outside of Comerica's control, such as fuel prices, energy costs, real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels, could alter predicted customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices. Such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect Comerica's ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements.    •Management's ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations.   The financial services industry is very competitive. Comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers, but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers. While management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships, Comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers. Failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact Comerica's earnings.    •Management's ability to retain key officers and employees may change.   Comerica's future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel. Comerica's future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management, financial, technical, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and Comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult for Comerica to hire personnel over time.  Comerica's ability to retain key officers and employees may be further impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry. On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "ARRA") was signed into law. Section 7001 of the ARRA amended Section 111 of the EESA in its entirety. On June 10, 2009, the U.S. Treasury released an interim final rule (the "IFR"), effective June 15, 2009, that provided guidance on the compensation and governance standards for Troubled Asset Relief Program ("TARP") recipients, and promulgated regulations to implement the restrictions and standards set forth in Section 7001 of the ARRA. Among other things, the IFR and ARRA significantly expanded the executive compensation restrictions previously imposed by the EESA. Such restrictions apply to any entity that has received or will receive financial assistance under the TARP, and shall generally continue to apply for as long as any obligation arising from financial assistance provided under TARP, including preferred stock issued under the Capital Purchase Program, remains outstanding. These ARRA restrictions shall not apply to any TARP recipient during such time when the federal government (i) only holds any warrants to purchase common stock of such recipient or (ii) does not hold any preferred stock or warrants to purchase common stock of such recipient. As a result of our participation in the Capital Purchase Program, the restrictions and standards set forth in Section 7001 of the ARRA, as well as the IFR promulgated by the U.S. Treasury, shall be applicable to Comerica. Such restrictions and standards may further impact management's ability to compete with financial institutions that are not subject to the same limitations as Comerica under Section 7001 of the ARRA and the IFR.   17      Table of Contents  Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees, or Comerica's inability to attract and retain skilled employees.    •Legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters with respect to the financial services industry, including those directly involving Comerica and its subsidiaries, could adversely affect Comerica or the financial services industry in general.   Comerica has been, and may in the future be, subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and there can be no assurance that Comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation. Any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of Comerica's efforts, which by itself could have a material adverse effect on Comerica's financial condition and operating results. Further, adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by Comerica's regulators that could materially adversely affect Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations.    •Changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on Comerica's operations.   Comerica is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Texas Department of Banking, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory bodies. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which Comerica may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on Comerica's operations, investigations and limitations related to Comerica's securities, the classification of Comerica's assets and determination of the level of Comerica's allowance for loan losses. In light of the current conditions in the U.S. financial markets and economy, Congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations.    •Methods of reducing risk exposures might not be effective.   Instruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit, market and liquidity, operational, compliance, business risks and enterprise-wide risk could be less effective than anticipated. As a result, Comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk, which could have a material adverse impact on Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations.    •Terrorist activities or other hostilities may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and Comerica.   Terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt Comerica's operations or those of its customers. In addition, these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular, which could harm Comerica's operations. Any of these events could increase volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets, which could harm Comerica's stock price and may limit the capital resources available to Comerica and its customers. This could have a material adverse impact on Comerica's operating results, revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of Comerica's common stock.   18      Table of Contents  •Natural disasters, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires and floods, may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and Comerica.   Comerica has significant operations and a significant customer base in California, Texas, Florida and other regions where natural disasters may occur. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires and floods. These types of natural disasters at times have disrupted the local economy, Comerica's business and customers and have posed physical risks to Comerica's property. A significant natural disaster could materially adversely affect Comerica's operating results.        Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
