Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  As a leading investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock’s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market and operating risks, BlackRock’s business, financial condition, operating results or non-operating results could be materially adversely affected, however, by any of the following risks.  Risks Related to BlackRock’s Business and Competition  Changes in the value levels of the capital markets or other asset classes could lead to a decline in revenues and earnings.  BlackRock’s investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns earned on AUM. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory, administration and performance fees or earnings:        •    the value of AUM to decrease;        •    the returns realized on AUM to decrease;        •    clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve;        •    clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that it does not manage;        •    clients to rebalance assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees; and        •    an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill.  Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues and earnings.  The Company’s management believes that investment performance is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors could reduce revenues and cause earnings to decline as a result of:        •    existing clients withdrawing funds in favor of better performing products, which could result in lower investment advisory and administration fees;        •    the diminishing ability to attract funds from existing and new clients;        •    the Company earning minimal or no performance fees; and        •    an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill.  BlackRock may elect to provide support to its products from time to time.  BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time support investment products through capital or credit support. See, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Such support utilizes capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses on such support, or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products, could have an adverse impact on revenues and earnings.  Changes in the value levels of the capital markets or other asset classes could lead to a decline in the value of investments that BlackRock owns.  At December 31, 2009, BlackRock held approximately $1 billion of investments that are reflected on its statement of financial condition. Approximately $0.5 billion of this amount is the result of consolidation of certain sponsored investment funds. BlackRock’s economic interest in these investments is primarily the result of seed and co-investments in its sponsored investment funds. A decline in the prices of stocks or bonds, or the value of real estate or other alternative investments within or outside the United States could lower the value of these investments and result in a decline of non-operating income and increased volatility to earnings.    26    Table of Contents   Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)    Continued capital losses on investments could have adverse income tax consequences.  The Company may generate realized and unrealized capital losses on seed investments and co-investments. Realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes. The Company has unrealized capital losses for which a deferred tax asset has been established. In the event such unrealized losses are realized, the Company may not be able to offset such losses within the carryback or carryforward period or from future realized capital gains, in which case the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The failure to utilize the deferred tax asset could materially increase BlackRock's income tax expense.  The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect BlackRock.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. BlackRock, and the products and accounts that it manages, have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose BlackRock or the funds and accounts that it manages to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely impact BlackRock’s revenues and earnings. The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to reduced AUM in similar products of BlackRock without regard to the performance of BlackRock’s products.  The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products of BlackRock without regard to the performance of BlackRock’s products. Such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on our AUM, revenues and earnings.  Loss of key employees could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues.  The ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to BlackRock’s growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining clients. The market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, financial advisers and other professionals is competitive. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain required personnel. Loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company.  BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.  Separate account and commingled trust clients may terminate their investment management contracts with BlackRock or withdraw funds on short notice. The Company has, from time to time, lost separate accounts and could, in the future, lose accounts or significant AUM under various circumstances such as adverse market conditions or poor performance.  Additionally, BlackRock manages its U.S. mutual funds and exchanged traded funds under management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds’ boards of directors annually. A majority of the directors of each mutual fund are independent from BlackRock. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund managed by the Company will approve the fund’s management contract each year, or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to the Company.  Further, the governing agreements of many of the Company’s private investment funds generally provide that, subject to certain conditions, investors in those funds, and in some cases independent directors of those funds, may remove the investment adviser, general partner or the equivalent of the fund or liquidate the fund without cause by a simple majority vote, resulting in a reduction in the management or performance fees as well as the total carried interest BlackRock could earn.    27    Table of Contents   Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)    Failure to comply with client contractual requirements and/or guidelines could result in damage awards against BlackRock and loss of revenues due to client terminations.  When clients retain BlackRock to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf, they specify guidelines or contractual requirements that the Company is required to observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to BlackRock’s reputation or in its clients seeking to recover losses, withdrawing their AUM or terminating their contracts, any of which could cause the Company’s revenues and earnings to decline.  Competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins.  The investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. To the extent that the Company is forced to compete on the basis of price, it may not be able to maintain its current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause revenues and profit margins to decline.  Performance fees may increase earnings volatility, which could decrease BlackRock’s stock price.  A portion of the Company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments. In most cases, performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns, although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards. Generally, the Company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, performance fees for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. Performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition, causing earnings to be more volatile. The volatility in earnings may decrease BlackRock’s stock price. Performance fees represented $202 million, or 4%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009.  Additional acquisitions may decrease earnings and harm the Company’s competitive position.  BlackRock employs a variety of strategies intended to enhance earnings and expand product offerings in order to improve profit margins. These strategies have included smaller-sized lift-outs of investment teams and acquisitions of investment management businesses, such as the MLIM, Quellos and BGI Transactions. These strategies may not be effective and failure to successfully develop and implement these strategies may decrease earnings and harm the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry. In the event BlackRock pursues additional sizeable acquisitions, it may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices and it may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from such acquisitions.    28    Table of Contents   Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)    Risks Related to BlackRock’s Operations  Failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.  The Company’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers, backup facilities and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. The failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of its business, including any expansion, could impede the Company’s productivity and growth, which could cause the Company’s earnings or stock price to decline.  Operating in international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, regulatory and other risks.  As a result of BlackRock’s extensive international business activities, the Company faces increased operational, regulatory, reputational and foreign exchange rate risks. The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support such international activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which could cause the Company’s earnings or stock price to decline.  Failure to maintain a technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues.  A key element to BlackRock’s continued success is the ability to maintain a technological advantage both in terms of operational efficiency and in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into BlackRock’s operating systems that support investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients. Moreover, the Company’s technological and software advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide various types of data. The failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes.  Failure to implement effective information security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in BlackRock’s earnings or stock price.  BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of its information security policies, procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and could result in material financial loss, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, could cause a decline in the Company’s earnings or stock price.  The failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock and its products.  BlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, custody and transfer agent roles and other operational needs. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendors to fulfill their obligations could lead to operational issues in certain products, which could result in financial losses for the Company and its clients.    29    Table of Contents   Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)    The continuing integration of the BGI business creates risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect profitability.  The BGI business and personnel are in the process of being integrated with BlackRock’s previously existing business and personnel. These transition activities are complex and the Company may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs including:        •    the diversion of management’s attention to integration matters;        •    difficulties in achieving expected synergies associated with the transaction;        •    difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;        •    difficulties in the assimilation of employees;        •    challenges in keeping existing clients and obtaining new clients, including potential conflicts of interest and client imposed concentration limits on the use of an investment manager; and        •    challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel.  As a result, the Company may not be able to realize the expected revenue growth and other benefits that it hopes to achieve from the transaction. In addition, BlackRock may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that would otherwise be spent on the development and expansion of its business and services.  Failure to manage risks in operating securities lending for clients could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues and liquidity  The size of BlackRock’s securities lending programs increased significantly with the completion of the BGI transaction. As part of these programs, BlackRock must manage risks associated with (i) ensuring that the value of the collateral held against the securities on loan does not decline in value or become illiquid and that its nature and value complies with regulatory requirements, (ii) the potential that a borrower may not return a security on a timely basis, (iii) the potential that the collateral held may not be sufficient to repurchase the loaned security, and (iv) errors in the settlement of securities, daily mark-to-market valuations and collateral collection. The failure of the Company’s controls to mitigate these risks could result in financial losses for our clients that participate in our securities lending programs as well as for the Company.  Risks Related to Relationships with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC, Barclays and Other Institutional Investors  Merrill Lynch is an important distributor of BlackRock’s products, and the Company is therefore subject to risks associated with the business of Merrill Lynch.  Under a global distribution agreement entered into with Merrill Lynch, Merrill Lynch provides distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through its various distribution channels. The Company may not be successful in distributing products through Merrill Lynch or in distributing its products and services through other third party distributors. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it experiences an increase in distribution-related costs, BlackRock’s business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected.    30    Table of Contents   Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)    Loss of market share with Merrill Lynch’s Global Wealth & Investment Management business could harm operating results.  A significant portion of BlackRock’s revenue has historically come from AUM generated by Merrill Lynch’s Global Wealth & Investment Management (“GWIM”) business. BlackRock’s ability to maintain a strong relationship with GWIM is material to the Company’s future performance. If one of the Company’s competitors gains significant additional market share within the GWIM retail channel at the expense of BlackRock, then BlackRock’s business, results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted.  The failure of Barclays to fulfill its commitments, or the inadequacy of the support provided, under certain capital support agreements in favor of a number of securities lending related cash management funds acquired in the BGI Transaction, could negatively impact such funds and BlackRock.  Barclays has provided capital support agreements to support certain securities lending related cash management products acquired by BlackRock in the BGI Transaction. The failure of Barclays to fulfill its obligations under these agreements, or the inadequacy of the support provided, could cause our clients to suffer losses and BlackRock to suffer reputational and other adverse impacts. For a discussion on the capital support agreements see “Management, Discussion and Analysis – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Barclays Support of Certain Securities Lending Related Cash Funds.”  For so long as Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays maintain certain levels of stock ownership, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays will vote as stockholders in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays.  Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays have agreed to vote all of their shares in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors to the extent consistent with the provisions of their respective stockholder agreements with BlackRock. As a consequence, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will likely be approved or disapproved solely in accordance with the determinations of the BlackRock Board of Directors, so long as the shares held by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding shares. This arrangement has the effect of concentrating control over BlackRock in its Board of Directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the Board. At December 31, 2009, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays owned approximately 3.7%, 35.2% and 4.8%, respectively, of BlackRock’s voting common stock.  The majority of our stock is held by a group of large shareholders. Future sales of our common stock in the public market by us or our large stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  As of December 31, 2009, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays owned 34.2%, 24.5% and 19.8% of our capital stock, respectively. In connection with the BGI Transaction, 16.4 million shares were sold to other institutional investors. We have entered into registration rights agreements with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays, as well as the institutional investors who purchased shares of BlackRock capital stock in connection with the BGI Transaction. The registration rights agreements, which include customary “piggyback” registration provisions, allow the respective stockholders to cause us to file one or more registration statements for the resale of their respective shares of capital stock and cooperate in certain underwritten offerings. Sales by us or our large stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market pursuant to registration rights or otherwise, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.    31    Table of Contents   Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)    Legal and Regulatory Risks  BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and internationally.  BlackRock’s business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and around the world. See the discussion under the heading “Business – Regulation.” Violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, temporary or permanent prohibition of the engagement in certain activities, reputational harm, suspensions of personnel or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser or broker-dealer registrations, or other sanctions, which could cause the Company’s earnings or stock price to decline.  BlackRock may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes in the United States and internationally.  Recent market disruptions have led to numerous proposals in the United States and internationally for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry. New laws or regulations, or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities, could require BlackRock to change certain business practices and could expose BlackRock to additional costs (including increased capital, compliance and tax costs) as well as reputational harm. Regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions, could adversely impact the value of assets in which BlackRock has invested directly and on behalf of clients, and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms, could make it more difficult for BlackRock to conduct certain businesses or to distinguish itself from competitors.  Failure to comply with the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act and related regulations could result in substantial harm to BlackRock’s reputation and results of operations.  Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act and BlackRock’s U.S. mutual funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations and fiduciary duties on registered investment advisers, including record-keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act imposes similar obligations, as well as additional detailed operational requirements, on investment advisers to registered investment companies. The failure of any of BlackRock’s subsidiaries to comply with the Advisers Act or the Investment Company Act could cause the SEC to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts, including censure, termination of an investment adviser’s registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to SEC-registered funds, and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to the Company’s reputation, any of which could cause its earnings or stock price to decline.  Failure to comply with ERISA regulations could result in penalties and cause the Company’s earnings or stock price to decline.  Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to ERISA and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit specified transactions involving ERISA plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The failure of any of the relevant subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties that could reduce the Company’s earnings or cause its stock price to decline.    32    Table of Contents   Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)    BlackRock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities.  Because the total equity ownership interest of each of Bank of America and PNC in BlackRock exceeds 25% on an economic or voting basis, BlackRock is deemed to be a non-bank subsidiary of each of Bank of America and PNC, which are both financial holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As a non-bank subsidiary of Bank of America and PNC, BlackRock is subject to banking regulation, including the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve. Such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that BlackRock may conduct. The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit BlackRock from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting BlackRock’s business, and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. Any failure of either Bank of America or PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. In addition, BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary is subject to regulation by the OCC parallel in many respects to that imposed under the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act as described above and to capital requirements established by the OCC. The OCC has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary. Being subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations.  Failure to comply with laws and regulations in the United Kingdom, other member states of the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates could result in substantial harm to BlackRock’s reputation and results of operations.  The Financial Services Authority (the “FSA”) regulates BlackRock’s subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FSA is required to conduct any financial services-related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSA’s rules govern a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients and systems and controls. Breaches of these rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries.  In addition, these subsidiaries, and other European subsidiaries, branches or representative offices, must comply with the pan-European regime established by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which regulates the provision of investment services throughout the European Economic Area, as well as the Capital Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital requirements.  In Japan, certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the “FIEL”) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL.  In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (the “ASIC”) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. Failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the relevant subsidiaries’ licenses in Australia.    33    Table of Contents   Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)    The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the “SFO”) which governs the securities and futures markets and the non-bank retail leveraged foreign exchange market in Hong Kong. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the “SFC”), an independent non-governmental body. The relevant subsidiaries, and certain individuals representing them, which conduct business in any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are generally required to be registered or licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time.  There are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business or where the funds and products it manages are organized. Failure to comply with laws and regulations in any of these jurisdictions could result in substantial harm to BlackRock’s reputation and results of operation.  Legal proceedings could adversely affect operating results and financial condition for a particular period.  Many aspects of BlackRock’s business involve substantial risks of legal liability. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide or other investigations or proceedings. Additionally, certain of the investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which could potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages.  The legislative and economic effects of climate change could impact investment strategies and the value of assets that BlackRock manages.   BlackRock invests in a variety of sectors on behalf of its clients. To the extent certain of these sectors are negatively impacted by climate change or legislation or international agreements related to climate change, the value of, and the returns realized on, the related AUM could decrease or cause clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in sectors that BlackRock may not offer.    34    Table of Contents   Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
